My original intention was to use ML to determine WSB sentiment, however, I need proper training data.
Specifically, I need a new variable associated with every submission: sentiment.
But how do I determine sentiment? It's a dog biting its tail.
I could do it myself, manually, but then the results would be biased.
I could ask people on Reddit to help me do it, but even so, the bias could be even greater.

Therefore, I will try some algorithms first.

Firstly, I will use textblob to determine sentiment.
Then, I will try to do it manually, by creating a list of positive words and a list of negative words, 
and assigning a sentiment based on that, the score and the num_comments.
Now that I notice, I will need a sentiment table to track the sentiment evolution through time.
So, let's see how it goes.

Results:
the first method is cleary ineffective: textblob is not able to distinguish positive sentiment from negative sentiment;
