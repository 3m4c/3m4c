# TA Notes

* Resistance still at 416-418 gap fill on the 1d timeframe
* Support at 415-414
* 20 SMMA support. I believe we need to test the 20 SMMA so this will be dip buying opportunity if bullish.
* Expecting small moves today. Play tight and ITM 0dte if you're a degen.
* Bulls need to break 418 and test support. I think we top out at around 420 if 418 support holds.
* Bears need to break 414. I don't think we go below 410 tho but we shall see.
* Bullish üéØ - 419 - 420 - 420.53 - 422.29

2,BB,nri8c2,2021-06-03 18:58:06,$BB short interest and potential,"At this point we all either own $AMC $BB or $GME. We're well aware of the ~21% short interest on AMC and that the squeeze hasn't yet taken place. One of the big criticisms of $BB was a relatively low short interest compared to $AMC. Despite the fact that we all just like the stock I'm interested in the up tick in short interest on $BB. It's gone from 8.6% to 9.7% in a month. In some research today, 21% of the shares traded yesterday 6/2 were short. 

While I like $BB as a company, the Ape in me says this has much more potential than some are giving it. No $BB is not the new golden child that $AMC is and for good reason. But it appears to be the next best suited as short interest is growing and Ape Nation is organized behind hit.

7,BB,ntf8df,2021-06-06 08:16:40,$BB ideas for Monday,"Disclaimer: I got out from $BB on Friday.

$BB dropped below $14.30 (50% Fib Retracement mark). This mark was tested and rejected multiple time from Thursday through Friday. However at around 2pm $BB dropped bellow. Bulls immediately tried regaining this level but got rejected and we closed below. The next level is 61.8%, $13. Bulls must hold this one in my opinion. There's a big hole that is still unfilled when $BB gapped up from June 1st to 2nd. If $BB goes below $13, then we might retest June 1st closing of $11.56 and 78.6% retracement mark of $11.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/Pv2AQcyz/

Volume on Friday also wasn't great. Comparing it to Thursday is a bit unfair since that was a record breaking day. That being said, Friday volume was a half of what it was on Wednesday. This was also $BBs first negative day of this run. Looking back to January, first negative day of that run also coincided with lower volume and that was basically the end of that run. Volume was keep decreasing since that day going forward. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/onHdg7BE/

On Monday:

* If $BB opens above $14.30, it will most likely try and retest 50% retracement again. If we hold above, might be a good place to jump back in. 

* If $BB opens between $14.30 and $13, just wait and see, that's noman's land. If $BB starts to slide then I'm looking for a strong rejection at $13 before even thinking about jumping back in. If we go below $13, then there are good chances we'll retest $11.5 and $11 marks. If $BB starts the morning strong and goes up, watch what happens at $14.30. Going above and stabilizing that is a good sign. 
* And of course I'm looking for better volume than last Friday if there's to be continuation of this run.",DD,0.79

10,BB,ntp2xh,2021-06-06 18:07:01,No AMC or BB holders should be wearing pants and here's the analysis to prove it,"Like all of you, I was fascinated by Adam Aron's bold strategy to not wear pants in a [Zoom interview](https://www.crossingbroad.com/2021/06/adam-aron-did-not-appear-to-be-wearing-pants-on-this-zoom-call.html) last week. However, I was even more fascinated by the correlation between Aron's refusal to wear pants and the price of AMC. As you can see in my red crayon analysis below, Thursday saw a deep AMC dive, but quickly rebounded after Aron's daring refusal to wear pants during his interview. As a result of Aron's fearless leadership, tendies soared, and it rained diamonds. Of course, paper handed bitches  immediately started denying that Aron was pantsless, causing fear and doubt among the lesser apes, and AMC dropped on Friday.

But all this no pants business got me thinking. What about ***MY*** pants? If Aron's no pants correlation is true for AMC, is it also true for BB? Luckily, I hadn't yet eaten all of my red crayons, allowing me to do another deep dive into BB, which is also posted below. As any true smooth brainer can see, there is an obvious correlation between whether I had pants on and the price of BB. I was WFH on Tuesday and Wednesday, so obviously I refused to wear pants, and BB soared as a result. However, my batshit crazy boss made me come in for a half day on Thursday, and I had to wear pants for some of that day, resulting in pants confusion and a volatile BB market. Friday was terrible, as I had to return to the office for the ENTIRE day, resulting in horrible losses for BB.

The conclusion of my analysis is clear guys. DO NOT WEAR PANTS next week. If your boss won't let you WFH, then quit and go work for your wife's boyfriend.

TL/DR: **DO NOT WEAR PANTS THIS WEEK YOU RETARDS**

13,DD,nqxmty,2021-06-03 00:02:22,The Weekly DD - Corsair Gaming (CRSR): Rise of The Gamers," The video game industry has taken off since the pandemic and is expected to reach a value of \~**$290 billion by 2026**. How does this compare to the global box office industry? From 2019 to 2020 we saw revenues shift in the following:

**2019 -> 2020**

*Global Box Office*

\~42 billion (all-time-record) -> \~11.5 billion

*Gaming Industry*

\~152 billion -> \~164 billion

That‚Äôs right, in 2019 (pre-pandemic) the gaming industry was already over 3.5x the size of the box office entertainment industry and over 14x in 2020\*. Gaming‚Äôs 2020 growth outperformed the growth of both movies and sports combined ([source](https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/video-games-2020-revenues-outpace-movies-sports#:~:text=A%2520new%2520report%2520from%2520MarketWatch,both%2520movies%2520and%2520sports%2520combined.)).

There is a shift in the ecosystem from gaming for fun to becoming more of a social event, ie: hanging with friends *while* playing video games for the hobbyist gamer, and streaming for the professionals. Gaming, once thought to be an activity for the young, has proliferated through all age groups and demographics. In 2020, 64% of all American adults (214.4 million people) played video games ([source](https://venturebeat.com/2020/07/15/esa-ceo-64-of-u-s-adults-are-gamers-46-of-players-are-women-older-people-are-playing-more/))

https://preview.redd.it/mhmyyow5dx271.png?width=1172&format=png&auto=webp&s=30ab577faef9b2abdd438edf9162b5e372a76063

&#x200B;

Check out evolution of streaming platforms since the Pandemic. Out of the top 3 competitors (Twitch, Youtube, Facebook) Twitch was the clear winner here with users streaming and revenues jumping significantly. This massive expansion of total addressable market (TAM) is most likely a one time occurrence, but the gaming industry is still expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of roughly 11% moving forward.

**eSports**

Another beneficiary of the gaming industry boom, which is not talked about enough nor well-understood by many, are eSports. Essentially, eSports are gaming competitions that offer cash as prizes and draw YUGE crowds. The eSports industry alone is set to surpass \~1.1 billion in revenues in 2021, a 14% growth from 2020‚Äôs \~950 million. To put things in perspective some of the top eSports events compete with the US Open Tennis and US Open Golf tournaments where the winner takes home *millions* of dollars.

**Enters Corsair Gaming (CRSR)**

What is Corsair Gaming (CRSR)? They are a designer and manufacturer of high-end gear for all things PC gaming. They offer four different segments of products, almost all of which have 5-star ratings on Amazon.

&#x200B;

1. PC peripherals: keyboards, headsets, mice, mousepads, chais, etc.
2. Streaming equipment: green screens, capture cards, microphones.
3. PC components: almost anything outside the graphics card that can be found inside the PC tower (the big metal box that the computer is made of).
4. Gaming PCs for those that don‚Äôt want to self-customize their own.

**Corsair - Outlook**

With the rise of gaming comes new opportunity for CRSR to expand its sales. In 2021, the PC gaming market was estimated to be $45.5B with \~50% of all gamers using a PC to play video games ([source](https://fortunly.com/statistics/video-game-industry-statistics/)). This creates a very opportune market for those who can provide value to the PC gamer.

The target market who purchases peripherals are a passionate, well-researched group with access to many other brands. Therefore, only a well-liked (and popular) brand can succeed in this market ([source](https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/gaming-peripheral-branding-data-brands-consumer-research/)). Thus, the market advantages large incumbents over smaller up-and-comers. Their brand value is also obvious in the premiums that their brand allows them to charge. Their gaming components and systems products, which they are currently the market leader, demands an average of \~40% premiums compared to their competitors! This means their products cost 40% more, on average, than their competitors and they are still out-selling them.

**Final Thoughts**

Given the rapid growth of the gaming industry boosted by the COVID-19 pandemic, CRSR is on track to capture a large segment of this growth and expand its business as a result. However, CRSR is not expected to have any massive shifts in its business nor do their growth strategies include any drastic changes to their current strategy. Corsair is a premium brand with solid market penetration. Although they may not experience the same explosive from 2019 to 2020, they are in a great position to remain a market leader in a fast-growing industry.

**Positions:** None right now, but I've sold puts on CRSR over the last 6 months. Will be selling again on next red day.",DD,0.95

\*\*\*My average in @ $5.10, currently at $5.52, May 20th, 2021

I am not investing in the company as a get-rich-quick scheme, but plan to hold long term. **Saphyr** technology will continue to improve directly with design improvements, but also indirectly with the data that it continuously collects will create more accurate correlations of DNA with individual predispositions for disease. 

I believe the technology will allow for a more personal approach in the field of medicine, and should not be viewed solely as a research-based company.  

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community. 

* **Large institutional investments have nearly tripled (3X) from 5% to 14%.** 
* **Earnings beat expectations in Q1 2021.**
* **Recent large insider procurement.**
* **New patents, research breakthroughs, Large Lab facility adoption.**

This is why I have a strong conviction for **Bionano Genomics (BNGO)** being a great growth stock to investigate and follow. 

There are some negative indicators fundamentally, but considering Bionano is still in its infancy I am very optimistic in my outlook. The positives tip the scale in my opinion and at the very least, Bianano Genomics (BNGO) should be on your watchlist!

**I look forward to the comments and welcome skeptical viewpoints. Open to hearing what other perceptions and expectations are of this company, Thanks for reading!!!!**

21,UWMC,nbkat0,2021-05-13 18:12:36,Why Boomers and Millennials like $UWMC,"Boomers and Millennials agree on little nowadays. One is lazy, doesn't listen, already knows everything, and only thinks about themselves. The other are millennials. But $UWMC is a stock both can buy and hold for short term or long term. Here's why:

**The millennials case for $UWMC:**

Stock Deeply Undervalued: millennials love stocks that hedgies have (allegedly) artificially pushed down the price. UWM is a growing company and Wall Street has positioned itself as if UWM is shrinking.

Share Buybacks: millennials will recognize this buyback is different then say Apple. With $300 million in buybacks, UWM can reduce the whole float by almost 40%.

Option Open Interest: There are 131,934 open interest in options (as of this morning) with strikes at $10 and under. That is a lot of shares that the sellers of those options would need to find. The float could be reduced significantly by share buybacks at that time. Institutional investors easily control 20+million shares and they aren't selling at these prices. Gores holds 15.8m shares they bought for $10 a few months ago.

CEO: Mat is pissed Wall Street doesn't love his company as much as he does. He will do what it takes to get the price to what he needs it to be with the buybacks. He is game to play.

**The boomer case for $UWMC:**

Mortgages: Boomers love mortgages, the bigger the better. UWM is the largest wholesale mortgage provider in America. The mortgage industry isn't going anywhere and boomer's small brains can at least understand that.

Healthy Financials: UWM runs a tight ship and is very profitable. It also trades at a low P/E around 6 or so. Boomers love low P/E's cause they hate tech and tech is ""expensive"". They buy low P/E companies like T cause they are much smarter than millennials at investing.

Dividends: Boomers love dividends. They think it is free money. At a $7.5 stock price $UWMC pays a 5.3% dividend. But even better, UWM pays a dividend on its class A shares only. Class A is only 7% of the outstanding shares, so it costs UWM $42 million to pay a 5.3% dividend. For context, their net income Q1 was $800m+.

Share Buybacks: Boomers love getting their capital returned in a slow, and boring way. UWMC has a $300 million share buyback underway right now.

Mat Ishbia: Mat is a CEO boomers love. He played team sports and won an NCAA national championship riding the bench at Michigan State. Boomers love reading stories like that because they always preached hard work to their own kids from the couch.

So either a short term or long term investment, boomer or millenial, $UWMC looks interesting.",DD,0.88

* $13.70 to $14.35 looks to be the next volume supply zone to take out.

&#x200B;

* If it breaks above $14.35 it could test all time high of $17.45. Usually I'd imagine this would be a longer timeline (weeks, months) but if there is any kind of short squeezing obviously things can happen fast like we saw today.

42,FOR,nfg8mj,2021-05-18 19:11:21,$AMC TA - BROKE OUT BIG LAST WEEK - BEST SETUP SINCE THE FIRST SQUEEZE - NEEDS TO BREAK KEY RESISTANCE FOR ROCKETS THRUSTERS TO ENGAGE AGAIN,"A lot of people from my $GME post were curious about the technicals on $AMC - so I figured I would post them as well.

Actually, AMC was my inspiration for looking deeper into the GME chart - it had/has a **fantastic setup**.

[AMC TA](https://preview.redd.it/gju8synduwz61.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=46c863adbb144c04e3327bb212a79bb1633608fc)

Broke a massive falling wedge on the daily chart with a great increase in volume. It's also a cup and handle dating back to January. There was even confluence with key resistance near the breakout point @ **11.58.**

**13.24** is key support now, keep an eye on that.

We have been coiling under key resistance for a few days (**14.53) THE SECOND THIS BREAKS, WE ARE CLEAR FOR TAKEOFF (AGAIN).** Also - note the way we are coiling upwards below key resistance is a very bullish data point. Volume is declining as we chop up.

Price targets are **17.25 & 20.36.**

This is the best setup I've seen in this stock since the initial squeeze. Remember, keep it simple.

***TL;DR -*** AMC actually looks good for once from an **unbiased** technical standpoint

Not Financial Advice

Edit: Only thing I forgot to mention was the upper trendline of the wedge extends back to that 17.25 high - this is just another data point that adds to the validity of the breakout.

&#x200B;

\*\*\* If you aren't in TSM ( ***Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing***) you hate money. Here are some reasons you should look into this stock and buy it before it is too late. \*\*\*

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Economics 101, Supply and Demand.**

* TSM is the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the world
* THERE IS A WORLDWIDE SEMICONDUCTOR SHORTAGE
* Let me emphasize this point. THERE IS A WORLDWIDE SEMICONDUCTOR SHORTAGE

As many of you know, there is a worldwide semiconductor shortage (yes I said it again). These semiconductors are vital components in every electronic we use today. Without these semiconductors, things like smartphones, automobiles, video game consoles, etc. Would not be able to function.

(Read the following if you want to see why these semiconductors are so vital...or just completely trust me, that's fine too)

***\*ALL COMPUTERS NEEDS SEMICONDUCTORS TO FUNCTION\****

Semiconductors are used primarily in electronic devices, including chips, diodes, transistors, and integrated circuits. According to Goldman Sachs 169 industries rely on semiconductors. Anything that is computerized or uses radio waves depends on semiconductors. Your phone is a computer, your car is a computer, your video game consoles are computers, your amazon firestick is a computer, every aspect of your life is dependent on these semiconductors.

TSM PRODUCES THESE CHIPS FOR THE FOLLWOING COMPANIES AND MANY MORE:
-Apple
-Toyota
-NVIDIA
-AMD
-SO MANY MORE

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do you believe the future of automobiles are powered by electric? Not without semiconductors.

**Semiconductors in Automobiles**

1. **Vehicle electrification ‚Äì** Semiconductors have made it possible to replace manual systems with electrical systems. Electrification of key systems provides benefits such as increased vehicle efficiency, reductions in carbon emissions, and minimizing oil dependency.
2. **Safety and driver assistance ‚Äì** The increasing need for better safety and driver assistance systems in cars has provided a niche for semiconductors. Intelligent functions such as backup cameras, blind-spot detection, adaptive cruise control, lane change assist, airbag deployment, and emergency braking systems are all made possible through the integration of semiconductor technologies.
3. **Connectivity ‚Äì** Cars are increasingly incorporating technology that improves their connectivity. New vehicles on the market include ever-more sophisticated telematics (long-distance data transmission) and infotainment capabilities which feed drivers information on factors such as road closures, collision avoidance, and even free parking spaces at their destination. On-board computers which handle this information have to process millions of lines of code every second. Semiconductors allow cars to stay connected in real-time.

Semiconductors are key to the future of the electric vehicle (EV) industry as they help to control the powertrain and battery. Semiconductors are also used in the variety of touchscreens that are installed in the driver‚Äôs dash and in the back of passenger seats.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**FINANCIALS/NEWS**

* Financially, the company has reported its third straight quarter of record sales in its first-quarter earnings report back in April.
* Its revenue came in 25.4% higher year-over-year to 12.9 billion.
* The stock has more than doubled in price over the past year
* Japan‚Äôs government recently announced that it wants TSM and Sony to invest $9.2 billion to build the country‚Äôs first 20-nanometer chip plant.
* Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) said on Friday (5/21/2021) that it has increased its 2021 output for a key component for automotive semiconductors by 60% compared with last year, amid a global chip shortage.

These are just a couple of things. If This has caught your eye please research TSM on your own and you can find more great news and financial statements...or don't, you've made it this far, might as well go all in.

I wouldn't be surprised if most of it came from hedge funds, trying to get people to buy in so they can drop the bag somewhere along the way. I have a theory, that banning the word ""Squeeze"" would remove the shit quality DD, in hopes of seeing some good, retarded plays, based on shit that may, or may not happen in the future.

Like for example, SPCE is a retarded YOLO play, but there's an idea about its future. Gun stocks would be another retarded play if you were betting that CPI numbers will lead to raiding of stores, as people become desperate for supplies. However, most of the shit on it is ""bUY sHorT SqUeezE IncOmINg!!1!"" when the reality is that they want the price pumped up because now they have their position opened so they can make a quick buck. The amount of scrapers running over this reddit is so crazy that I could probably say ""Buy PLTR shares, short squeeze incoming"", and scrapers would be bought in within seconds, even if PLTR had 0% short interest.

Thus, I petition a temp ban of the word ""Squeeze"" in discussion, except for exceptional cases, where short interest is at 80%+ (This number can be negotiated). My bet is that DD quality will skyrocket, and if I could buy calls on it, I would be YOLOing on OTM ones, as far out as they go, because right now, DD is at an all-time low, so much so that I just skip the post.",Discussion,0.86

On May 11, UWM said it would repurchase up to $300 million of its shares over the next 24 months. This is a sort of dividend to shareholders.

With its $12.8 billion market cap, the $300 million represents a 2.34% buyback yield to shareholders (i.e., $300 million/$12.8 billion) over two years. This is also worth 1.17% annually, or 13.6 cents per share.

Add that to the 5.25%dividend yield (i.e., 40 cents annually divided by $7.68). So the ‚Äútotal yield‚Äù as I call it, is worth about 6.42% (i.e., 53.6 cents divided by $7.68). At $10 per share, the total yield is 5.36 % annually more appropriate valuation.

As there are about 1.605 billion shares outstanding, the adjusted EPS will be $1.16 per share. At the recent price of $7.38, this puts UMVC stock on a forward P/E of just 6.4 times forward earnings. That is very cheap.

My estimate of $1.16 is close to analysts‚Äô estimates, as seen by Seeking Alpha, of $1.14 per share. They also estimate $1.23 for next year. That puts UWMC stock on a forward P/E of just 6 times earnings.

I believe a more appropriate valuation is 8 times earnings. That puts the value at $9.84, or roughly $10 per share. This is a potential 36% gain for UWMC stock.",Discussion,0.86

&#x200B;

There is a TLDR after each section for more in depth details. Or a very broad TLDR at end.

# The Drone (CON)

1. ""Horse Fly"" is Work Horses last mile delivery drone launched from their delivery vehicle. Sounds great in theory and this is exactly what we expected the future to hold, right? Sure. As a consumer though do you really want your package to be dropped in your [front yard](https://youtu.be/05BaPqBXNT0?t=207) and have to walk to pick up your package or have a person put in literally in front of your door? A loud drone is also a huge ""HEY COME STEAL MY PACKAGE"" alarm.
   1. ""Horse Fly"" Me, the OP, being a student Pilot, I knew about airspaces and can Horse Fly even fly in the majority of US Airspace? Turns out they actually can, they claim on their website they have worked with the FAA to obtain permission which is a major PRO. As stated on their website: **""The HorseFly system is designed to conform to the FAA guidelines for UAV operation in the U.S. ""**
      1. However, you cannot really use this system in any densely populated area (like new york) for the simple fact you don't want drones flying around 10lb packages above thousands of humans heads all day. That's a lawsuit begging to happen.
2. The drone is limited to a 10lb payload, this even further reduces the actual amount of packagesit will be able to deliver. Ultimately this drone is pretty fucking useless as it's only use is in very sparsely populated areas or small suburban areas.

(1) **Tl;dr:**

The drones cannot be utilized everywhere in the USA, which greatly restricts their abilities considering the [majority of the US population lives in just a few different locations](http://ecpmlangues.u-strasbg.fr/civilization/geography/maps/US%20Population%20density,%202010.png) anywhere dark red would likely be unable for this drone. Drones are maintenance heavy and seem to still require human intervention. I just cant see the ultimate viability of drones compared to a human. Would be loud and attract thieves, and annoy customers.

# Continued Revenue (CON)

2.How will Work Horse continue to make money after i.e UPS buys all the trucks they want? Obviously UPS is not interested in buying the newest model every year, which means no new revenue for Work Horse. So what about maintenance? It appears as though Work Horse contracts out maintenance through Ryder Systems. [https://ryder.com/locations](https://ryder.com/locations). This would imply Work Horse will not be making money from maintenance.

1. Drone Maintenance? I haven't found anything on their website about this, but would it really be worth it for UPS to have to be constantly shipping these drones back to Work Horse for repairs and needing to keep extra drones on hand and constantly accessible? Or just pay a driver who is significantly more reliable?

&#x200B;

(2) **Tl;dr:**

Theres **no real potential for continued revenue** after workhorse sells a company their initial fleet, workhorse wont be the ones doing maintenance and the customer company wont be interested in a new fleet of the newest model each year.

&#x200B;

# Charging Costs (CON)

[reuters.com](https://reuters.com) Did an article about workhorse charging costs. **""Developing the battery plants and charging infrastructure to fund an electrified global vehicle fleet could require an investment of $2.7 trillion by manufacturers and governments "".**  Workhorse does not have anywhere near the required capital to build charging stations, which would likely leave the cost for UPS to cover. Not to mention EV doesn't change a god damn thing, we will create the electricity for the EV's by burning coal LOL [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ups-workhorse-group-electric-vehicles/ups-workhorse-electric-van-deal-shows-progress-on-charging-costs-idUSKCN1G61RZ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ups-workhorse-group-electric-vehicles/ups-workhorse-electric-van-deal-shows-progress-on-charging-costs-idUSKCN1G61RZ)

(3) T**l;dr** Infrastructure required will likely be so significantly expensive that the cost would never be recouped over any realistic time frame from the money being saved between electricity and petroleum costs by a customer company (like UPS). Besides, electricity on this size scale will be significantly more expensive than petroleum which just means you're consistently losing money by switching to an EV fleet.

&#x200B;

# Why Q4 FY 2020 Was so high (CON)

"" **Sales for the fourth quarter of 2020 were recorded at $652,000 compared to $3,000 in the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase in sales was due to a higher volume of trucks produced and delivered.** "" [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/01/2184359/0/en/Workhorse-Group-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Results.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/01/2184359/0/en/Workhorse-Group-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Results.html). The majority of this large increase was actually due to an investment workhorse made in $RIDE. The only quarters that will generate a profit is those that WKHS made a good investment or sold vehicles, they have no recurring or stable revenue source.

&#x200B;

# The MOASS (MAJOR PRO)

This stock has a huge potential for the Mother of All Short Squeezes. From [marketbeat.com](https://marketbeat.com) they claim 38.5% of workhorses shares are shorted. This is massive, and literally we just caught the shorts with their [pants down](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ns4bqz/amc_ceo_shows_us_he_isnt_wearing_pants/).

&#x200B;

# So why the fuck did you buy it then?

I bought it for the squeeze. WKHS Can gain a lot of potential with a larger capital if a squeeze were to occur.

&#x200B;

# Overall TL;DR:

Workhorse is a shit company in the long term and will never be able to scale appropriately given their current capital, but the short-term short squeeze could provide capital to allow for workhorse to build their own maintenance shops, charging stations, and dealerships around the US which will provide a stable revenue source. Currently they don't stand a chance against Amazon.

**TL;DR OF THE TL;DR:**

Company shit, short squeeze good.

Not only that but unlike some other short traps (like WISH which had a very low float so short % was artificially high), WISH's float is 85% of its shares outstanding so the short interest cannot be lowered simply by releasing shares from lockup. 

This all sets up for a massive squeeze in a short time span as short sellers simply cannot pay such a high borrow rate especially with shorts being targeted, the panic will set in soon and this will easily take off to $25 or higher.

I am all in on Jun 18th $20 calls as I believe a short squeeze is inevitable and coming ASAP once the crowd loses interest in WISH (fake high short interest) and CLOV",DD,0.75

UWMC wasn't on the first Russell preliminary list due to issues with the voting shares. (Russell miscalulated). This stock is plagued with Russell inclusion issues. First quarter, everyone thought it wasn't included due to the miscalculation of voting shares but it was because they came out as a SPAC and something regarding the SPAC and being listed that way, they weren't able to be listed in the first quarter. They're supposed to be added to this inclusion and now the voting shares were miscalculated like everyone thought was the reason in the first quarters listings. Now, it is in fact the voting shares which were miscalculated. I've sent an email to investor relations and received the response below that they're appealing it. I don't really care if they're added or not, but I'm happy that they jumped on it, we'll see.

Allow me to introduce you to a company with boomer level fundamentals that took a haircut during the pandemic and is set to fucking explode. 


The company name is Tellurian, ticker is $TELL.


--------MY KNOWLEDGE AND BACKGROUND----------

Even though I have a double digit IQ, I am in charge of keeping energy producers from blowing up, spilling fuck loads of oil, catching shit on fire, and/or keeping seafood fresh and hydrocarbon free. I've been in the business for many moons. I have dealt with MANY companies. I‚Äôve seen MANY business types, I have seen transitions in business models as producers have dealt with energy price crashes. I work directly with company executives all the way down to operators and hands. I like talking to everyone and absorbing as much knowledge as I can, even though I‚Äôm mentally retarded.

Even though you morons can‚Äôt read, have your wife‚Äôs/gf‚Äôs boyfriend read this to you and DRILL it in your fucking smooth brain: LIQUID NATURAL GAS (LNG) DEMAND IS RISING AND WILL CONTINUE TO RISE FOR THE NEXT DECADE (‚ÄúdEcAde‚Äù is a period of ten years for you single digit IQ fucks) AND BEYOND. LNG will be the ‚Äútransition‚Äù fuel between dirtier energy sources and ""green"" energy. This transition is coming sooner than we think. 


Are you following?


What's this LNG, you might ask. You need to liquefy gas (basically ‚Äúconcentrating‚Äù it) so that it becomes economical to ship overseas. Overseas markets for LNG is massive and growing. Seriously look it up, EU, China, and others are increasingly relying on the stuff. It‚Äôs much more expensive for them to produce than the US.

When a producer (the company that puts together millions of dollars to drill a well) drills for oil, if your drill and zone prediction (a ‚Äúzone‚Äù is the area that a geologist, paid for by the producer, finds to contain oil) is correct, 99% of the time, three products will flow to the earth‚Äôs surface in your process. These three are water, oil, and NATURAL GAS. Producers will separate oil and water dispose of this waste water into a disposal well thousands and thousands of feet deep. Producers will then sell the oil.‚Ä¶ What happens to the gas?? Well, if the producer is lucky, there will be a pipeline within a mile or two of their well. They will have to pay WAY over 200K to 500K just welding a mile of gas pipeline to tie into this sales line then pay 100 to 250K for a LACT unit. This is why oilfield welders have fewer IQs than I do but make $150/hr, depending upon pipeline wall thickness (dependent upon flowing pressures and how safe the producer wants to be if not bound by DOT regulations)

If these costs aren‚Äôt too high, and the well is producing as much product as expected, then great, they sell gas. However, if they're producing less oil than predicted, or they're producing thousand of barrels of water per day, their disposal costs will be so high, they can‚Äôt afford to build the pipeline, they will just burn the stuff. Seriously, I can not tell you HOW MUCH GAS IS JUST BURNED. The VAST majority of producers just ‚Äúflare‚Äù the gas. Just the ‚Äúflare‚Äù vessel is like $30K. Imaging paying $30K to burn LNG that's worth 100s of thousands of dollars. I worked in the Permian basin in West Texas. Anyone here with this experience can vouch for me. At night, in the Permian, the sky is literally lit up with these flares. It‚Äôs like you're a goddamn ant on a fucking birthday cake that‚Äôs for both for your great great great mothers and her boyfriend‚Äôs birthday (basically a shit load of candles). It‚Äôs an amazing sight.

¬≠---------wWhY dO tHeY DoO WasTE gAAS??------------------

You‚Äôre in the middle of fucking NOWHERE. You‚Äôd have to run hundreds of miles of pipeline to sell the gas. This would cost more than drilling the well. No company in their right mind would do this. The only options is to flare it. This one company I was working for was burning over 100K worth of natural gas per MONTH PER WELL, they had FIVE wells. The US just burns the crap, we can produce it so cheap, it just makes more sense to burn it rather than bothering to sell it. Gas is a nuisance to us. Other countries would die for it. There is actually new technologies that converts LNG into GASOLINE for cars. If you‚Äôre a stupid brain dead fuck who doesn't believe me, fucking Google it. 



-------So what about this TeLlUriAn coMpaNIee?-----------

Charif Souki started Tellurian. If you don‚Äôt know who he is, he is a LNG god. He was a banker on Wall St, highest paid CEO years ago, pioneered the LNG industry. He and his team are impeccable. If you want to build a LNG empire, you hire Souki, if you want to know the future of hydrocarbon energy, you hire Souki, if you want a new boyfriend for your wife, you hire Souki. He built Cheniere Enerny (about 2 hours from my house), a company with $10billion in revenue and is trading $80/share. 
He was fired because Carl Ichan was a complete bully. The business was not being built to Soukies vision. Soukie took the best staff members along with him and started Tellurian. Can you imagine their trust in this guy? Leaving an established company to start a new one... LNG business model is requiring a change and Soukie realizes this. It will need to be produced at less cost, current business models aren‚Äôt sustainable. Cheniere Energy is over 20 BILLION dollars in debt. Yes, $20 BILLIOOONNNNNNNN. Guess how much debt Tellurian has? ZERO, NONE, $0.00. This is UNHEARD of in a new company in this industry. 

Tellurian just signed a 10 BILLION dollar purchase agreement from ONE company. TELL is currently talking deals with at least 4 other companies. This 10 billion dollar deal is a 10 year agreement. This is 1 billion per year. Their current market cap is just over 1 billion. Do you realize yet how undervalued this company is?? It‚Äôs mind blowing. They begin their Driftwood facility construction in Louisiana this summer. This will be the terminal to export LNG, 32 billion dollar project.

Do you know whats even better?? They wont completely rely on third party producers selling them gas to liquefy, BECAUSE THEY DRILL AND PRODUCE THEIR OWN GAS. They started drilling again after a brief pause due to covid-19. We pay for monthly reports of all producers who receive state permits for drilling. Just this month Tellurian has TWO permits.

Souki uploads regularly to YouTube (seriously what other major high level executive does this??), he was on Jim Cramers show multiple times, Jim Cramer was always contrary to Souki‚Äôs predictions, and SOUKI ALWAYS turned out RIGHT. Look it up, these are Jim Crammer‚Äôs words, NOT mine. Just a day or two ago, Souki said in his YouTube video ‚Äúwe are preparing for the ride of a lifetime.‚Äù I assume this is his way of telling us ‚Äúbuy in now you fucking retards‚Äù without being fined by the SEC.

------------HOW is ThiS LIKE GME, AMC, BB?-----------------

THE SHORT POSITIONS OMG YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS BY NOW. IT‚ÄôS 17%!! Most of these positions were taken out at pandemic start. The joke is on them, Tellurian paid off their debts during their worst time HAHAHAHAHA. There WILL be a short squeeze. These shorts have no fucking clue about this dream team, the true depth of industry, and future of LNG production. 


---------------------hOw MuchH CanI MAKe?---------------------

At the VERY VERY least, I‚Äôm betting we run to pandemic level of $10-11/share (REMEMBER THIS WAS BEFORE THEY EVEN SIGNED ANY PURCHASE AGREEMENTS!!!). Calls are still cheap.

111,USA,nthp3b,2021-06-06 11:11:28,"DD RNG potential if compared with Hydrogen &amp; BEVs, USA (California) regulatory and legislative focus","Hello everyone, 

here a DD focused on RNG and Natural Gas developments in the USA, as previous one was more broad and had the intention to outline the state of the industry worldwide.

As you may know, California has always been at the center of attention as the most advanced state in terms of decarbonization efforts. Yet, it seems that not all decisions paid back in terms of quality of life and certainty of business activity.

**Californian** **Natural Gas power plants shut down, electricity imported from other states:**

Indeed, California, different from what someone would expect, has not a good and reliable supply of electricity, probably because it pushed too aggressively for the state's 100% electrification goal (see attached picture). During the most recent blackout in August 2020, some Electric buses were forced to shut down, in order to reduce electricity demand. In the next decade, virtual power plants' alike experiments will be more popular, therefore it is reasonable to expect a better match between the demand & supply of green electricity. But it will take time and for safety reasons, it would be better to rely on different sources of energy.

* [2020-08-21 Washington Examiner: California forced to defend green goals amid blackouts](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/california-forced-to-defend-green-goals-amid-blackouts)
* [2020-08-23 Oil & Gas 360 : Green California has the nation's worst power grid](https://www.oilandgas360.com/green-california-has-the-nations-worst-power-grid/)

The first question that arises, reading these topics, is about the never-ending announcements of companies like Nikola $NKLA (very dubious business potential) and Tesla $TSLA (amazing company with incredible potential) about the incoming, quick and easy electrification of Heavy Duty Transports.

**Hydrogen Alternative Focus**

Nikola revealed its lack of technological breakthrough when it was revealed that General Motors had the intention to market a Hydrogen trucks with the Nikola brand and...... GM Fuel Cells!! The drama related to the CEO trials made the rest. I am a huge fan of hydrogen , but as Cummins $CMI CEO confirmed, hydrogen trucks have a long long way to go before being adopted on a large scale (please note that [Cummins acquired Hydrogenics in Sept. 2019](https://www.cummins.com/news/releases/2019/09/09/cummins-closes-its-acquisition-hydrogenics) (second global leader after $BLDP in hydrogen fuel cells). According to Cummins and others, in the next years electrolyzer segment will grow first. Note that the hydrogen fuel needed for hypothetical trucks on California's road would need green hydrogen, thus it will put more stress on the grid.. Even if it is not focused on the US, I recommend readers this report of David Fickling about global green hydrogen potential by 2050. 

[According to David Fickling](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/the-hydrogen-economys-time-is-approaching/2020/05/08/383b1a04-9191-11ea-9322-a29e75effc93_story.html), hydrogen could meet 24% of the world‚Äôs energy needs by 2050, but it would likely take 31‚Äô320 TWh of electricity to hit this level. Last year, the entire world generated just roughly 26‚Äô000 TWh, of which 10‚Äô000 were coming from zero-carbon sources. By 2050 it may be achievable, but there are shorter deadlines for the transport sector. Actions today are required to match 2025 and 2030 emission targets.

If we want a high percentage of **green hydrogen**, a huge amount of grid investments is required today; high-tension grid infrastructure needs 5-10 years to be completed, therefore it is reasonable to say that hydrogen will be a sound reality for mobility from the late 2020‚Äôs on, not earlier. In addition, the potential of exhausted salt mines that could store hydrogen for months is just theoretical for now.

It is worth to remember that the sources for electricity generation in Europe are diversified and are not ready for a 100% renewable energy scenario:

* **Germany renounced to nuclear power** in 2011 and will renounce to coal by 2030, and the country is massively investing in gas pipelines, so it is very likely that it will not renounce to Russian gas.
* **France relies heavily on nuclear power**, with some of these power plants being soon too old to remain active. Therefore, traditional gas generation will be a ¬†likely alternative to overcome this problem.
* **The UK closed all its coal power plants** but decided to keep open nuclear and gas facilities.
* **Italy** relies heavily on gas and does not have any nuclear power plant.

None of Europe‚Äôs largest countries can afford a 100% green electricity sector that can satisfy both current demand plus the incremental demand coming from the green hydrogen sector. Therefore, some fossil fuel (natural gas) and nuclear plants are here to stay for the longer term.

**BLUE HYDROGEN CANNOT BE IGNORED -** The argument is different if we include in the discussion blue hydrogen along with carbon capture. In this scenario, we would need massive incentives and research investments in carbon capture technology, which now are still at an early stage. According to the European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen, [who spoke at the World Economic Forum in January 2020](https://www.ft.com/content/c93694c8-3d15-11ea-a01a-bae547046735), the EU will define the structure of a continental carbon tax by the end of this year (pre-COVID-19 intention, very likely now that the details will be published in 2021). For this reason, large trade partners like the US and China were advised to start their own studies on the tax, if they do not want their goods to be taxed at the highest possible carbon emission rate.

**HYDROGEN TRAIN FOCUS**¬†\- An interesting case in this regard is the Hydrogen train developed by Alstom and Hydrogenics (now Cummins Inc.) whose adoption has been delayed considerably. Alstom was able to sell its innovative product to some German and French regions. Nevertheless, in most of the cases hydrogen will come from fossil sources (Rhyne region etc.), with cleaner alternatives being provided at a later stage. In the region of Schleswig Holstein, where the green potential was massive, Alstom could have got the greatest commercial order for a hydrogen product worldwide; however, the green fueling station was at the heart of a controversy between the company and the tender offer authorities of Schleswig-Holstein. For this reason, 52 trains were allocated to the battery train manufacturer and the Alstom (Hydrogenics) & NEL consortium lost the tender offer. The proposed fueling station was massive for the time, being around 20 MW capacity, [but the cost of it was at the expense of the consortium](https://www.ln-online.de/Lokales/Lauenburg/Aus-fuer-die-Wasserstoffzelle-auf-der-Schiene).

**BEV Infrastructure focus**

Tesla instead kept postponing the launch of its Tesla SEMI. You can read again the last conference call transcripts which clearly states that the biggest issue from a product perspective is the fast charger technology, whose time of realization and commercialization is yet unknown. From a macro perspective instead is unclear how California may afford to charge thousands of Tesla SEMI with its current electricity grid.

**How does $CLNE fits into all this?**

 If you look at 2020 Q2 CC of $CLNE , management made a quite useful comparison for H2 fueling stations and BEV charging stations for heavy-duty. They told the story of a recharging facility in Los Angeles that was going to be built for $5.5 million to recharge 24 heavy-duty trucks in a day‚Äôs time, in like 20-hour time, using the equivalent of the electricity needed for 44‚Äô000 homes (!!!). Thus, it is reasonable to expect not many fleet operators to switch soon to BEV trucks.¬†

About hydrogen refueling, management commented on the experience they got operating a hydrogen station in California with on-site hydrogen generation through electrolysis:

‚Äú*Get a load of this, it requires about 20 gallons of water (each gallon is 3.785 liters) for every gallon of hydrogen you produce. So march that out on a nationwide scale. And the idea that we're going to do it with renewable sources at a station is going to be very daunting, okay?*

*I think that as you look at commercial truck stops with hydrogen, you're probably looking at something on the order of $15 million to $20 million, or more, per station. So this is a very expensive proposition because you're basically creating a whole new network. And really, the most successful stations around the world, and there's only a handful of hydrogen, is you're reforming natural gas.‚Äù*

It is clear why some fleet operators are switching to Natural Gas Trucks. Amazon in February and the Port of LA recently, with the decision to equate BEV and other Zero Emission trucks to the Natural Gas ones. 

**US Congress ""Californification"" , not so fast**

In the past legislative period, there were some bipartisan attempts to support RNG and Natural Gas mobility. US Congress has indeed shown some interest in the subject. Last June, a bipartisan effort was introduced in both the chambers of the US congress. The bill is called ‚Äú[Growing Climate Solutions Act](https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/09/10/growing-climate-solutions-act-gives-farmers-a-seat-at-the-carbon-market-table/)‚Äù and would allow farmers to generate revenue streams from different forms of carbon capture. Most notably, methane from livestock is mentioned in the legislation. If enacted at ¬†the federal level, decarbonized gas would receive a renovated interest from many different stakeholders. [Being a bipartisan deal](https://www.audubon.org/news/indiana-senator-mike-braun-discusses-bipartisan-climate-solutions-young-leaders), as farmers represent a prized electoral category, it should be enacted regardless of the next election results.

President Biden needs to show to his party and the American people that he is doing something about the environment. That is why he advertised the Ford BEV pickup and keeps saying that government's fleets will be electrified. As always, the political reality is much more complex than the headline announcements, and RNG has a lot of room to grow in this space. 

[Already in 2020, RNG represented 53% of all Natural Gas used in transport in the USA](https://bioenergyinternational.com/markets-finance/rng-surpassed-ng-accounting-for-53-percent-of-us-on-road-ngv-fuel-use-in-2020) . As noted in a previous DD, in California RNG is 90% of NG used in transport.

Let me know if you have further questions!

Holy shit, it now costs 116% to short CLOV. For those that don‚Äôt know, CLOV is a healthcare company with limited shares available to trade because insiders can‚Äôt sell until the stock trades at $30 for a 90 day period. What‚Äôs interesting is that short sellers shorted the stock >40% and now they have to fight with retail for the remaining stock to cover their shorts. But here‚Äôs the problem, they haven‚Äôt covered their shorts yet, the stock is up 100% and as you can see from the borrow fee, some are probably close to a margin call. They are scared shitless because this thing can go parabolic. I‚Äôm talking $50-100 a share! 

So what are shorts doing today? They predictably tried to crash the stock in the morning by shorting (selling borrowed shares) and that coincided with day traders taking profit. A pretty predictable tactic that is designed to scare retail into selling. Don‚Äôt let them fool you. This stock still has plenty of gas left, with an option chain up to $43 now!

Edit: Fuck off with the ü§°ü§°ü§° posts, it won‚Äôt save your favourite ticket and/or it won‚Äôt help you with your short position.

After market update: 

Well today was wild. What we saw was a combination of short sellers fighting back, probably some profit taking and perhaps a gamma ramp down. But the facts of the stock still remain the same. The stock is:

- Shorted by more than 40%
- More than 15% of the float is locked up with insiders WHO cannot sell
- Shorts are now even more underwater with crazy high borrow rates on their new shorted shares 

When people talk about the VW squeeze. There‚Äôs always a period before the spike where the stock dips. That dip was today. Now it remains on longs to keep pushing and we‚Äôre going to really benefit from a bigger option chain and another gamma ramp upwards.

Look, I won't lie, making money investing is not easy -- lots of smart people are trying to do the same thing. But the real challenge is having the emotional resilience to stick with your thesis, and while not easy, if you stick to basic math and only invest in what you know, it is simple. 

As retail investors, we have a huge advantage over the big guys on Wall Street who need to hug the benchmarks, satisfy investor demands for quarterly results and invest only where they can expect to generate acceptable ""risk-adjusted"" returns where risk is bizarrely defined as ""volatility"", instead of permanent impairment of capital, which is how I see it. 

We can arbitrage these structural weaknesses in institutional portfolio management by making contrarian bets on stocks that are currently out of favor with the big guys, provided we've done our homework on the business and believe that it is undervalued. Eventually, if we are right about the trajectory of the business, they will eventually be forced to buy us out at a huge premium when the results prove out and herd mentality kicks back in the other way. 

I've made a nice chunk of coin on several positions over the last few years, which has enabled me to make bigger investments, and I am currently up materially on my latest portfolio positions. These are positions I have held for long time periods, with Bed Bath and Beyond being the largest position, the longest held and highest percentage gains. In my view, it also has the most upside, so I want to share a bit more with you about my thesis.

**Nothing I've said or am about to say should be construed in any way as investment advice.** **This is just me sharing my YOLO, with an explanation for my thesis.** 

Bed Bath and Beyond was a successful business when it first arrived on the scene, practically creating and defining the concept of Big Box Retail. As so often happens in life, their huge initial success bred complacency, and the co-founders (Warren Eisenberg and Leonard Feinstein) who continued presiding over the Board basically ran the company like it was their private piggy bank, without regard for small (or even large) shareholders. 

Under the leadership of Steven Temares, the CEO they handpicked, the business failed to innovate and keep up with basic changes taking place in retail -- such as the rise of e-commerce. BBBY began to see online giants like Amazon and even brick & mortar mass merchants like Target and Lowes begin to eat their lunch. Steven Temares, along with the rest of the c-suite, continued to receive huge salaries and bonuses, while the two co-founders received generous perks like personal black-car chauffer services, all paid for by the company -- and therefore, shareholders. 

They also refused to answer basic questions posited by Wall Street research analysts on earnings calls, seeing the investment community essentially as a nuisance to be tolerated but not proxies for the true owners of the business -- public investors. 

Well, the situation got so bad that finally, circa mid-2019 in the year of our chimp lord, a trifecta of activist investors led by Legion Partners (founder was trained by legendary activist Nelson Peltz) and John Duskin at Macellum Capital decided to wage war, buying up \~6% of the stock and filing a 170 white paper detailing all of the problems with how the company was being run and proposing to replace the entire Board of Directors and management team with its own slate of nominees. The presentation, which is phenomenal, is posted here:

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886158/000092189519001180/ex1dfan14a09050028_04262019.pdf

They went so far as to create a website for their campaign, [restorebedbath.com](https://restorebedbath.com/), which they eventually dismantled after reaching a cooperation and settlement agreement with the Board of Directors. This agreement effectively ceded control to the activists, who proceeded to replace everyone. It was a real Red Wedding style bloodbath... I mean total scorched earth policy... no respect for life. While it's never pleasant seeing people get canned, these people deserved it. After years and years of unaccountable shareholder abuse, someone finally came along and pulled out the game cartridge, blew on it and hit ""reset"" on the console. And they saw that it was good. 

In November 2019 they announced Mark Tritton, legendary Chief Merchandising Officer from Target who was the main person responsible for their massive success in developing private label / owned brand programs, would be taking the helm as CEO. Since taking charge, Mark has consistently been executing on the playbook laid out by the activists in their white paper, which basically calls for making low risk / high return changes to bring Bed Bath and Beyond up to modern retailing standards using well established best practices. 

While some would argue that a turnaround of this magnitude carries high execution risk, I would disagree at this time for several reasons: (1) The changes they have been making are actually quite well established strategies for modern retailing, with loads of case studies to pull from (Best Buy, Target, Lowes, etc); (2) they have the best team you could ask for implementing these changes (i.e., Mark Tritton and John Hartmann, who became COO of BBBY after a highly successful run as CEO of True Value hardware chains); (3) their compensation is heavily geared towards stock compensation, so **they only win if we all win;** and (4) most of the highest risk action plans, like divesting of non-core assets, culling unproductive / unprofitable stores, reducing bloated headcount and liquidating stale inventories at reasonable valuations, are all in the rear-view mirror. 

As of June 2021, Bed Bath and Beyond is at an inflection point with a strong focus on driving profitable growth from its core business lines. This comes down to a few very important strategies: (1) focusing on digital first, omni-always capabilities (leading with the website and mobile app but making sure they are able to serve customers however, whenever and wherever they want to shop -- think curbside pick-up, same-day delivery and buy-online pick-up in store aka BOPIS); (2) focusing on key destination categories where the company is seen as an authority in the home, driving preference for BBBY over other chains and even national brands by defining its key categories using data and developing owned brands to fill out their assortment in those areas (they have launched 6 so far this year, with another 4 expected by end of year -- ultimately they expect 30% of their sales to come from the brands they have created). This will help help them in multiple ways. First, the products are only going to be available at BBBY, so they are re-establishing their authority in the home and preference for BBBY as a brand and not just a venue to shop other manufacturers' products (this also means these items can't be bought online except for thru BBBY, so it is Amazon defense playbook 101). Second, these products have been strategically developed in areas where they had gaps in their assortment relative to the competitors they were losing share to. As mentioned above, development of these brands was informed by **data**, including detailed line reviews and purchasing data. Third, and final, these products are designed to cost and have very healthy margins that should improve the overall margin profile of the business as they are rolled out. This fireside chat with Mark Tritton from January 2021 explains it all far better than I can, and is well worth watching for curious apes: 

[https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/videos/a-fireside-chat-with-mark-tritton-president-and-ceo-of-bed-bath-and-beyond/](https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/videos/a-fireside-chat-with-mark-tritton-president-and-ceo-of-bed-bath-and-beyond/)

**So where does this all leave us today?**

The company has successfully implemented its digital first, omni-always capabilities, rolling out BOPIS, curbside pickup and same-day delivery (just signed up deals with Instacart & Doordash). Digital sales were up 86% in the most recent quarter and 99% in the Bed Bath banner (they also own Buy Buy Baby, which is the largest national baby retail chain in the US with the bankruptcy of Babies R US -- this alone makes BBBY an interesting investment with tons of hidden value).

For the first time in **years**, the company began posting positive same-store sales for the last 3 quarters under Mark Tritton (consistently comping up in the mid-single digits). This is a very positive sign of the changes taking place already. Same-store sales metrics are probably the most important data point for retailers, as it basically tells you if consumers think they have a good reason to exist. Quite frankly, it is an extraordinary achievement by Mark and his team that after years of declining same-store sales they are now positive for 3 consecutive quarters, and I don't think this has gotten enough attention.

They have also begun launching their new owned brands, with 6 already launched and another 4 or so on the way this year. These brands have a strong focus on their top 5 destination categories (bedding, bath, kitchen & food prep, indoor decor, and organization) -- I've personally purchased and used these products, and they are excellent quality at reasonable price points. I think they will do great.

They are repurchasing $1bn of their own stock (at least $375mm completed so far at an average price of \~$23 per share, reducing their share count from \~126mm to \~109mm.

Normalizing their revenues for divested brands and culling of unprofitable / lowest productivity stores in their footprint, management has guided to \~$8.2bn of sales and $525mm of EBITDA **this year,** with sales comping up in the low- to mid-single digits range for the next several years and EBITDA margins improving to high single digits / low double digits resulting in EBITDA of $850mm-$1bn by YE 2023.

Applying simple mathematics and established standards of value, I believe the evidence shows that businesses in this industry (big box and specialty retail) would typically be valued at \~8-12x EBITDA which would imply an enterprise value (value of the whole business, not just the equity) of \~$9bn at the midpoint, which seems eminently reasonable for an iconic retailer under solid leadership with about 1000 stores and authority in key growing segments of the US economy.

Since they have virtually the same amount of cash as debt, the enterprise value should be about the same as the equity value, so \~$9bn at the midpoint above. With \~109mm shares outstanding today, that puts implied equity value per share at \~$82, but where it gets even more interesting is if you factor in the share buybacks. They've still got $625mm of remaining authorized share repurchases under their existing program, and depending on how cheap they are able to buy those shares they could materially reduce the share count further.

**So why are the big institutional investors continuing to ignore this stock? Why does everyone continue to ignore the insanely cheap valuation and upside potential under the extraordinary new leadership of Mark Tritton, John Hartmann and the rest of the new team?** 

I can think of several possibilities, but probably the main one is a backward looking bias, because the memory of the old management team and their awful performance dies hard. Their prolonged period of value destruction also gave rise to a narrative, parroted widely by thematic investors and talking heads on CNBC, basically a nonsense theory that all brick & mortar would die and the consumer would only ever want to shop at Amazon (somehow ignoring blatantly contradictory evidence provided by Target, Lowes, Walmart, etc). 

In this excellent interview with burgeoning hedge fund manager Dan McMurtrie (aka Supermugatu), he discusses the reality of how Amazon is killing bad retail, not all retail, and how certain investors / the media have taken the the idea way too far as they so often love to do. **I cannot recommend this highly enough -- well worth watching beginning at 39:45.**

[https://www.realvision.com/unmasking-supermugatu-how-the-pros-find-edge](https://www.realvision.com/unmasking-supermugatu-how-the-pros-find-edge)

It might take some time for BBBY to shake off the worries created during the former management team's tenure. Most of the time, the stock market is forward looking, but in this case investors have adopted a thesis that has them psychologically stuck in the past due to PTSD, and the distractions in rear-view mirror are blinding them to what is likely to happen in the next 6, 12, 18 months. 

Eventually, I personally expect BBBY to shock the market with positive results one of these quarters, forcing a rapid, seemingly unexpected valuation revision in the stock. They have already begun to put up excellent numbers, if you look at the underlying same-store sales, digital growth, growth in top 5 destination categories, for example. However, there has still been a lot of noise in the numbers from divestitures, culling of store footprint, COVID impact in 2020, etc., and it appears that perception has not caught up yet with the new reality.

While I haven't focused on it much here, the company also has an excellent balance sheet with over $1bn of cash, no meaningful near-term debt maturities, solidly positive free cash flow generation & very high short interest.

Even with all of the prevailing negative sentiment, this has been a profitable investment for me so far (I purchased heavily in periods where others abandoned hope over the last few years). In my opinion, the company is probably worth about $80 / share as of today, however with continued solid execution and more enthusiasm coming back into the name, I could see this valued well into the triple digits. 

So, even with my sizeable gains I haven't sold one share and don't plan to anytime soon. I am holding this baby to the end.",DD,0.72

The FED only has two options at the moment:

Raise rates to curb current inflation. This would cause the treasury to raise its coupon rates (bond interest), which would mean lower bond prices. This means the government has to pay higher interest, ultimately leaving the treasury no other option than defaulting on its obligations.

2. The FED doesnt raise rates, and lets inflation (and later hyperinflation) eat away at the dollar. This would also make the bonds worth less, as theyd have to lower the price to compensate for the interest being worth nothing. In this situation, the fed would be the only one willing to hold government bonds which would worsen the inflation as they effectively dont get payed interest on it.

Option one, the government goes bankrupt due to interests being to high to pay back. Option two, the public goes bankrupt due to hyperinflation.

Either way, a short position would profit in this trade.

Congratulations, and fuck me, right?

(Not a financial advice)

Starting from the basics. The first step in any technical analysis, should be to identify the current major trend, including both a short term and a longer term scales. Referring back to April 2020, and up to the first half of December 2020, the consolidation of a flat nature (with several expansions) is prevalent - in the price action diapason of $9.5 to 11 dollars as the upper resistance. As 2021 was approaching, during the last days of December, an extensive upward impulse took place, flirting with $14 resistance level. 
From the current perspective, that rapid price movement looks like a conventional bull trap, to get poor animals slaughtered fast and cruel. And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action.

The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it‚Äôs a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle‚Äôs tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal.

With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle‚Äôs opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price.

Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone.

Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary.

MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up.

TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

I hope, you‚Äôre happy now, u/memetron9000!

Cant change the title but because RKT has Class D and A shares they can‚Äôt be included as of 2017 implementations. However still useful info. It‚Äôs still not impossible either, rules can change and restructuring can happen. 

I do about 20 hours of research on the stock a week. I went straight to the filings and found the following information that makes RKT insanely Bullish play and investors wet dream. Not financial advice. 

The best part about this DD is that the news wasn‚Äôt shared to retail and kept quiet so you know it‚Äôs legitimate stuff. 

One of the requirements of being inducted into the SP 500 is having 10% of the company shares available to the free float. Right now it‚Äôs 7% and just recently grew at the end of May. Which I just found out.

https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/additional-material/sp-500-brochure.pdf


Here is the filing.. just happened. 

https://doc.morningstar.com/Document/045ec7d96db807790e6ffacc2db8cf35.msdoc/original?clientid=globaldocuments&amp;key=52dbc583e1012395

RKT was also just ranked 194 in the fortune 500 recently, and also ranked 5th in the best places to work by the Fortune 500. The company also makes billions of dollars a quarter and netted $2 billion in q1. 

One of the reasons why RKT is trading at its current price is because the float availability is so small. There is no other reason than that because you can‚Äôt be ranked the 194th richest company in America and have a market cap of less than $40 billion when the average company on the SP 500 is trading at an average PE ratio of 30 to 40. ARKT is sitting at four. Obviously it can be undervalued but it doesn‚Äôt make sense to anybody unless you read this post or do any research whatsoever. Not only that but they are continuing to grow and aggressively successful in doing so. 

Here‚Äôs the funny part and makes a ton of sense. If you look at the filing, Dan Gilbert sold his shares at $16.83 a share. Wonder why he would do that? Well if you read the filing you‚Äôll see that he is transferring his shares to class D shares which is used for employees and typically employees get a discount on a stock plan. Being that it‚Äôs one of the best places to work according to fortune 500 it‚Äôs reasonable to assume that they have a great benefits plan. Now the shares are sitting as class D shares waiting to be distributed either as gifts, awards, or acquired by employees through their stock purchase plan on a discount of current market price. He literally sold shares way below valuation to provide employees with amazing benefits. 

Funny part is now the stock is sitting around $20 a share. If the employee gets...I don‚Äôt know, a dollar discount. They now get it at 19. Selling at 16.83 gives Gilbert wiggle room when his employees purchase shares. This means it‚Äôs very unlikely the stock will ever fall below $18 again due to the fact that Gilbert will now possibly be taking a loss on the shares that he sold. He won‚Äôt have any shares below 16.83 available in his class D. So if an employee wants to purchase the stock at a discount and the stock sitting sitting at $17 there are no shares available to buy at 16‚Ä¶ Get my drift.?  Maybe this is another reason why he sold shares at 25 because he knew he needed to transfer shares lower and wanted his employees to accumulate at a very awesome price because the man is selfless.

Now... as far as the market goes investors know exactly that this is happening, trust me they have been around the block. They also now see how much a philanthropist the owner actually is and that they actually achieve the results that they speak of. You‚Äôre not one of the richest people in the world and don‚Äôt know how to work the market especially when you own a multi billion dollar mortgage company which frequently involved the market. 

This is amazing in so many ways because investors are not going to let retail buy below 18 for a very long time or ever and if they do you better load the F up. Once he transfers  remaining 3% needed to be in the S&amp;P 500 the stock will soar even higher, but I think there‚Äôs going to be investors pushing up the price at a premium prior to this happening. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll take any longer. I‚Äôm hoping that some stupid hedge fund associate read this post and tells his boss to gig is up so that it just happens already but maybe that‚Äôs wishful thinking.

Honestly if it gets inducted into the S&amp;P 500 and they actually achieve the results they want to achieve as they verbally stated in multiple earnings calls, 1k-2k a share is actually possible for a company ATH.
They have shown that they continue to grow and innovate at any cost.

My PT is $80 by November 2021. Pos 15k in  January 2023 calls. Looking to retire on this one. If you want something shorter there is a cup and handle for me on the daily chart with the gap to fill about 15% up from here. 

TLDR: RKT will eventually be inducted into spy as the owner continues to transfer class a shares to class D shares for employee plans. They were sold at 16.83 and I am assuming the reason is because the employees get the stock at a discounted price. This is just a theory but holy shit it makes a ton of fucking sense and I cannot wait to be a millionaire.

Edit: Also , I believe the buyback will only be initiated if it goes below 17 again. Then he probably will transfer shares at a higher price in which his employees will have no problem obtaining again at a discount.

Edit 2: please don‚Äôt talk about UWMC, you‚Äôre literally here because RKT put you on the board. Seriously, I don‚Äôt care how much Adderall I take I won‚Äôt waste anymore brain power on researching that stock. I know you‚Äôre going to anyway because I can‚Äôt get away from you cockroaches, but try not to if you can. Comparing the two is actually disrespectful. Come back to this post once they make it to the Fortune 500.

Edit 3: I was just informed on dual class structure which doesn‚Äôt allow for RKT into SPY. Unless there is a way around it. Companies like Google were grandfathered in. Fuck me eh. Regardless, a larger float and a the reason for the transfer of shares is still bullish. I would change the title if I could. Still useful info and also unlikely to see it below 17 for an extended period of time due to the fact the Dan sold shares at a 15% discount",DD,0.81
126,ASO,nq4abi,2021-06-01 22:51:51,"A forecasted potential earnings Breakdown for AMC, BB, &amp; ASO üòé from one dork to a bunch of retards","First things first, I hope you all understand that math is scientific, and these numbers will be pretty accurate but with all things finance sometimes assumptions must be made. The assumption being made here is that the stock market will react to AMC, BB, and ASO short squeezes EXACTLY as it did to GME. A true apples to apples comparison of what has happened to GME being applied to our other favorites.

Up first is teaching you how to calculate earning in the form of a percentage. The formula goes like this. (Current Value - initial Cost)√∑initial cost x 100= percentage return. 

GmE started at roughly 18$ before it gained squeeze worthy traction and eventually topped out at $483. I chose 18$ as the starting point t because earning up until that point were smooth and slowly trending upwards on a 1 year chart. GmE has 70 Million Shares outstanding. It's 18 to 483 dollars increase gives it a return of 2,583% roughly.

Applying this to AMC goes like this. AMC had a ""pre-surge"" stable price of 10$. 10x25.83=258$ however GME only has 15 percent of the shares outstanding that AMC has so you have to consider the market Cap. $258x.15%= $38.70 expected squeeze price. All variables being the same at its highest AMC could go to $38.70 

BB is going  to be very similar to AMC because of a large market cap. BB ""pre-surge"" stable price is $10 as well, this is being generous because a good argument could be made to use $8-9 but I decided to use 10. So 10x25.83=$258 however GME only has 12% of shares outstanding as BB so that has to be factored in 258x .12%= $30.96  I believe at the height of any BB squeeze due to market cap the price could soar as high as $30 using GME variables.

Here is where things get interesting ASO has a ""pre-surge"" stable price of $30 and GME has 77% of shares outstanding compared to ASO, a Much higher variable, with a much higher starting price, and a higher short interest than BB & AMC. Here we go 30x25.83= 775$ 
775 x.77= $596 squeeze price potential

So in essence we can triple our money or better on AMC & BB depending on when you bought in. AsO has the potential to be HUUUGGEüöÄüöÄüíØüòÉ",DD,0.78

Actually, AMC was my inspiration for looking deeper into the GME chart - it had/has a **fantastic setup**.

[AMC TA](https://preview.redd.it/gju8synduwz61.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=46c863adbb144c04e3327bb212a79bb1633608fc)

Broke a massive falling wedge on the daily chart with a great increase in volume. It's also a cup and handle dating back to January. There was even confluence with key resistance near the breakout point @ **11.58.**

**13.24** is key support now, keep an eye on that.

We have been coiling under key resistance for a few days (**14.53) THE SECOND THIS BREAKS, WE ARE CLEAR FOR TAKEOFF (AGAIN).** Also - note the way we are coiling upwards below key resistance is a very bullish data point. Volume is declining as we chop up.

Price targets are **17.25 & 20.36.**

This is the best setup I've seen in this stock since the initial squeeze. Remember, keep it simple.

***TL;DR -*** AMC actually looks good for once from an **unbiased** technical standpoint

Not Financial Advice

Edit: Only thing I forgot to mention was the upper trendline of the wedge extends back to that 17.25 high - this is just another data point that adds to the validity of the breakout.

What's more, Clover Health has no debt whatsoever with more than $700 million in cash. The company could use its massive liquidity to settle investigations -- without ever admitting any alleged wrongdoing.

For the full year, Clover Health expects to grow its Medicare Advantage patient count by 19.5% year over year to 69,000 (with superb growth coming from outside of New Jersey). The company also expects to have 200,000 Medicare beneficiaries through its new direct contracting program, compared to zero in the prior year.

Alright smooth brains. You might've seen this weird little ticker called CLNE picking up some steam around here and wondered why. Back in March/April there was a very solid DD done about why this company is poised to grow. Will post link in comments 

However there's been a couple of things that have happened since then that turned this from a solid play into a potential gamma squeeze based off OI that won't send us to the moon...but to Saturn!!! ü™ê ü™ê ü™ê

Amazon (yes that Amazon), made a deal with CLNE to fuel their trucks....and the best part? THEY ALSO AGREED TO HAVE THE OPTION TO BUY 50 MILLION SHARES (about 5%) AT $13.49 PER SHARE. EDIT: As /u/dazedstate pointed out I completely forgot to add that they ingeniously built their fuel stations next to Amazon warehouses. 

The stock has low daily trading volume. This allowed certain institutions to hammer it down and keep it there (You know which ones they are). But it's also very easy to push around. How easy? Nrdrage was able to send the price up $1 by himself for under 250K as a demonstration.

The Median PT is $20!!!! that's literally double what it is right now!


SO WHAT ABOUT THE GAMMA SQUEEZE?

Based off that DD the OI for June 16C's @13 has reached 25.22K!! This stock has low volume so 2.5 Million shares reaching ITM would send it shooting up even further. Okay but the average volume is 6M...how does 2.5 million in the money drive it up? Because there would be so much demand at one strike price that there wouldn't be enough stock available at that price which would result in HF's and IB's having to do sweep orders to make up for all the calls they sold.....for those of you with more than one wrinkle... that means the price would keep going up and up until they had enough shares to cover their calls!! And once it hit's that level there's so much momentum it'll keep sky rocketing!!

\> Trading at a forward P/E of 9.91.

\> Many whales already own a shit ton of shares, but many apes have not even heard of it yet.

\> Analyst buy recommendation (5 out of 7).

\> Dividend of $0.40, paid quarterly $0.10 (4.5% yield).

**There is definitely a possible (not guaranteed, but the ingredients are there) short squeeze:**

20.5% of the float is short. That‚Äôs just below SPœπE (24%), Q–Ö (23.8%), and VXR–¢ (21%) and higher than –ÖRNE (20.2%), SEN–Ö (20.4%) and AMœπ(19%).   The volume is slightly below the average for the last few months. But  all it needs is a smidge of momentum and this thing could explode. Look  at the break outs the rest of  them are having, and many of those  companies aren‚Äôt making any money.

**Which brings me to my next point: PROFITABILITY**

(TL;DR for apes: They are making so much money.)

EPS is up 592% this year, and 821% Q/Q. That‚Äôs insane. Forward P/E is 9.91. EV/EBITDA is 1.7, P/S is 2.48. Let‚Äôs compare these numbers to a peer, $OCN:

–ûCN‚Äôs EPS Q/Q is  36.7%, and the stock is up 17.71% in the quarter. UWMœπ‚Äôs EPS Q/Q is up 821% and the stock is only up 1.37%. Any guesses why? *–ûCN‚Äôs short float is only 1.24%****.*** *UWMœπ‚Äôs is 20%*. Hmm....

**$300M Share Buyback**

May Q1 Earnings Quote: ‚ÄúAs you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of   $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I   always¬†explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special dividend or a share buyback program. As you guys have seen, we¬†concluded share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward shareholders. We announced the authorization of $300 million share buyback over the next 24 months. And¬†quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that.‚Äù

**Dividend**

Remember, ‚ÄúIt costs nothing for me to hold, but it costs them to short?‚Äù Well on this one, you actually *get paid to hold*. **4.5% per year** at the current price. And would you look at that, we‚Äôve got a quarterly dividend ex-date coming up on June 9th, $0.10/share.

**Insider buying**

One insider, Robert Verdun (director), dropped half a million on shares at  $7.87. Insiders sell for many reasons, but there‚Äôs only one reason they buy. And we‚Äôre not far above his purchase price right now. The CEO, Mat Ishbia, has committed to not selling his shares anytime in the near future as well.

The reason why there will be a lot of money made against short sellers this year is due to what the actual outcome of this battle means.  The battle is who gets to control the narrative in the market.  That's far more valuable than the actual fundamentals in any of these investments.  The value of both these stocks now balances on the fact they are ""battleground stocks.""

AMC and GME were slated to be windfalls for short sellers and predatory investors.  Major Hedge Funds keep taking stupid losses on these stocks because they need to be right.  If they aren't right then the narrative is broken.  So they can't continue a cycle of targeting stocks they want to crash and profiting off the panic they generate.  If retail dictates the narrative then being able to short sell a stock down to nothing becomes a lot harder.  Analysts actually have to study companies intensively and follow market sentiment rather than justifying their sentiment and engineering the falling share price.

So yeah I would hold forever.  Because maybe you FOMO this time around and end up holding the bag.  But we have seen several spikes this year, so next go around you find yourself profiting.  We have seen multiple billion dollar losses reported by hedge funds.  It's easy to suggest that these funds are coming back in to closely watched stocks, trying to short and getting caught.  So we see squeezes and general excitement over serious money being on the wrong side of these stocks.

So not a financial adviser, just a retard.  But yeah I'd hang in, buy during dips and hold until you're happy to profit.  We are going to see AMC and GME fought over all year because the precious narrative is at stake.",Discussion,0.85

After Friday's action, the conclusion is no, but let's look at the chart and see what's going on.

What happened on Friday:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x2wmukqxbp371.png?width=1916&format=png&auto=webp&s=01459ffc0e98d47ef446f563fcf853f0fff36af1

The first real red day in 2 weeks lost support at the $14.50 USD mark but also had reduced volume. Can't win them all. We should consider this pullback extremely healthy and does not interfere with the overall bull trend as we were exceeding the Bollinger bands for 5 straight trading days. Exceeding the Bollinger bands is considered to be a strong indicator of volatility, and I strongly believe we have more volatility to come. I would also assume traders were taking their anywhere from 60%-100% profits off the table.

We did not bounce back up to the $24-$33 range as I expected on Friday, but again opinions are like assholes. Everyone has one. I believe that range is easily accessible still through this coming trading week.

Signs that make me bearish:  
\-1D chart RSI is still quite high but is reaching back into a healthy range.  
\-Lower volume Friday. But the overall market was low and red so I'm not too concerned.  
\-Gap to be filled on the chart. \~$11.56-12.30. Usually, gaps do get filled on charts but not always in the short term.  
\-Loss of the 14.50 support. On the hourly chart we had a small bounce in that range on Thursday after the massive opening and slightly recovered, a bounce again just after open on Friday but ultimately failed for the rest of the day. This is a volume issue and many taking profits/losses trying to swing trade.  
\-Possibility of reaching $12.10, if that fails next stop is probably \~$11.30

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nvjhe4fybp371.png?width=1811&format=png&auto=webp&s=817de62d8aedc2eacb1a9bcbbb5e3ac73bf1a80e

These are the bearish signals that I can find and are important to note but again the overall bull trend still exists on a daily, and when in doubt zoom out is the motto. One bad day does not mean you have a bad life.

Signs that make me bullish:  
\-We ended the day inside the top end of the Bollinger bands and they appear to not be contracting yet on the daily chart.  
\-20 DMA and 50DMA have just crossed. This is called a golden cross and the 200DMA is now beginning to slope upwards.  
\-Large amount of strength in the $13.00 range. If you look back at the hourly chart above where we ended Friday you can see where it is flat in comparison to on Wednesday. This shows strong support in this range and will be a powerful foundation to build a cup and handle formation. This range was also significant in the previous run in January

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qj063yzybp371.png?width=1868&format=png&auto=webp&s=703841beac1005b97a1849c19ddc18187fee799f

\-Still a large following and people interested in $BB this weekend across forums, subreddits, and media. #1 ticker on WSB Thursday and Friday.  
\-Largest open interest of stock options is $20 USD.  
\-Put/call ratio still relatively low  
\-Small short shares available (Squeeze is in the realm of possibilities again)  
\-RSI looks healthy on the hourly for a dead cat bounce at open  
\-Currently, one of the best plays technically speaking but also fundamentally for the long term (1-2 years+).  
\-I have confirmation bias because cybersecurity is a massive growth market. If you didn't hear, JBS is the world's largest supplier of beef, and got hacked might actually cause a shortage of beef in the supermarkets or a large squeeze in beef prices. Go long on beef and cybersecurity.  
\-Institutions are still accumulating. Remember, around 48% of BB is owned by institutions and insiders. This is massive. One of the largest companies with large institutional ownership is Microsoft at \~70% or Facebook with an %80. We aren't that far off with a much much lower share count.

If the share price goes down significantly tomorrow I'll post another update, only because if the share price goes down with such a small amount of short shares available I believe this will only be tightening the slingshot further that would rocket $BB's share price to the $30s.

Things that we need to continue to look for:  
\-High volume  
\-Amount of posts and articles about $BB on Reddit, commercial websites, and other forums  
\-News or statements from $BB. One piece of news that's significant could be the catalyst to a moonshot.

158,CLOV,nty1bd,2021-06-07 00:59:58,CLOV - Big Daddy of All Squeezes DD,"**UPDATE 6/08/2021: The squeeze has not happened yet, CLOV is set up nicely for both massive short squeeze and gamma squeeze. Not a single share has been covered, in fact there were more borrows this week (yes Hedges are shameless). I also want to emphasize on the lock up period for CLOV. The insiders cannot sell a single class B shares until the price is $30 for at least 90 consecutive days and have 700 million in cash so no need to fear any insider dumping/dilution like other companies. I have not sold any shares. I expect a much much bigger return for my investment**

I want to start off by saying this is not a post comparing CLOV to GME or AMC. While these stocks have some similarities, particularly being targeted by hedge funds for short squeezes, I‚Äôm not going to get into that. This post is for anyone who is somewhat new to investing, still learning about shorts and squeezes, and those of you who are more knowledgeable but want the full picture of what‚Äôs going on with this stock. You can also think of this post as a Part 2 to [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CLOV/comments/ngesez/this_is_the_bottom_and_youll_be_top_of_the_world/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Brief description of my last post - it was about the stock reaching its bottom at $6.80 and only going up from there (which was correct).

**TL;DR - Currently, the highest number of options purchased have a strike price between $7-18 for every single month. The goal is to stay above $12 to create a snowball of options being executed, thereby causing a gamma squeeze - the higher the strike price, the higher the limit to execute and the hedges are worse off.**

**What Is Clover Health?**

Clover Health is not just another insurance company. They have combined Medicare insurance services with new patient-centered technology aimed at facilitating the ease and effectiveness of diagnosis, treatment, and most importantly, prevention. This company should not be classified as a health insurance company, but a tech company. Their AI learning and database, Clover Assistant, make it easier for providers to eliminate unnecessary and repetitive lab testing, repetitive diagnoses, and it consolidates a patient‚Äôs medical history into one platform. This not only saves the patient headaches from navigating our decentralized healthcare system, but it also saves both patients and insurance companies an enormous amount of money by avoiding duplicated efforts. 

Currently, CLOV covers 66,300 customers across 8 states out of the 61,212,247 Medicare beneficiaries nationwide, which equates to .0011% of the beneficiary population. As you can tell, this number is extremely low, which makes sense since they are a brand new company. When they reach even 1% of the beneficiaries, this company‚Äôs stock price would be $100+ based on fundamentals alone. But I expect these numbers to skyrocket as they gain more members and their AI learning database improves more and more.

[CLOV Medicare Advantage Plan by &#37; of growth compared to competitors \(cloverhealth.com\)](https://preview.redd.it/wuoalim07q371.png?width=3297&format=png&auto=webp&s=b38cba4adeb4fcbbeae5d53ea93751964480113a)

CLOV has huge long-term growth potential, so the risk to reward is extremely favorable towards getting into the squeeze. Let me explain why.

**Positive Catalysts**

All the negative catalysts are out of the way and everything is priced in. Here are some positives I‚Äôm keeping an eye on: 

* DOJ/SEC case dropping or settling (even if CLOV is found guilty of taking advantage of Medicare, it will still be positive because at max they‚Äôll pay a fine and that‚Äôll be over with). I highly doubt CLOV will be found guilty though because the Hindenburg claims are rather baseless and the DOJ were forced to inquire about this only because it‚Äôs related to Medicare. 
* Biden‚Äôs health care proposal reducing the Medicare qualifying age below 65 would create millions of new beneficiaries. The hype around the proposal alone will create a huge stock price increase in all healthcare-related stocks, so CLOV will definitely benefit.
* CLOV is officially added to the Russell 3000, who will have to purchase a ton of CLOV shares.
* PR of any new partnership, expanding to further states, and increasing current partnerships. They‚Äôre growing rapidly as is, so news like this is bound to come out in the near future.

**The Dark Clouds Surrounding CLOV**

* As previously mentioned, the DOJ inquiry is still lingering and it‚Äôs unclear when it will be settled. Although it‚Äôs priced in, it is still something to watch out for.
* Hindenturd‚Äôs constant attacks despite insisting they don‚Äôt have any positions. Why would Hindenburg attack Chamath Palihapitiya even though they aren‚Äôt benefiting from it, according to themselves? This relates to the GME/AMC squeeze; Chamath was a big proponent of the push against the hedges. He was outspoken about the squeeze on several occasions and gave GME his validation, which in turn hurt Citadel and other hedges shorting GME immensely. Hindenburg‚Äôs report was created to hurt all of Chamath‚Äôs IPOs, especially CLOV. Basically, this is retaliation against Chamath for standing with the retail investors, and if I had to take a wild guess, Citadel has paid Hindenburg to write this baseless report. I‚Äôve added a link at the bottom of this post about the Hindenburg allegations and the counter from CLOV for those who were not aware of all the allegations. (PS - Despite all the negative press surrounding Chamath, his track record is stellar.)
* The constant manipulation by short sellers to create negative incentive. For instance, the fake lawsuits by Lifshitz that are shady at best; if you go to their website, you‚Äôll find the phone number listed goes straight to voicemail. All their social media lead to Wix.com platforms instead of their own. And, **THEIR PHYSICAL LOCATION DOES NOT EXIST** as shown in Google Maps. Lots of red flags.

**Let‚Äôs get down to the nitty gritty - The Daddy of all Short Squeezes**

CLOV is currently over 42.58% as of Friday, making it the highest shorted stock on paper (and it‚Äôs unclear how many naked shorts there are, which could easily be 70-100%+; it‚Äôs impossible to know since those shares are shorted illegally). THE SQUEEZE IS INEVITABLE, it‚Äôs just a matter of how much more the short interest increases, which will correlate to a bigger squeeze. Furthermore, the borrowed interest on CLOV stock has more than doubled to 3.7%, meaning those who are shorting have to pay much higher interest on borrowing the stocks, and that number will only continue to increase as demand increases. Soon, they won‚Äôt be able to borrow anymore stocks and will have to short it naked in order to suppress the price further, essentially digging a gargantuan hole in which to bury themselves.

[CLOV S\/I&#37; as reported by Ortex](https://preview.redd.it/yem0laz57q371.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0602994d6bc0ddc1305c2737a8b1d70de3f7c58)

No need to fear the company dumping their shares or diluting it because the Class B shares are locked up - the directors aren‚Äôt able to sell any shares until the stock price stays above $30 for 90 consecutive days or more. The company is $700 million cash flow positive and no debt, therefore there won‚Äôt be any dilution.

The P/S ratio is considered a particularly good metric for evaluating young, potentially high growth companies or companies in cyclical industries that may not show an actual net profit every year. Let‚Äôs talk about CLOV‚Äôs P/S ratio for a moment. 

CLOV‚Äôs 2020 revenue was $672.9 million compared to $462.3 million in 2019, which puts it at 45.6% increase in growth. They beat their own expectations and those of analysts by a wide margin. In 2018 and 2019, the market valued tech companies with IPOs at an average of 11.7 and 10.4 times (respectively) their previous 12 month earnings. Conservatively, that would put CLOV at $7 billion market cap, which is around $20+ fair value. But in 2020, that number doubled, which would increase CLOV‚Äôs market cap significantly. However, for this consideration, I‚Äôm using the 2018/19 valuation to be conservative.

**Bottom Line**

The fair value of CLOV is anywhere from $20-30 fundamentally, which makes it a very risk-free, undervalued stock that has been suppressed by short sellers. But this post is not about the fundamentals - this is about exposing the short sellers‚Äô manipulation of CLOV. On paper, this company is shorted 42.58% (though this is MUCH higher when you include the illegal naked shorts that aren‚Äôt reported), making it the highest shorted stock as of Friday. This number could go much higher as short sellers continue to borrow stocks and suppress the price further, which only hurts them more the longer this is shorted. As is common knowledge from previous squeezes, hedge funds are not going to cover anytime soon; they have to be forced by triggering their margins. As the Fed hinted recently, hedge funds are the most leveraged they‚Äôve ever been in the last 20 years, which means retail investors can take advantage of them just like they‚Äôve been taking advantage of retail investors for 100s of years.

I don‚Äôt know how much it could squeeze, from $50-150 or much higher, and there‚Äôs no telling where the ceiling will end up. The squeeze is inevitable, whether you or I buy it or not, but the process of how long it will take is up to the retail investing community.

Ok apes, chimps, gorillas, primates of all stripes... I'm going to level with you. I am posting this mainly because I want to throw one of my best ideas into the ring. But that's not the only reason I am writing this. I also want to inspire those of you who are just getting started in this game. For those who say that retail investors can't consistently make money in markets, I present you with some recent gain porn for your viewing pleasure. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gyvyzp0yln371.png?width=1355&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf56089ae7e9cff017cacdc546e9aa3c9e55f329

Look, I won't lie, making money investing is not easy -- lots of smart people are trying to do the same thing. But the real challenge is having the emotional resilience to stick with your thesis, and while not easy, if you stick to basic math and only invest in what you know, it is simple. 

As retail investors, we have a huge advantage over the big guys on Wall Street who need to hug the benchmarks, satisfy investor demands for quarterly results and invest only where they can expect to generate acceptable ""risk-adjusted"" returns where risk is bizarrely defined as ""volatility"", instead of permanent impairment of capital, which is how I see it. 

We can arbitrage these structural weaknesses in institutional portfolio management by making contrarian bets on stocks that are currently out of favor with the big guys, provided we've done our homework on the business and believe that it is undervalued. Eventually, if we are right about the trajectory of the business, they will eventually be forced to buy us out at a huge premium when the results prove out and herd mentality kicks back in the other way. 

I've made a nice chunk of coin on several positions over the last few years, which has enabled me to make bigger investments, and I am currently up materially on my latest portfolio positions. These are positions I have held for long time periods, with Bed Bath and Beyond being the largest position, the longest held and highest percentage gains. In my view, it also has the most upside, so I want to share a bit more with you about my thesis.

**Nothing I've said or am about to say should be construed in any way as investment advice.** **This is just me sharing my YOLO, with an explanation for my thesis.** 

Bed Bath and Beyond was a successful business when it first arrived on the scene, practically creating and defining the concept of Big Box Retail. As so often happens in life, their huge initial success bred complacency, and the co-founders (Warren Eisenberg and Leonard Feinstein) who continued presiding over the Board basically ran the company like it was their private piggy bank, without regard for small (or even large) shareholders. 

Under the leadership of Steven Temares, the CEO they handpicked, the business failed to innovate and keep up with basic changes taking place in retail -- such as the rise of e-commerce. BBBY began to see online giants like Amazon and even brick & mortar mass merchants like Target and Lowes begin to eat their lunch. Steven Temares, along with the rest of the c-suite, continued to receive huge salaries and bonuses, while the two co-founders received generous perks like personal black-car chauffer services, all paid for by the company -- and therefore, shareholders. 

They also refused to answer basic questions posited by Wall Street research analysts on earnings calls, seeing the investment community essentially as a nuisance to be tolerated but not proxies for the true owners of the business -- public investors. 

Well, the situation got so bad that finally, circa mid-2019 in the year of our chimp lord, a trifecta of activist investors led by Legion Partners (founder was trained by legendary activist Nelson Peltz) and John Duskin at Macellum Capital decided to wage war, buying up \~6% of the stock and filing a 170 white paper detailing all of the problems with how the company was being run and proposing to replace the entire Board of Directors and management team with its own slate of nominees. The presentation, which is phenomenal, is posted here:

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886158/000092189519001180/ex1dfan14a09050028_04262019.pdf

They went so far as to create a website for their campaign, [restorebedbath.com](https://restorebedbath.com/), which they eventually dismantled after reaching a cooperation and settlement agreement with the Board of Directors. This agreement effectively ceded control to the activists, who proceeded to replace everyone. It was a real Red Wedding style bloodbath... I mean total scorched earth policy... no respect for life. While it's never pleasant seeing people get canned, these people deserved it. After years and years of unaccountable shareholder abuse, someone finally came along and pulled out the game cartridge, blew on it and hit ""reset"" on the console. And they saw that it was good. 

In November 2019 they announced Mark Tritton, legendary Chief Merchandising Officer from Target who was the main person responsible for their massive success in developing private label / owned brand programs, would be taking the helm as CEO. Since taking charge, Mark has consistently been executing on the playbook laid out by the activists in their white paper, which basically calls for making low risk / high return changes to bring Bed Bath and Beyond up to modern retailing standards using well established best practices. 

While some would argue that a turnaround of this magnitude carries high execution risk, I would disagree at this time for several reasons: (1) The changes they have been making are actually quite well established strategies for modern retailing, with loads of case studies to pull from (Best Buy, Target, Lowes, etc); (2) they have the best team you could ask for implementing these changes (i.e., Mark Tritton and John Hartmann, who became COO of BBBY after a highly successful run as CEO of True Value hardware chains); (3) their compensation is heavily geared towards stock compensation, so **they only win if we all win;** and (4) most of the highest risk action plans, like divesting of non-core assets, culling unproductive / unprofitable stores, reducing bloated headcount and liquidating stale inventories at reasonable valuations, are all in the rear-view mirror. 

As of June 2021, Bed Bath and Beyond is at an inflection point with a strong focus on driving profitable growth from its core business lines. This comes down to a few very important strategies: (1) focusing on digital first, omni-always capabilities (leading with the website and mobile app but making sure they are able to serve customers however, whenever and wherever they want to shop -- think curbside pick-up, same-day delivery and buy-online pick-up in store aka BOPIS); (2) focusing on key destination categories where the company is seen as an authority in the home, driving preference for BBBY over other chains and even national brands by defining its key categories using data and developing owned brands to fill out their assortment in those areas (they have launched 6 so far this year, with another 4 expected by end of year -- ultimately they expect 30% of their sales to come from the brands they have created). This will help help them in multiple ways. First, the products are only going to be available at BBBY, so they are re-establishing their authority in the home and preference for BBBY as a brand and not just a venue to shop other manufacturers' products (this also means these items can't be bought online except for thru BBBY, so it is Amazon defense playbook 101). Second, these products have been strategically developed in areas where they had gaps in their assortment relative to the competitors they were losing share to. As mentioned above, development of these brands was informed by **data**, including detailed line reviews and purchasing data. Third, and final, these products are designed to cost and have very healthy margins that should improve the overall margin profile of the business as they are rolled out. This fireside chat with Mark Tritton from January 2021 explains it all far better than I can, and is well worth watching for curious apes: 

[https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/videos/a-fireside-chat-with-mark-tritton-president-and-ceo-of-bed-bath-and-beyond/](https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/videos/a-fireside-chat-with-mark-tritton-president-and-ceo-of-bed-bath-and-beyond/)

**So where does this all leave us today?**

The company has successfully implemented its digital first, omni-always capabilities, rolling out BOPIS, curbside pickup and same-day delivery (just signed up deals with Instacart & Doordash). Digital sales were up 86% in the most recent quarter and 99% in the Bed Bath banner (they also own Buy Buy Baby, which is the largest national baby retail chain in the US with the bankruptcy of Babies R US -- this alone makes BBBY an interesting investment with tons of hidden value).

For the first time in **years**, the company began posting positive same-store sales for the last 3 quarters under Mark Tritton (consistently comping up in the mid-single digits). This is a very positive sign of the changes taking place already. Same-store sales metrics are probably the most important data point for retailers, as it basically tells you if consumers think they have a good reason to exist. Quite frankly, it is an extraordinary achievement by Mark and his team that after years of declining same-store sales they are now positive for 3 consecutive quarters, and I don't think this has gotten enough attention.

They have also begun launching their new owned brands, with 6 already launched and another 4 or so on the way this year. These brands have a strong focus on their top 5 destination categories (bedding, bath, kitchen & food prep, indoor decor, and organization) -- I've personally purchased and used these products, and they are excellent quality at reasonable price points. I think they will do great.

They are repurchasing $1bn of their own stock (at least $375mm completed so far at an average price of \~$23 per share, reducing their share count from \~126mm to \~109mm.

Normalizing their revenues for divested brands and culling of unprofitable / lowest productivity stores in their footprint, management has guided to \~$8.2bn of sales and $525mm of EBITDA **this year,** with sales comping up in the low- to mid-single digits range for the next several years and EBITDA margins improving to high single digits / low double digits resulting in EBITDA of $850mm-$1bn by YE 2023.

Applying simple mathematics and established standards of value, I believe the evidence shows that businesses in this industry (big box and specialty retail) would typically be valued at \~8-12x EBITDA which would imply an enterprise value (value of the whole business, not just the equity) of \~$9bn at the midpoint, which seems eminently reasonable for an iconic retailer under solid leadership with about 1000 stores and authority in key growing segments of the US economy.

Since they have virtually the same amount of cash as debt, the enterprise value should be about the same as the equity value, so \~$9bn at the midpoint above. With \~109mm shares outstanding today, that puts implied equity value per share at \~$82, but where it gets even more interesting is if you factor in the share buybacks. They've still got $625mm of remaining authorized share repurchases under their existing program, and depending on how cheap they are able to buy those shares they could materially reduce the share count further.

**So why are the big institutional investors continuing to ignore this stock? Why does everyone continue to ignore the insanely cheap valuation and upside potential under the extraordinary new leadership of Mark Tritton, John Hartmann and the rest of the new team?** 

I can think of several possibilities, but probably the main one is a backward looking bias, because the memory of the old management team and their awful performance dies hard. Their prolonged period of value destruction also gave rise to a narrative, parroted widely by thematic investors and talking heads on CNBC, basically a nonsense theory that all brick & mortar would die and the consumer would only ever want to shop at Amazon (somehow ignoring blatantly contradictory evidence provided by Target, Lowes, Walmart, etc). 

In this excellent interview with burgeoning hedge fund manager Dan McMurtrie (aka Supermugatu), he discusses the reality of how Amazon is killing bad retail, not all retail, and how certain investors / the media have taken the the idea way too far as they so often love to do. **I cannot recommend this highly enough -- well worth watching beginning at 39:45.**

[https://www.realvision.com/unmasking-supermugatu-how-the-pros-find-edge](https://www.realvision.com/unmasking-supermugatu-how-the-pros-find-edge)

It might take some time for BBBY to shake off the worries created during the former management team's tenure. Most of the time, the stock market is forward looking, but in this case investors have adopted a thesis that has them psychologically stuck in the past due to PTSD, and the distractions in rear-view mirror are blinding them to what is likely to happen in the next 6, 12, 18 months. 

Eventually, I personally expect BBBY to shock the market with positive results one of these quarters, forcing a rapid, seemingly unexpected valuation revision in the stock. They have already begun to put up excellent numbers, if you look at the underlying same-store sales, digital growth, growth in top 5 destination categories, for example. However, there has still been a lot of noise in the numbers from divestitures, culling of store footprint, COVID impact in 2020, etc., and it appears that perception has not caught up yet with the new reality.

While I haven't focused on it much here, the company also has an excellent balance sheet with over $1bn of cash, no meaningful near-term debt maturities, solidly positive free cash flow generation & very high short interest.

Even with all of the prevailing negative sentiment, this has been a profitable investment for me so far (I purchased heavily in periods where others abandoned hope over the last few years). In my opinion, the company is probably worth about $80 / share as of today, however with continued solid execution and more enthusiasm coming back into the name, I could see this valued well into the triple digits. 

So, even with my sizeable gains I haven't sold one share and don't plan to anytime soon. I am holding this baby to the end.",DD,0.72

Have you ever bought anything only half retarded? üöÄ ASO DD üöÄ","# TL;DR - ASO has done nothing but   üöÄ  hard since IPO, and they'll continue to do so as they grow and realize their full valuation. A lot of upside to this stock.

^(Disclaimer: This is not financial advice, this is my opinion, do your own DD. Unlike my last post, this one will not mention ass to mouth, sorry. It took me three hours to write this because my mom would only release one of my arms from my chair restraints for fear of me buying more CLOV puts. As far as ASO goes..... I like the stock.)

Hello again WSB apes, cows, and palan-tards,

A lot of you have probably never heard of ASO (Academy Sports) because we all know you never leave the carboard castle your mom helped you build in the basement where you ""day trade"" (read: buy high sell low duh idiot). 

Academy Sports deals in all things outdoors. Guns, ammo, team sports stuff (no, larping in the park downtown doesn't count), apparel, shoes, etc... Notice I didn't say anything about video games, free popcorn, or leprechauns. We're talking about a whole different animal here. Academy is located mainly in the Southern United States and operates 250+ stores. In the year 2000 (ancient history for some of you autistic fucks) they had 35 stores. 

# ASO went public via IPO in October of 2020 at a price of $12 or some shit. Let's take a look at what it's done since then, starting with the first 6 months of it's life:

**WARNING: This next section contains some really retarded Travelcenters of America type of shit. Look at these extremely simplified charts may cause wrinkles, but is more likely to further smooth your brain; you're welcome.**

https://preview.redd.it/4iic0sbxi2471.png?width=1945&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f0f7188de3b4d176262467f811ecba409ae3c68

As you can see (or maybe you can't because it's so fucking small) ASO doubled  üöÄ in its first 6 months on the market. For you really smooth brains, that's about $12 or 100% of upward movement. Now let's take a look at the 2 months since then...

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dcadus2fj2471.png?width=2007&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb5ec12a9880920a4fafda29f931e3e1fd7b792a

Notice the slope of the line changed drastically. The earnings call in late March/early April was the kick in the ASO this thing needed. People started to realize this thing was undervalued and making fuck tons of money. 

# Today, ASO had their next earnings call. How'd it go?

First of all, I fucking hate premarket earnings calls. It's already hard enough to get out of bed with the thought of living in a world where people actually invest in PLTR. Moving on to the earnings; in short, they fucking killed it again and bigger than last time:

* Adjusted income of $182.5 million vs Q1 2020 $400,000 income **(profitability)**
* EPS of $1.89 (estimate was $0.90, 100%+ beat) vs Q1 2020 $0.01 **(shareholder value)**
* Revenues up 40% year over year to $1.6 billion vs already optimistic estimate of $1.5 billion **(sales)**
* Upped their 2021 guidance to $4.50 EPS (I think it was $3.90 or $4 or something who cares)

ASO is currently trading at a P/E ratio of about 9. The US industry average for specialty retail is about 15, representing a 50%+ upside based on P/E alone and not considering the fact that it's growing like your weird aunt's face boil (that thing's a tumor and you can't convince me otherwise)

# ""I see the lines and all the dildos, but what do I do?"" A fair question, fellow retard. I have no fucking clue...

Somehow today, and as has been tradition for the last 6 weeks or so, the stock price dropped some after killer earnings, allowing for a beautiful entry point. 

I like the stock. I like the trend. I like the business. You can deduce my July 16th positions by looking at the second screenshot if you're less than 96.7% retarded. This thing barely ever touches that the blue line on those charts because it's still undervalued. I thought the trend would slow and the growth would slow, but it hasn't yet and it only keeps getting better and better data to support the pattern.

This isn't a squeeze. No gamma, short, titty, or otherwise. This is a less direct path to the moon and mars than rolling the dice with your net worth on retarded FD moves. This is a solid play for your portfolios to hedge against your absolutely mind blowing decision making process, or lack thereof. 

See you on the moon.

Looking at the options chain also shows that call options for over 8 million shares have gone ITM since yesterday‚Äôs close. 

Last reported short interest was 40 million shares on may 14. This is about twice the short interest of AMC before last weeks squeeze. 

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CLOV?p=CLOV

This looks like the perfect setup for a combined short and gamma squeeze. I see no reason why CLOV couldn‚Äôt reach the same price point as AMC did last week (>$70). It might even go higher than that.


Edit: updated estimated short interest data from Ortex by u/idster put it at 44% of float (cfr AMC @ 12% and GME @ 18%).

&#x200B;

Just want to share some charts and information that I noticed while comparing AMC and GME before the squeeze

&#x200B;

So as you all know, this past week has been one for the books for AMC, from it's low on Monday, May 24th we witnessed an increase of 201% on AMC. Now this got me thinking and made me want to look back at the history of how GME started to move before it's squeeze.

&#x200B;

If you look at the candles closely, they are very very alot alike

&#x200B;

1. GME's breakout candle, on Thursday, January 13th and AMC's breakout candle, on Wednesday, May 13th are almost identical
2. After both breakouts, they traded above the bollinger bands for 3 back to back sessions
3. After GME's breakout, we saw a consolidation of price action for 5 trading sessions
4. After AMC's breakout we saw a consolidation of price action for 7 trading sessions
5. From GME's low on it's initial breakout to it's high the Friday before the squeeze, we saw on increase of 283%
6. From AMC's low on it's initial breakout to it's high the Friday before the potential squeeze, we saw an increase of 245%

&#x200B;

This is where things get interesting...

&#x200B;

The bullish candle that was formed for GME on Friday, January 22nd looks ALOT like the bullish candle formed on Thursday, May 27th for AMC

The spinning top candle that was formed for GME on Monday, Jan 25th looks alot like the spinning top candle formed on Friday, May 28th for AMC

&#x200B;

Taking into consideration the market is closed on memorial day, is this history repeating itself? If it is, that would mean the squeeze will start next week? Now I don't want to attach certain dates, I'm just sharing more information with you all. You be the judge of it.

202,TLRY,nktkfy,2021-05-25 18:18:02,Legalisation of marijuana is proceeding. Possibly TLRY (Tilray) will explode soon,"The US House of Representatives passed a bill last month that would allow banks to provide services to cannabis companies in the US. Thus, the banks would no longer operate illegal and unlawful financing should they offer loans and other services to the companies. That would be a huge step in removing what analysts are calling an obstacle to the development of a national cannabis industry.

Legislators voted for the bill with 321-101 votes and sent it to the Senate.

https://preview.redd.it/5mpqdo4tja171.jpg?width=660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1255ec4f5a2471772ca27ad86ea25c16167d241b

The bill clarifies that proceeds from legal cannabis deals are not considered illegal and instructs federal regulators to create rules on how they would oversee such banking activities. Banks have so far been unwilling to do business with companies that sell marijuana or related products, fearing they could run into conflict with US federal law. This has left marijuana companies with few options to rely on a handful of small financial institutions or do cash deals. The American Bankers Association has aggressively lobbied for the SAFE Banking Act bill.

The banks have been in a difficult position due to the conflict between state and federal law, so it makes sense that Congress must act now to resolve this conflict. Thirty-six US states have now legalized medical cannabis, while 17 states already allow recreational use of cannabis by adults.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would try to push legislation. The positive reaction of the stock prices of Tilray, Sundial Growers, Aphria or Aurora Cannabis shows the great relief of investors. Investors hope that this could have kicked off further progressive reforms in the cannabis sector. This move took the potential of a game-changing marijuana law an important step forward.

If Congress passes the SAFE Banking Act and President Joe Biden signs it, it would likely become much easier and cheaper for marijuana companies to raise the capital they need to fund their growth initiatives. The law should also make cannabis companies safer and more efficient, as credit services would reduce the need for cash in day-to-day operations.

All our favorite stocks in GME, AMC, BB, CLNE, CLOV, WKHS are spiking and it's a retard's dream come true.  Only problem is that we seem to be a bit scattered currently with almost 7 different tickers being mentioned over and over again.  Let's get straight to the point, we want to make money.  (By the way I'm not a financial advisor and anyone that takes advice from me is probably retarded).  Out of all the meme stocks, one stands out the most to me just because of fundamentals alone:



**CLNE.**



Now don't get me wrong, there's another certain stock that has to do with videogames which is shorted to oblivion and hedgies are absolutely fucked.  But we're talking about Mr. Clean right now.  



**How can this cow fart meme stock make me money you ask?** 



Well, it's the only one with the government on our side.  Mr. Biden is all about going green in the future and what better feel good story than turning cow fart into a natural gas that powers our vehicles?  This crazy company actually devised a way to transition their product from traditional CNG or LNG to something they call ""Renewable Natural Gas"" (RNG).  



**So how the fuck are they doing this??**



Let me explain.  The landfills, wastewater treatment facilities, ranches etc. create methane. They use some of it to power their facilities, but then are left with a fuck ton of leftover methane which, until CLNE came around, they would just burn off into the environment at a GWP of 30. And that's not a good number for us.  But our hero and savior CLNE takes the methane that's captured it and processes it into RNG, which they then transport to filling stations and use to fill up heavy transport vehicles. Those vehicles emit 1.1 GWP carbon, making them, technically, carbon negative.  And who eats this shit up??  Amazon.  Amazon recently created a pilot program by which they are buying 1,000 RNG powered vehicles for their fleet. CLNE did something brilliant a few years ago to put themselves in the position to be the ones who fuel these machines by building their refilling stations right next to Amazon's warehouses.  Not only that but Amazon will be buying 53 million shares at a strike price of $13.49 by the end of the decade from CLNE.

**Price**



The stock is currently trading around $10 because IB wants to keep it under $13 for the time being.  I'm sure you guys have read the gamma squeeze potential coming up on 6/18 so I'm not going to go too deep into that.  Basically if $CLNE hits $13 by June 18th, over 1.86 million shares become in the money for calls. And another 400,000 shares at 12, and 280,000 at 11, and 390,000 at 10.  The 5 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for Clean Energy Fuels Corp have a median target of 20.00, with a high estimate of 27.00 and a low estimate of 11.00  


[Source](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=CLNE)



It's a company that's easily worth at least double what it's trading at right now but because of the small float it's pretty easy to manipulate.  The IB's are fighting like hell to keep the price at 12.99 or lower which can be seen even in last week's last trading days where out of the total volume on Friday, 32% have have been sold short and it's an increase from Thursday where only 8% of the volume was sold short.  That kept that spike from $9 to $11 from getting out of control for them.

**The Play?**



Shares.  The small float means that shares can increase the price substantially causing IV to get bigger and makes the setup for the gamma squeeze that much more likely.  And even if you don't play the squeeze at all, this company is still a no brainer in terms of being undervalued currently and I predict to be $20+ by EOY.  



**TL;DR:**  Cow farts go BRRRRRRR.  Super undervalued company that has great potential in the future and actually has the fundamentals to support it.

223,DD,nw6lmm,2021-06-09 23:16:51,A quick DD on CLOV borrowing fee,"Since I saw a lot of misinformed comments in the daily threads, I figured I would share this information.

The current borrow fee rate for CLOV is 116.7% (https://iborrowdesk.com/report/clov). The borrow fee rate is not the short interest; that is the number of shares shorted. 

The borrow fee rate is the amount it costs per year to short a share, as shorting requires borrowing. To put it into perspective, for a costant price, a yearly borrow fee rate of 116.7% would imply a daily cost of paying 0.3197% of the value of the shorted share.

0.32% in the world of returns is a lot. 

Yesterday, the short interest rate on CLOV was 43.54% (https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1402368431291314177?s=20). This number might be lower now, as the borrowing fee rate depends on other factors (volatility, ease of locating shares) than just the supply available; shorts may have covered a bit. It will, however, not be a lot lower. What this implies is that for some 30%-50% of the number of shares available on CLOV, the shorts are paying 0.32% of the price of the share just for holding the position, every. single. day. 

The shorts are absolutely bleeding buckets. In fact, this situation, including the drop today, is incredibly similar to GME; I dare say even more so than AMC. Another great buy, support each other please.

I currently hold multiple call options comprising 19% of my portfolio, and that's only because GME takes up 60%.

Obligatory rocket emojis üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Edit: Since I made this thread I received a lot of good, confirming information, which I would like to summarize here:

- The short interest rate is currently at 50.42% according to Ortex.

- https://fintel.io/shortSqueeze model states CLOV is currently most likely to squeeze.

- questrade Canada also has a borrow fee of 59%.

- Additionally https://www.shortsight.com/ shows that CLOV has a bullish sentiment with a low share availability score of 4, meaning shares are confirmed really limited across the board. This means multiple brokerages are confirmed to have a hard time locating shares. That is huge. Remember what caused GME to not be allowed to be bought anymore? Borrowing fee rates were high for a ton of brokers, and some, including IBKR and Robinhood, had these high borrowing rates in place because they were running out of shares to locate. They could no longer provide the shares they are obligated to provide to those who either want to short or buy the share. And hence they shut both down, as otherwise the brokerages themselves would trigger an insane and instant shortsqueeze. An incredible indicator.

Last week and today AMC has had a very good rally, but this is just the beginning, now let me tell you why. (I know finance can be dense and complicated so i'll try to keep it simple)

# TLDR

\- There's a lot of options between 30 and 40 being placed which causes market makers to buy more shares causing a Gamma Squeeze today and after hours. If more large option volume is placed tomorrow between 40-50 the Gamma Squeeze will keep going, continuing so on and so forth.

\- Short holders will lose a lot of money as share price continues up, forcing them to buy more AMC to close their position sometime through the week.

\- üöÄüåëüöÄüåëüöÄüåë

# DD

The past few weeks have been great for meme stocks, but AMC is leading at the frontline of this rally outperforming the others like GME, BB, etc, boasting a 112% increase the past week. One of the reasons i've been able to hold confidence in, is AMC's option volume. A call is a contract to sell you 100 shares of a stock at a certain price. Behind this contract, are people called Market Makers. These are people sitting at investment banks and financial institutions, writing contracts for people to buy options if there is a lack of supply. Now let's look at the option chain for today expiring next week

[Weekly call options from yahoo finance](https://preview.redd.it/4k96sf790s271.jpg?width=1327&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6bf3ccff9fc9a91c18dbf10af372fa488a89b5fd)

If we look at the 2nd column from the right, that's the current volume of call options. Whenever people buy options, in order for market makers to minimize as much risk as possible, they buy stock in order to stay ""delta neutral"". Fancy phrase I know. A very basic explanation is that no matter where the stock moves, the market makers don't lose money. Their goal isn't to bet against you, their goal is to scalp the bid/ask margins. Now notice how the option volume is particularly high at 30, 35, and 40. As the price moves closer to these strike prices, market makers got to buy more shares in order to stay delta neutral. Now with this high volume, market makers need to buy **A LOT** more shares everytime the price goes up, which then snowballs larger and larger causing something called a ""Gamma squeeze"", which basically means STONK GO UP. Last week a similar phenomenon occured, now we can see it will especially rally up at the 30 (which it did), 35(which it did), and 40 mark (soon to come). Once we get closer to 40 hopefully tomorrow there will be more options being placed in order for the Gamma squeeze to continue, but until then we have the next phase.... the famous.... short squeeze...

Gamma squeeze is caused by an incrementation of options being placed which causes market makers to buy more shares to minimize their risk. Now that we've hit this point, the price has gone up a lot. Today alone AMC went up 40%. And. that. is. big. oh. no. to. short holders. Short holders are **borrowing** AMC shares in hopes AMC will go down so they can buy back the share at a cheaper price, luckily for us, these guys have not learnt their lesson! With AMC mooning from the Gamma squeezes, short holders will be hard red and and are **forced** to close out of their short position, requiring them to buy AMC driving the price up even further! This is what brought GME to it's peak of 400$/share. If we look at the short interest a month ago.

[Short interest a month ago from Ortex](https://preview.redd.it/yc81t36v0s271.png?width=1772&format=png&auto=webp&s=a80da820a287bc54ef2b20a905effe62f60bae4a)

We can see here AMC was 20% shorted. Through the month short holders continued to close more and more causing AMC to go up and up. This drove the value higher and higher, and now AMC is busting 38$/share. Now notice that cute little tick at the bottom.

[Short interest 2 weeks ago from Ortex](https://preview.redd.it/a8xq2ws71s271.png?width=1220&format=png&auto=webp&s=535e4ba376352ffc0e6f86ae37434372ce204faf)

We can see here AMC short interest dropped to 16% but it looks like these short holders are doubling down and are increasing their short position. Today alone we busted 40% increase in AMC, if we can keep going we can make short holders force to close and climb even higher heights. 16-20% doesn't seem like much, but doing the math....

Total shares in circulation = 448m ([taken from yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMC/key-statistics/))

Float % = 18% (paid ortex subscription as shown above)

Shares shorted = 80.6million

80.6 \* 37$ (current AMC share value at the time of writing) = $2.983b

.... needed to buy AMC. And that's before the AMC rocket takes off, it'll be even more while the rocket flies. So if any of you need any extra re-assurance, or a reason to put more money in, here ya go. If you guys want to continue the Gamma Squeeze, keep in mind the price needs momentum to carry up. Don't buy ridiculously far out call options like 70s or 80s because that won't give the stock an opportunity to climb up the 40s-60s range. It needs to be an incremental climb.

This is not financial advice, do your own research, and if you got any corrections for me please let me know! I'll edit my post or remove it completely if i missed/did something wrong

# Reversal

I'd be bs'ing you if i didn't say that this could go horribly wrong. The narrative i explained isn't **guaranteed to work**. In the case of bad news, or a large sell off, this can cause the price to fall or halt. Then the Gamma squeeze can't be sqoze which will then prevent the Short squeeze. Another point to keep in mind is **we don't know exactly when the short holders will cover**. They can double down and wait us out, but if we can keep the Gamma squeeze going, they'll have to close. To hold shorts you must pay a premium of [10%](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC) every year. This fee can increase though, and it has been steadily increasing as the price continues to go up.

This is not financial advice. Please do your own research and please... don't bet more than you can lose in case of these events. As for me, i'm waking up at market open tomorrow and yolo'ing the rest of my 10k into more call options before the rocket blasts.  üöÄüöÄüöÄüåëüåëüåë

I dont' want people to bag hold in case this thing pops like a lot of people did during GME. My plan to exit is to monitor when the volume on the option chain starts becoming low. You can check the [option volume here](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMC/options?p=AMC). Once the option volume becomes thin, there's not enough potential for a gamma squeeze. If the short interest becomes low, there's no chance for a short squeeze. If any of these happens, that's when i plan to stop buying weekly calls and sell my shares. Or if robinhood decides to ban AMC trading again....

# Update

Its happening, we goin to the moon bois! üöÄüåëüöÄüåë

Now that we've hit in the money for all strikes (it just hit 70), short squeeze **probably** sqoze (this doesn't mean all shorts covered, just the immediate ones such as hedge funds that are too far in the red or can't afford the premiums) I exited all my call options and taking profits. To those who are undoubtedly gonna say something about being paper handed, it's a good idea to constantly take profits and protect yourself. DFV took profits periodically himself. Take care of yourself and don't get too greedy. With that being said I still have a few hundred shares in AMC and gonna wait for another opportunity to play more options again.

Sup, honorable apecitizens! Recently I‚Äôve been working on this fascinating piece of TA, and now I am finally ready to share that with [you](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/msv8n1/tbh_i_only_trust_retards/). I am so confident in it, that I dared to put my beard (which I have for five years already) on the line! Worth your full read, I promise! I decided to structure the analysis in the following way: first we'll take a look at the VW short squeeze, revisiting its origins and background as the very first step of the discussion - in order to better understand the fundamental context of TA; after that I'll lay down the main technical parameters and frameworks, through which the [GMESS](https://imgur.com/a/Sd4uE1b) thesis will be dissected, applying all of those to VWSS and explaining the TA core on the Volkswagen example; then, the process will be repeated, but this time TSLASS anatomy will be elaborated upon. Finally, all of the data accumulated in the process, as well as the major findings made, will be applied to the current technical state of GME, in order to construct at least a potential forecast and the probable price action. Buckle up and eat a crayon, let's start.

Oh, and one more thing! I really encourage you to dive deep into the ANALysis with me, because the thesis can only be understood if all of the technical factors at play are considered in the sharpest detail first - and then in the aggregate: zooming out and looking at the bigger picture through the prism of coincidences, interdependences and probabilities. Dafaq did I just write? - Dunno, but that's exactly what I meant!

# Volkswagen - Das Short-Squeeze: Sep 2007 - Mar 2009

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Remember, when VW became the most valued company in the world for a brief wild period of trading? I bet, Pepperidge apes remember. The squeeze played out right in the midst of the global financial crisis, and such an occurrence was fueled by a curious background scenario, orchestrated largely by one very interesting person. Back then, the former President of Porsche, Wendelin Wiedeking (must be a cousin of Battlefield Counterstrike), was pursuing a goal of taking over Volkswagen. In this process, he used cash-settled options to circumvent the transparency and disclosure of Porsche‚Äôs market operations. While being acquired by Porsche, Volkswagen had its ordinary shares premium risen to disproportionately high levels compared to its preference shares.

As the general public was finding out about Wendysking‚Äôs takeover plan, hedge funds and particularly short-sellers set their eyes on the fact that Volkswagen‚Äôs preferred shares were traded at a significant discount to the ordinaries (approximately 70%). While the price of the ordinary stock gradually increased, the preferential shares stayed put - and the hedge funds smelt an arbitrage opportunity. They started shorting the stock and buying the preferred shares to profit on the massive divergence. For a moment, there was no news of Porsche continuing its purchase of VW ordinaries from the market, and that fact gave the hedge funds additional confidence. Only to get blindsided, as it turned out later. One shorts-frying weekend, Porsche announced its total holding in VW, cornering the substantial part of the float, and leaving only 6% in free float. In the meantime, short sales had risen to 12% of total stock outstanding. When the market found out that Porsche had acquired 74.1% of the outstanding shares through the in-transparent cash-settled options, VWSS happened - briefly making Volkswagen the largest company in the world, and finally allowing the shorting side to [GUH](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpnzup/i_recorded_todays_marketopen_and_the_instant/):

&#x200B;

>It was mathematically impossible for every short-seller to buy a share, and therefore close their position. In other words, half the room were going to be left in a burning building with no way out. A panicked dash for the exit began.

&#x200B;

‚Äî A spot on metaphor by Jamie Powell, an FT journalist. Hedge funds are estimated to have lost $20 to $30 billion by betting against VW ordinary stock.

What is really ironic (in Palpatine voice) - even though Porsche managed to burn many short sellers, the company couldn‚Äôt pay up for the huge positions it had created, and ended up being acquired by VW instead.

Also, interestingly enough, after his departure from Porsche, Wiedeking was charged with market manipulation for his role in the takeover bid. The charges were dropped in July 2016 due to a too little chance of success. Lucking Fegend.

&#x200B;

**Now let‚Äôs take a look at how this epic event was incorporated into the chart:**

[VWSS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/d3pfzvb202z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e497ddf6518faec188269120c44df64ab6cb1791)

Even though it all looks overwhelming from the first glance, don't worry, I'll explain. There are only two major TA instruments used here, namely Fibonacci retracement üåàtool (useful for assessing 'altitude' and the crucial support/resistance levels, check out the in-depth explanation of this TA tool [in my other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mwevzz/the_big_short_20_why_bears_may_soon_reconsider/)). The second one is the trend based Fibonacci extension for time periods (pink vertical grid with numbers 0, 0.382, 0.618 and so on) - for setting the major time landmarks and zones. Furthermore, you should have noticed the three catchy geometric figures, and the purple line - which is actually a good starting point to unfold the technical thesis.

In the process of working with VW, TSLA and GME charts, I managed to identify several peculiar characteristics and patterns, that were of an evident nature and have been manifested on all of the three charts, to one degree or another. The most prominent one, in my opinion, is the killer purple resistance/support level. For the current VW example, it is somewhere around $30 mark, or $29.27 if you like precision.

One may observe on the chart above, that this level is indeed the most significant level through the complete history of VWSS. First, the preliminary to the squeeze major bull run, which solidly accelerated in the middle of September 2007, was held back and repulsed by this level's resistance on the last day of October. It took almost half a year for the price action to catch up to it again in late March 2008. This was followed by a consolidation (with several failed attempts of breakout) just below this level, which lasted for more than 100 days, before the price action finally torn the resistance apart with the powerful gap on the 16th of July '08. And guess what? Even after that, the level played the major supportive role for the price action, with one final retest before the squeeze finally lift off it in the middle of September 2008. You should also make a note of how the price was still magnetized by this level during the final stages of the squeeze. The signifficance of this price level for the whole chart of VW above is difficult to underestimate. Seeing the importance of this level and being a fan of Jimi Hendrix, I decided to name it ""**Purple Haze**"".

Let's inspect the fancy geometric shapes now. These are actually much more reasoned and circumspective than it may seem from the first glance. The first one, in orange, is a cup shaped consolidation (let it be called the ""**Squeezy Grail**"", because why not?) - taking place above 100% Fibo and just below the 'Purple Haze'  - which commenced as soon as this major resistance level had been tested for the first time. It is subsequently followed by the second consolidation of a flatter nature \[if you know what else is of a flatter nature, comment and if the joke is good enough I may give you an award\], which again plays around the main $30 level on the chart. The second consolidation, highlighted by the pink rectangle (a.k.a. the ""**Runway**""), is actually more important than the first one, because here is the point where the paramount breakout happens: the 'Purple Haze' resistance is blew off (in the middle of 0.382 period). Based on that observation, it is also appropriate to assume that in order for the squeeze to initiate, the 'Purple Haze' has to be conquered at some point inside 0.382 Fibo time zone, during the 'Runway' stage. Finally, the triangular ""**Squieezluminati Confirmed**"" part is self explanatory, imho. Oh, just one commentary worth being made here: take a look at how the squeeze itself is proportionate, bipartite, and fits well into the isosceles triangle. The nature surely knows how to play with stonks, too.

Especially, when we talk about Fibonacci. The horizontal üåà grid, Fibo retracement, is often used to estimate the possible corrective trend's depth, as well as to identify the key support and resistance levels of it. This one is comfortably applied to the beninging and the apex point of the trend (see the gray dash and dash line on the chart above), and its relevance is subsequently confirmed by how the price action plays around the levels in the triangle. The 12th of September '07 seems to be a good starting point for Fibo retracement application, because on that day another important resistance of $20.72 was penetrated for the first time (then confirmed as support with the beautiful bear trap candle on 23 Jan '08). Furthermore, $20.72 level works like an ideal 100% Fibo retrace level for the current example, and supports the 'Holy Grail' comparable to how my granny supports me. Also, take a note of the 'Purple Haze' being relatively in the middle, in between 78.6% and 100% of Fibo retracement - an important factor that will enable us to apply this retracement to GME later.

Not only the 12th of September fits well as Fibo retracement starting point, it is also a perfect spot to start stretching out the trend-based Fib time grid (TBFTG - to be fucked then go, alternatively). This one is a complex instrument, so take this quick explanation for granted or do your own research in relation to it. Just like Fibo retracement, TBFTG is based on Fibonacci sequence, but this one applies to time periods, instead of the price action and levels. In order to use this instrument properly, it is necessary to identify the preliminary major trend, that will serve as the core measurement for the sequent time periods. Oh, it took me a lot of time to inspect that parameter and to identify those initial pink dash and dash trends, trust me! Tbh, it was one of the most difficult tasks to accomplish in the preparation of this TA. But the result was worth the effort! I noticed the following correlation applicable to both VWSS and TSLASS (and hypothetically to GME too): TBFTG pink dash measurement must involve the major preliminary impulse of the prior main trend, plus 'Squeezy Grail' phase. The staring point of TBFTG is particularly tricky to be identified, and I'm talking about all of the examples, but possible - especially when looking at the TA as a whole, referring to how the grid applies to the price action, and comparing the examples between each other. That is pure rocket science, if you ask me. And most importantly, the TBFTG measurement duration (pink dash and dash trend) seem to be very similar in length to 'Squieezluminati' basis - check the bars measurements on all of the charts (blue lines for VW).

Pay attention to the following features, which really help to dissect the squeezes' anatomies and to build the suitable technical framework: *the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone; and the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, peaking at 1*; *TBFTG pink dash measurement includes major preliminary trend plus 'Squeezy Grail', as it has been mentioned above. Furthermore, the correlation in duration of TBFTG measurement and the triangle basis must once again be emphasized.*

Noice, but let's move further.

# Tesla, or how Elon Mask truly ‚Äúis become meme, Destroyer of shorts‚Äù: Apr 2019 - Apr 2020

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Tesla and the founder Elon Musk have confronted the short sellers on a regular basis, and even after the run-ins with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for now, the former have been winning. The TSLA shorters were sitting on mark-to-market losses of over $40 billion in late 2020, as the company‚Äôs shares exploded 740% last year. This information is based on data collected by Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, a fin-anal company.

Remember the not so distant in past Tesla 'mania'? The prospects of Tesla‚Äôs business and the furious opposition of bulls and bears, including famous fund managers like David Einhorn and Mark Spiegel (who still hold a strong opinion that TSLA is a house of cards ready to collapse), have over the years contributed to an extreme volatility in the stock price. Elon Musk openly criticized the short-sellers and their motivation to dig out and spread negative sentiment about the company. The 'taking Tesla private' play seemed to work out for the short-sellers as the stock price collapsed by about 50% from November 2018 to May 2019. After that, amidst Tesla‚Äôs opening of the Shanghai Gigafactory and the announcement of the company's first annual operating profit exceeding analyst expectations, the tables have turned and the bear-beaten TSLA shares skyrocketed in price (not without noble WSBetters help, definitely). Needless to say, that previously steady short-sellers started getting anxious and scrambled to cover their positions.

&#x200B;

Dusaniwsky told Institutional Investor (B2B media) that shorting Tesla is:

>The longest unprofitable short I‚Äôve ever seen!

&#x200B;

Well, Mr. Dusaniwsky, WSB seem to have an answer for everything:

https://preview.redd.it/h3l5hayu02z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecc69df97a282c4a22663e8487cf316488ed9d32

&#x200B;

While companies and founders often hold a scorn on short sellers, because they can bring down stock prices and cause the cost of capital to rise (or even do worse things, if you know what I mean), Musk‚Äôs disdain for the short selling community is unrivaled. In the middle of 2020, Musk took a dig at short sellers by releasing 'short shorts'. These now sell at a premium on Ebay. It's all nice and good, but I have another cool merch idea - '**shortz r fuk**':

[TSLASS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/f0qbrpqn22z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=479c78e6763043f81e9ac2c75cf8a6c769d9eee4)

&#x200B;

Beautiful, isn't it? Let's quickly run through the short squeeze anatomy checklist, thoroughly elaborated in the previous TA chapter via the example of VW. First things first, the 'Squeezy Grail' is present, but it resembles more of a V shape structure. Next, the 'Runway' stage is good-looking: a fucking massive gap happened there, and this time 78.6% Fibo level is tested during the 'Runway', being indicative of the TSLA bulls' crazy power. 'Squieezluminati Confirmed' is also really interesting here, as this time there is no isosceles triangle at its core structure, but rather a 'chainsaw'-like volatile price action taking place. Furthermore, you may see that inside of the triangle, there is the after-peak 78.6% Fibo zone retest, which in turn hedl and bounced the price back in the direction of... Moon. Blessed be the bulls!

Looking at the 'Purple Haze' (which is again in between Fibo 78.6% and 100% \[important!\]), for TSLASS the major price level manifested at $52.46. During the first half of 2019, this level played a role of a magnetizing support, with the subsequent testing in March and the breakout to the downside in late April. Again, a lengthy, half a year long consolidation is taking place just below this level, and above Fibo 100% retracement. The breakout occurs, you guessed, right in the TBFTG 0.382 zone. And what is really fascinating, is the fact that, after the breakout, the 'Purple Haze' has never been retested. But who knows what the future holds?

And the Fibos. The retracement, again, apples perfectly onto the complete squeeze structure: 78.6% is trialed several times; all of the upper levels except for 38.2% were broken with the subsequent retrace and and some with the retest. A particularly intensive price action was occurring for about two weeks near the 23.6% Fibo level, and the high of $189.4 level was penetrated and then touched gently during the initial squeeze. Ah, almost forgot, 100% ($35.75) Fibo level firmly holds the 'Squeezy Grail' in hand again.

Current TBFTG should be of an interest for fellow TAnaLyzators too. Particularly, the downtrend, as opposed to VW uptrend, serves as the core for TBFTG's application (again, refer to the dash and dash pinkish line). This core is composed of the pre-'Squeezy Grail' downtrend plus the Grail itself. Take a look at gray measurements, which cover this phase and the triangle duration - again these two follow the tendency of being proportionate in the length as phases. *Crucially, the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone again; then one more time the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, with the false first peak during the final stages of 0.618 and the proper peak at 1*.

Too many coincidences and congruences between the two TA examples discussed above, if you ask me. Especially if the fact that such events happen once in ten years or so is taken into account. Two quotes are of a relevance here:

&#x200B;

>Coincidences mean you're on the right path - *Simon van Booy*

&#x200B;

>If you gaze long enough into an asshole, the asshole will gaze back into you - u/roman_axt

&#x200B;

Some additional food for thought from TSLA:

[For redditors with a different floor](https://preview.redd.it/gnd0yienc2z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8b72e1671ad69cf871cde154ae386e52835e94a)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Game stopped, or it is just a beginning?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I am absolutely confident that you all know even more than myself about the fundamental factors at play for GME, so I will not bother you here with the background explanation. There is a plenty of good HQ DD all around reddit, so let's jump straight to the sweet sweet TA:

[GMESS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/ko1ppnasc2z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d3f7c2a78135696d66a0a70e8e2a34ad4a04dbf)

&#x200B;

At this point, I feel that a disclaimer is necessary. Let me briefly remind you that this analysis is a thesis, or a hypothesis that has to be proven in the future. I do believe that there is a solid probability for things to play out this way, and my beard supports my manly confidence. However, this is the market, and it all may go another way at any point in time, that's the nature of things! Think critically, learn and do your own DD and TA. In a good memory of u/ControlTheNarrative, at least.

And so, it begins. Despite it may seem that there are too many unknown or at least questionable variables for now in this GMESS TA, I believe that I was able to identify the most crucial parameters to build the core of this technical analysis's thesis, since VWSS and TSLASS provided many clues and identifiable characteristics to refer to. The first and most important one is surely the 'Purple Haze'. I should remind you, that this mystically sounding level persistently held back the price for both of the squeeze examples discussed, and only upon the breakout of this level the short squeezes were initiated. For GME this major price level seems to be at about $233 mark, with two intensive tests in Jan and Mar, which proved it to be the most significant resistance on the chart above.

Then, the shapes. The 'Squeezy Grail' (again occurring in between 78.6% and 100%) consolidation is also easily identifiable here, and it is yet again followed by the rectangular 'Runway' consolidation, where the price action currently stands. Remember, how historically (in TSLA and VW) the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurred somewhere near the spot of the current GME price action, in 0.382 Fibo time zone? Well, to paraphrase Ian Fleming: once is (VW) happenstance. Twice is (TSLA) coincidence. Three times is GMenemy action.

Fibos. Applying these two instruments to GME was real pain in the ass. Firstly, because the retracement is not usually used as a predictive instrument, being ordinarily applied to the completed trend. But since the situation is not ordinary at all, I played smarter (or more autistic, if you like). Due to the fact that the 'Purple Haze' level was approximately in between 78.6% and 100% Fibo in both of the previous examples, I assumed exactly that to be applicable here too. My belief is firmly backed up by this soft touch of 78.6% by the price action on Jan 28th. And when these two major levels were identified, the Fibo retracement horizontal grid just stretched out on GME itself.

Identifying the starting points for the trend for both Fibos was the most tricky part. After countless attempts and failures I found what I believe to be the cornerstone to the squeeze:

[Fibos' initiation point zoomed in](https://preview.redd.it/t2ouren1d2z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1cd87d96bb42ac20451c86059295f7560c8c44e8)

&#x200B;

Why? Because this                        ‚òùÔ∏è is clearly where the fun started.

And now it all matches perfectly. So, I am patiently waiting for the 'Purple Haze' to be broken. And what do you do, fellow retard?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They say, that coincidence doesn't happen a third time. I say, we shall see.

**TL;DR** is in the comments.

I've been in the business for many moons. I have dealt with MANY companies. I‚Äôve seen MANY business types, I have seen transitions in business models as producers have dealt with energy price crashes. I work directly with company executives all the way down to operators and hands. I like talking to everyone and absorbing as much knowledge as I can, even though I‚Äôm mentally retarded.

Even though you morons can‚Äôt read, have your wife‚Äôs/gf‚Äôs boyfriend read this to you and DRILL it in your fucking smooth brain: LIQUID NATURAL GAS (LNG) DEMAND IS RISING AND WILL CONTINUE TO RISE FOR THE NEXT DECADE (‚ÄúdEcAde‚Äù is a period of ten years for you single digit IQ fucks) AND BEYOND. LNG will be the ‚Äútransition‚Äù fuel between dirtier energy sources and ""green"" energy. This transition is coming sooner than we think. 


Are you following?


What's this LNG, you might ask. You need to liquefy gas (basically ‚Äúconcentrating‚Äù it) so that it becomes economical to ship overseas. Overseas markets for LNG is massive and growing. Seriously look it up, EU, China, and others are increasingly relying on the stuff. It‚Äôs much more expensive for them to produce than the US.

When a producer (the company that puts together millions of dollars to drill a well) drills for oil, if your drill and zone prediction (a ‚Äúzone‚Äù is the area that a geologist, paid for by the producer, finds to contain oil) is correct, 99% of the time, three products will flow to the earth‚Äôs surface in your process. These three are water, oil, and NATURAL GAS. Producers will separate oil and water dispose of this waste water into a disposal well thousands and thousands of feet deep. Producers will then sell the oil.‚Ä¶ What happens to the gas?? Well, if the producer is lucky, there will be a pipeline within a mile or two of their well. They will have to pay WAY over 200K to 500K just welding a mile of gas pipeline to tie into this sales line then pay 100 to 250K for a LACT unit. This is why oilfield welders have fewer IQs than I do but make $150/hr, depending upon pipeline wall thickness (dependent upon flowing pressures and how safe the producer wants to be if not bound by DOT regulations)

If these costs aren‚Äôt too high, and the well is producing as much product as expected, then great, they sell gas. However, if they're producing less oil than predicted, or they're producing thousand of barrels of water per day, their disposal costs will be so high, they can‚Äôt afford to build the pipeline, they will just burn the stuff. Seriously, I can not tell you HOW MUCH GAS IS JUST BURNED. The VAST majority of producers just ‚Äúflare‚Äù the gas. Just the ‚Äúflare‚Äù vessel is like $30K. Imaging paying $30K to burn LNG that's worth 100s of thousands of dollars. I worked in the Permian basin in West Texas. Anyone here with this experience can vouch for me. At night, in the Permian, the sky is literally lit up with these flares. It‚Äôs like you're a goddamn ant on a fucking birthday cake that‚Äôs for both for your great great great mothers and her boyfriend‚Äôs birthday (basically a shit load of candles). It‚Äôs an amazing sight.

¬≠---------wWhY dO tHeY DoO WasTE gAAS??------------------

You‚Äôre in the middle of fucking NOWHERE. You‚Äôd have to run hundreds of miles of pipeline to sell the gas. This would cost more than drilling the well. No company in their right mind would do this. The only options is to flare it. This one company I was working for was burning over 100K worth of natural gas per MONTH PER WELL, they had FIVE wells. The US just burns the crap, we can produce it so cheap, it just makes more sense to burn it rather than bothering to sell it. Gas is a nuisance to us. Other countries would die for it. There is actually new technologies that converts LNG into GASOLINE for cars. If you‚Äôre a stupid brain dead fuck who doesn't believe me, fucking Google it. 



-------So what about this TeLlUriAn coMpaNIee?-----------

Charif Souki started Tellurian. If you don‚Äôt know who he is, he is a LNG god. He was a banker on Wall St, highest paid CEO years ago, pioneered the LNG industry. He and his team are impeccable. If you want to build a LNG empire, you hire Souki, if you want to know the future of hydrocarbon energy, you hire Souki, if you want a new boyfriend for your wife, you hire Souki. He built Cheniere Enerny (about 2 hours from my house), a company with $10billion in revenue and is trading $80/share. 
He was fired because Carl Ichan was a complete bully. The business was not being built to Soukies vision. Soukie took the best staff members along with him and started Tellurian. Can you imagine their trust in this guy? Leaving an established company to start a new one... LNG business model is requiring a change and Soukie realizes this. It will need to be produced at less cost, current business models aren‚Äôt sustainable. Cheniere Energy is over 20 BILLION dollars in debt. Yes, $20 BILLIOOONNNNNNNN. Guess how much debt Tellurian has? ZERO, NONE, $0.00. This is UNHEARD of in a new company in this industry. 

Tellurian just signed a 10 BILLION dollar purchase agreement from ONE company. TELL is currently talking deals with at least 4 other companies. This 10 billion dollar deal is a 10 year agreement. This is 1 billion per year. Their current market cap is just over 1 billion. Do you realize yet how undervalued this company is?? It‚Äôs mind blowing. They begin their Driftwood facility construction in Louisiana this summer. This will be the terminal to export LNG, 32 billion dollar project.

Do you know whats even better?? They wont completely rely on third party producers selling them gas to liquefy, BECAUSE THEY DRILL AND PRODUCE THEIR OWN GAS. They started drilling again after a brief pause due to covid-19. We pay for monthly reports of all producers who receive state permits for drilling. Just this month Tellurian has TWO permits.

Souki uploads regularly to YouTube (seriously what other major high level executive does this??), he was on Jim Cramers show multiple times, Jim Cramer was always contrary to Souki‚Äôs predictions, and SOUKI ALWAYS turned out RIGHT. Look it up, these are Jim Crammer‚Äôs words, NOT mine. Just a day or two ago, Souki said in his YouTube video ‚Äúwe are preparing for the ride of a lifetime.‚Äù I assume this is his way of telling us ‚Äúbuy in now you fucking retards‚Äù without being fined by the SEC.

------------HOW is ThiS LIKE GME, AMC, BB?-----------------

THE SHORT POSITIONS OMG YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS BY NOW. IT‚ÄôS 17%!! Most of these positions were taken out at pandemic start. The joke is on them, Tellurian paid off their debts during their worst time HAHAHAHAHA. There WILL be a short squeeze. These shorts have no fucking clue about this dream team, the true depth of industry, and future of LNG production. 


---------------------hOw MuchH CanI MAKe?---------------------

At the VERY VERY least, I‚Äôm betting we run to pandemic level of $10-11/share (REMEMBER THIS WAS BEFORE THEY EVEN SIGNED ANY PURCHASE AGREEMENTS!!!). Calls are still cheap.

247,BB,nvo3ym,2021-06-09 07:26:19,$BB - Expect Large Movements Within 1 Month - Part 7,"Another day another analysis.

The past two days have looked stronger than you may think. Let's look at the chart.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6cuvfei3e6471.png?width=1926&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d0c6d898c08d0b5627c8f842c2f2b908a4e294e

Sitting right at the top of the Bollinger band, strong signal that the upside will continue. Still large volume today and yesterday means that the \~$15-16 USD range is going to act as a strong base for us going forward.  
200DMA moving upwards, Bollinger Bands slightly still expanding, looks bullish. 

The hourly chart will paint us a better picture for our baseline.  


https://preview.redd.it/yk78c534e6471.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=f31b4e32c5bd961cdfd1b9f7813cd60e8c965d62

MASSIVE wall at 14.50, just as I've been strongly stating throughout this run. It acted as the signal to the upside on the left arrow, when we sold off it acted as support with a strong bounce, and again another test and won back.   
14.50 will continue to be acting as strong support moving forward, if we fail a test at 14.50 I would expect 12.10 to come.

Bollinger Bands are tightening again indicating price movement is imminent. This can be in part of the fact of the BB Investor Information Seminar tomorrow  
([https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/investors](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/investors)) 

### Baird 2021 Global Consumer, Technology & Services Conference

I doubt anything huge will be announced here but more information is always better.  
RSI looking healthy.  


https://preview.redd.it/iu895vv4e6471.png?width=1860&format=png&auto=webp&s=90999fa1816c8ea8283277413e0e09705172a2f7

Upwards wedge appears to be forming and lines up nicely with the Bollinger Bands. There will be movement either tomorrow or Thursday I am expecting a  20% pop to the upside.  
A lot of calls at $15 this week, expect to stay above this with all the strength and momentum BB is showing right now.  


Immediate resistance shows \~$17.20 USD. Acted as support in the January run on the 25th and 26th but now is acting as a strong wall. After $17.20, $20 is easily in sight.

  
Reducing my EOW target of $24-33 to $20-24, to stay conservative, though one solid piece of news tomorrow can make the difference.  


Volume is critical. Definitely has slowed down Friday Monday and again today but eyes are still on us. This is technically speaking this is great play right now, run up hard with a healthy pullback into a cup and handle. Strong baseline which is pushing higher highs and higher lows. Massive support at 14.50 with strong upside potential. Easy 50% gains if volume comes back  
Still extremely bullish.

Take care, and stay healthy.",DD,0.82

TWNK is seeing the highest IV spike of any options today, second only to IVR.

So I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**

1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.
2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  

[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

[A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/u1p8k5w2vyz61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313b90056ba27d95c63cbff50b7e0142d84b327)

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

That is not the case. I am going to ride the wave up and get out and die in the void of fucking space. Be sure to sell when the profits meet your expectation and do not gamble with money that you cannot afford to lose. 

**Derp:**

We are at a critical point for AMC; either we make it or don't. I have the utmost faith in the community and in all the shareholders that we are going to be able to hold and not succumb to the pressures of major financial entities. I, for one, will not be selling. I have waited 6 months and invested thousands of dollars into an idea and cause that I believe. It is a total success or complete failure for me. I am not saying that it needs to be that way for you, but we can only win this together. I have been reading a lot of varying opinions on the future of AMC stock. From a technical standpoint, we have reached the top. However, if we can develop a strong uptrend, we can win. I just wanna be that guy getting his knob slobbed in the handicap stall in a Wendy's bathroom for once in my miserable cuck life. 

**Technical Analysis:**

We are at a major determining point for AMC First, let's look at the Daily (left side): We hit an RSI of around 96 the second time and are highly oversold. The first time it markets a temporary Top! Normally a stock moves in Waves. We detached from the MAs and are likely to return to the 50 EMA earlier or later. Volume Analyses also show signs of excessive bullish volume we normally see on overshooting tops.

Let's look at a shorter time frame now (4h - right side): We see a weakening RSI. The Trend has not broken down so far, and the 9 ema is still holding. I suggest at least set a stop or Trailing stop below here. The VolumeAnalyses is showing sell signs (red triangle down) In case of a pullback, the first ""Volume support"" is around 15, marking the top of the prior re-accumulation phase. A backtest of the ""last point of support"" is normally needed to confirm the bias and regain strength for the next move. The bullish scenario would be a pullback on low volume that is holding the support zones.

However, Exploring Gann fans. AMC has been respecting the 1:2 and trading in that channel. If the Current low respects the 1:1 trend line, then there's room for a move from 45 to 216 in one day. Not that it will, but that's the ""reasonable"" limit. If it significantly breaks the 1:1, well, then the fun's over, I suppose.

Note: Gann Fan is built using the lows from the 24th and 27th; the connection to the close on Friday is a coincidence.

To understand what CLOV should be worth today, look at [OSH](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/OSH/) and [AGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AGL?p=AGL&.tsrc=fin-srch). Not only did all three companies go public within the last year, but they are all similar-sized [Direct Contracting Entities](https://innovation.cms.gov/innovation-models/gpdc-model) (DCE) competing for ""lives under management"" *(Note: you'll see companies report this number using the term patients, members, or beneficiaries. They're all equivalent)*. This term simply means Medicare patients that the company is financially +/- clinically responsible for. Medicare pays $850+ per beneficiary per month for these companies to take on the risk of managing their healthcare costs. You can think of it as a lower margin (5-10% EBITDA) Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model that generates stable recurring revenue on a monthly basis for each patient being managed.

CLOV started out as a Medicare Advantage (MA) insurance plan, which is pretty similar to Direct Contracting (DC). That's because [the DC model was designed based on the MA model](https://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/view/cms-direct-contracting-model---is-it-still-one-of-the-value-based-models-built-on-fee-for-service-chasis-) by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). CMS launched the DC program in April 2021, and CLOV, OSH, and AGL among the first 53 organizations approved.

OSH does a good job of explaining how the Medicare Advantage market (and now the DC market) works:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t0utrzxkgp371.png?width=887&format=png&auto=webp&s=f68cd3b940c33b8c41e51c51cd270e8f7208cd8e

MA Plans are insurance companies that partner with specific healthcare providers to help manage the cost of their patients. The MA plan gets the $850+ monthly payment, and is [required by law to spend at least 85%](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2013/05/23/2013-12156/medicare-program-medical-loss-ratio-requirements-for-the-medicare-advantage-and-the-medicare) of it on medical costs. They usually do this by giving 85% of the $850+ monthly payment to the healthcare provider, and thereby transfer the risk of unexpectedly high costs to the provider caring for the patient. The DC model works the same, except Medicare pays the Direct Contracting Entity (DCE) $850+ monthly. What's interesting about DC is that any type of organization can be a DCE. CLOV is an insurance company (MA plan) that creates networks of healthcare providers for their plan members. AGL is a Management Service Organization (MSO) that provides services to healthcare providers that care for Medicare Advantage patients. And OSH *is* a healthcare provider that operates brick-and-mortar clinics focused on Medicare Advantage patients.

Medicare Advantage represents [26 million Americans](https://www.medicareresources.org/medicare-benefits/medicare-advantage/), accounting for about 36 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries. The DC program was launched by CMS so that Medicare Advantage companies like CLOV, AGL, and OSH could help manage the other 46 million Medicare beneficiaries in order to transition away from fee-for-service healthcare. **It's a huge deal.**

Below I'll break down the key numbers driving the valuation of these three companies for their Medicare Advantage business. The DC business is obviously new, but I'll predict what the valuations will look like in DC afterward. **The most important thing to understand here is that the valuation for all three of these companies is the number of lives under management multiplied by a dollar amount. The dollar amount is the market saying how much they believe in the company's ability to profitably manage those patients.**

Disclaimer: I'm not saying all three companies should be valued exactly the same. I am arguing that the dollar amount per managed life should be within a much tighter window because the gross margin for managing a Medicare life (MA or DC) will always end up in a very tight window (5-10% of revenue) no matter what model you deploy.

**OSH = $14.3B market cap**

OSH is obviously liked the most by the market based on their valuation. It's partly because they run the clinics so they can keep more of the Medicare dollar (instead of splitting it with the healthcare provider that takes on the risk). Employing clinicians also allows them to theoretically do more to improve health outcomes and control costs. In this model, the MA Plan takes 15% off the top, and the rest goes to OSH.

* **OSH gross margin = 6.7%** ([source](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/osh/financials))
* **75,500 total managed lives growing to 112,000 this year** ([source](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/oak-street-health-projects-strong-growth-2021-despite-64m-loss-q1))
* **That's a valuation of $125,000 per patient**

**AGL = $14.3B market cap**

AGL holds the contract with the MA plan and then pays the contracted (not employed) healthcare provider. In this model, the MA Plan takes 15% of the premium off the top, and the rest is split between AGL and the provider practices.

* **AGL gross margin = 7%** ([source](https://capital.com/agilon-health-ipo-will-the-stock-soar-in-2021))
* **165,300 total risk-based patients growing to 210,000 this year** ([source](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-agilon-health-ipo/healthcare-platform-agilon-valued-at-about-11-billion-in-nyse-debut-idUSKBN2C22D7))
* **That's a valuation of $66,667 per patient**

**CLOV = $3.65B market cap**

CLOV has historically been just a MA plan, taking the 15% of the premium off the top and paying the rest to cover the patient's costs ([source](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2013/05/23/2013-12156/medicare-program-medical-loss-ratio-requirements-for-the-medicare-advantage-and-the-medicare)). MA plans have an average profit margin of 4.3% after all their admin and sales expenses are accounted for ([source](https://mhk.com/medicare-advantage-is-the-golden-egg-for-health-plans/)).

* **CLOV historical gross margin (before COVID effect) = 2.5-4.1 %** ([source](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/static-files/ed2bc09d-cd96-4759-897e-862c2b250213))
* **132,000 total risk-based patients growing to 160,000 this year** ([source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/17/2230595/0/en/Clover-Health-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results.html))
* **That's a valuation of $22,800 per patient**

**AGL is a good preview of how the DC market could be valued per Medicare patient, except the DC model could be even better. There is no MA plan taking 15% off the top in between the risk-bearer (Direct Contracting Entity: CLOV, AGL, or OSH) and Medicare. Direct Contracting patients could be valued as high as $76,667 (15% premium over current AGL patients).**

The CEO of OSH was recently quoted ""**the per-patient economics of that program will potentially be better than the company had initially estimated""** ([source](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/oak-street-health-projects-strong-growth-2021-despite-64m-loss-q1))**.**

Here are the number of Medicare patients enrolled by each DCE (since the program launched in April 2021):

* **OSH: 6,500** managed lives ([source](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/oak-street-health-projects-strong-growth-2021-despite-64m-loss-q1))
* **AGL**: **50,000** managed lives ([source](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001831097/98fb566d-8f47-4a36-bd48-6bef5745cf56.pdf))
* **CLOV: 65,000** managed lives ([source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/17/2230595/0/en/Clover-Health-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results.html))

Hopefully now those valuation ranges I presented at the top make a little more sense to you.

//

# Here's an outline of how the Clover Assistant (CA) platform improves treatment decisions and risk adjustment for the provider:

* **More informed doctors delivering better treatment and care**
   * CA will make treatment recommendations using evidence-based guidelines
   * Primary care providers manage so many different conditions, it's impossible for them to keep up with all the medical literature
   * CA will present the latest evidence-based guidelines as simple recommendations, so that the primary care provider doesn't have to stay up-to-date on the most advanced treatment pathways for every condition
* **More accurate documentation for higher Medicare payments (MA and DC)**
   * The monthly $850+ payment to MA and DC organizations is adjusted based on the patient's risk score (basically how many health conditions they have)
   * The risk score is calculated using diagnosis codes (ICD-10 codes) that are entered into the electronic health record (EHR) by the doctor and eventually included in the insurance claim that goes to the MA plan (and Medicare)
   * Providers often forget to include all the codes in the insurance claim, or even sometimes forget to properly document it in the EHR
   * Providers also forget to re-document codes on an annual basis, because on January 1 all of the diagnosis codes are erased in Medicare's risk score calculation because some diagnoses can change (e.g. cancer remission)
      * This sounds stupid, but if a diabetic patient has an amputated foot, Medicare acts like it grows back on Jan 1 and the doctor has to document the diagnosis again
      * Medicare is either too lazy to discern between permanent vs reversible conditions, and/or they like that they get to pay less for an inaccurately lower risk score
   * When providers forget to include one or more codes, that means the risk score will be lower and the premium received by the MA plan will be lower
   * CLOV's software analyzes data from the EHR as well as past claims to identify diagnosis codes that are missing from the current claim, and asks the provider if they still have the condition to see if the doctor simply forgot to document the code
   * CLOV's software also analyzes EHR and claims data to identify potentially missing diagnosis codes and asks the doctor if the patient ever had a certain condition using evidence-based guidelines
      * Example: blood pressure reading > 140/90 (threshold in hypertension guidelines) but no hypertension diagnosis code documented

&#x200B;

# 

# Why is CLOV Undervalued?

**Part 1: Hindenburg Report (February 2021)**

* Hindenburg does research for short hedge funds. The [report](https://hindenburgresearch.com/clover/) revealed a DOJ investigation into CLOV that was previously undisclosed. The day after the report was released, an SEC investigation was initiated into CLOV based on the report. The report had a number of unrelated claims on shady marketing practices, undisclosed business relationships, and ""upcoding"".
* Probably the most serious accusation of them all is the one about ""upcoding"". If this is true, it's Medicare fraud. The number one rule in the Medicare industry is DON'T OVERBILL MEDICARE. In the case of CLOV, I seriously doubt there is any upcoding going on based on how their software works. The Clover Assistant (CA) software doesn't have the ability to change any codes. It just makes recommendations. The doctor has to manually do it for regulatory *and* patient safety reasons. There are other population health tools out there that do this exact thing. Often times when upcoding is being investigated, it's because the Medicare fee-for-service claims suggest a much lower risk score. However, that's because providers don't document most codes in fee-for-service claims because they don't get paid to spend the extra time. When the patient then enrolls in a MA plan or DC program, all of a sudden [their risk score shoots up](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20170519/NEWS/170519815/doj-s-medicare-advantage-lawsuits-investigations-likely-to-change-insurance-culture) because the MA/DC organization and provider get paid based on risk.
* Regarding the other accusations, [CLOV released a point-by-point response](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000119312521029637/d66346dex991.htm) the day after the report came out. I thought they addressed everything sufficiently. From an investor's perspective, it all comes down to what the DOJ finds. I'd be very surprised if Chamath's counsel and the third-party counsel involved in the SPAC ignored or did not look into illegal practices during due diligence. This was one of Chamath's first SPACs and he knew was launching many more. If you mess up due diligence once, the rest of your SPACs become worthless.
* **Regarding the BS about the CEO Vivek Garripali**, he bought 3 hospitals in bankruptcy and assumed their debt almost 10 years ago. He quickly found out why they were in so much debt. The health insurance companies offer such limited coverage and almost exclusively to high income neighborhoods. So, if their insuree visited a hospital or clinic or anything outside of their coverage area, the insurance company would refuse to pay the hospitals fees or only agree to paying a small portion. So the medical facility ultimately ends up assuming the debt and this eventually snowballs. Anyways. Vivek began charging these insurance companies high premiums on the accounts he could collect on in an attempt to make up for the losses for patients they wouldn't pay for. This is where they try and paint him as a villain. Long story short. He sold the the hospitals and created Clover Health in order to solve this corrupt problem throughout the health insurance industry. For his time and money invested. He didn't make money as much as he learned from this experience. So a big part of Clover's mission is offering widespread coverage to their insurees. These big insurance companies are hating this. Hence much of the hate for Clover.

&#x200B;

**Part 2: DC Enrollment Numbers (May 2021)**

* CLOV announced their initial Direct Contracting (DC) enrollment numbers in their most recent quarterly report. The 65,000 DC patients were far below the 200,000 that the market was expecting. There was obviously a miscommunication between CLOV and the market. CLOV stated they had *access* to 200,000 Medicare patients through their network of 1,800 providers using their software. Analysts took that as a projection of enrollment. They still have access to all those patients and will enroll them over time. My guess is they were able to do [claims-based alignment](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/direct-contracting-summary) for much of the initial 65,000 DC patients, which is automatic. Now they have to market this program to the other $135,000 DC patients to get them enrolled via [voluntary alignment](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/direct-contracting-summary) (i.e. consent). They could also market the MA plan which has more benefits. That's the power of CLOV having a network of providers contracted with its DCE and MA plan.
* This lower DC patient enrollment has now been priced in with analysts adjusting down to an average price target of [$9.33](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CLOV/research-ratings). These price targets are based on extremely conservative enrollment projections and revenue projections from CLOV for their DC business.
* They set forecasts at 70,000 to 100,000 by end of 2021. *They already have 65,000 enrolled in April*. They intentionally set expectations extremely low to absorb the negative market reaction upfront and then outperform going forward. They also reported extremely low revenue projections for the DC patients. They're only projecting [$20M - $30M](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-health-reports-first-quarter-2021-financial-results) for the year.
* I would guess that their **profits** from the DC market this year could be $25M+ (5% margin x 65,000 patients x $850 x 9 months). Revenue should be similar to Medicare Advantage at $850+ per patient per month. That's at least $55M in Medicare payments per month for 65,000 DC patients.
* They did state that ""[GAAP revenue estimates for Direct Contracting are dependent on the finalization of accounting treatment, which we expect will be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2021](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-health-reports-first-quarter-2021-financial-results)"".

**Part 3: Differentiation**

* CLOV does have a virtuous cycle built into its business. It's all based on their relationship with their provider network. When they contract with a healthcare provider, they give them access to the Clover Assistant (CA) for free. CA is a software platform that analyzes electronic health record (EHR) and claims data to provide decision support back to the provider at the point of care.
* The CA platform is a population health tool. There are competing software solutions in the market. The difference here is that the provider has to pay for access to those tools. CLOV pays the provider to use the CA platform. CLOV pays **$200** per visit, which is much higher than the average [$121.45](https://truecostofhealthcare.org/medicare_part_b/) that other MA plans pay.
* The reason that CLOV pays the provider to use it is because it improves the top and bottom line for CLOV. CA helps providers make better treatment decisions and document risk scores more accurately, which results in higher Medicare payments (to CLOV and the provider). Higher Medicare payments directly increases the top line revenue. Better treatment decisions lead to lower costs, which allows CLOV (MA plan or DCE) to keep more Medicare dollars. If you're interested in how CA works, I'll include some bulletpoints at the bottom of the post.
* **Happy providers are key to increasing the number of lives managed long term.** Providers are directly involved in the ""alignment"" process for DC enrollment, and their opinion is highly respected when making a recommendation around which MA plan a patient should choose. As CLOV grows its provider network, it will increase enrollment for both MA and DC. It will also lead to more CA software users, more software users usually leads to better experience and insights, which could reinforce itself and bring more providers onboard.

# Risks to CLOV

Below are the biggest risks I see for CLOV, in order of importance:

**1.** **DOJ Investigation**

As I mentioned above, I don't think there were illegal practices going on at CLOV that management, Chamath, or the third-party counsel were aware of. It's still possible the DOJ investigation finds something. This happens all the time in the Medicare industry, including to the biggest names ([UnitedHealth, Humana,](https://www.whistleblowerattorneys.com/blog/whistleblower-unitedhealth-medicare-advantage-fraud) [Cigna](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/doj-cigna-medicare-advantage-fraud-lawsuit/583023/), etc.).

All the MA plans learn from each other's missteps. CLOV has been operating an MA plan for over 5 years now. They were [fined $106,095 in 2016](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payer/cms-fines-clover-health-for-misleading-marketing-tactics) for 'misleading' marketing tactics. *They haven't been fined since*. They have also gone through multiple rounds of funding from top venture capitalists and Google. There's been no shortage of due diligence on this company.

Yet, there is always the risk that someone somewhere was doing something illegal this time. If that is the case, it will likely end up in a lawsuit. I've seen many cases get to this stage and then get dismissed by a federal judge ([UnitedHealth 1](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/antifraud/unitedhealthcare-medicare-advantage-fraud-suit-department-justice), [UnitedHealth 2](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payer/department-justice-unitedhealth-medicare-advantage-fraud), ). Worst case scenario for the company, there is a settlement. Here are examples of MA plans paying settlements for ""upcoding"" fraud cases:

* UnitedHealth (2017): [$32M](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/antifraud/florida-insurers-pay-32m-to-settle-medicare-advantage-fraud-case)
* Kaiser Permanente (2020): [$6.3M](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/medicare-advantage-provider-pay-63-million-settle-false-claims-act-allegations)
* Humana (2021): [$12.5M](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/payer-issues/humana-roche-settle-false-claims-lawsuit-for-12-5m.html)

The largest settlement ever was [$270M](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/medicare-advantage-provider-pay-270-million-settle-false-claims-act-liabilities) by HealthCare Partners (now part of UnitedHealth) in 2018. This was because the providers themselves were submitting false codes (not the health plan). All of these settlements are for ""upcoding"". Again, among all the accusations, I would be most surprised if CLOV was actually doing this. If anything, the Clover Assistant should result in better documentation around the codes because that's what it's designed to do.

No matter how cynical a view you want to take on the DOJ investigation, CLOV has no debt and $700M in cash from the SPAC proceeds, so a settlement should not significantly impact them.

**2.** **SEC Investigation**

The SEC investigation was announced the day after the Hindenburg report came out. The SEC is investigating whether the DOJ inquiries were material enough to require disclosure to the market. The investigation may not be closed until the DOJ inquiries have been resolved. If the SEC determines there should have been a disclosure, there will likely be a fine. I'm not an expert on SEC enforcement. The only thing I could point to would be the $20M fine Elon Musk paid for announcing a fake acquisition at a much higher price at the time. He picked $420 as the fake number, not sure why...

**3. Market Multiple**

Valuations based on profitability could be hurt in the short term. Medical costs are higher this year due to delayed care during COVID-19, so all companies in this space will have compressed margins in the short-term. I believe growth is more important than profitability in this market when you're looking at <1% of DC patients enrolled. CLOV has proven to be exceptional at growth and has proven it both in MA and now DC.

There could also be a general downturn in market sentiment, and these growth stocks with low margins would be affected the most. However, Medicare is a very stable business and these companies will continue to grow independent of economic conditions.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# The Meme-Stock Correlation, Short Interest, and Gamma Squeeze setup

To keep this short and sweet - CLOV was originally identified by WSB & Stocktwitters for the short interest being reported over 100% at one point.  This is due to several miscalculations but the idea is true that SI is not being correctly reported.  It is estimated to be over 50% but is reported around 40% on Ortex.  This has been the main area of interest in relation to meme stocks.

# How did CLOV get caught up in all the meme madness?

Well..  if you dont remember, back in January, chamath palihapitiya encouraged retail investors, along with elon musk, to buy and SQUEEZE GME + AMC.

[GME squeezes from 60 to over 150 the next day on this Tweet](https://preview.redd.it/quoosh9nup371.png?width=1176&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a0b3d8969d37920eee6947d97ac8585eaea345d)

[but this helped too](https://preview.redd.it/qucv5j9tup371.png?width=1182&format=png&auto=webp&s=88e306406085ab9fc59d787bd3ab2381a52df689)

He made himself an enemy of hedgefunds who lost on these bets.  So when they doubled down their shorts on gme / amc - they went after chammaths stock, CLOV.  But they fucked up.  They doubled down and shorted it to shit because they lost money because of him.

With great fundamentals, **the short thesis is based on one thing alone - the HindenTurd report -** and guess what that is?  bullshit.

# 

# Did you mention Gamma Squeeze??

yes I did.   I even googled it for you apes.

https://preview.redd.it/9zj5oopi54471.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=61a66d109aec1738dece49345df43c974a18bc04

So basically, look at the **open interest** on each Strike.  Each new strike that goes in the money has to get hedged.  So basically multiply the open interest x 100 for each strike.  

[woops..  well we got them all in the money lol, so now we wait for shorts to cover... \(edit\)](https://preview.redd.it/is8dlv9ewp371.png?width=1576&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8053c02d47b4b92c351b11b47875a53adb94cd9)

* Is a Gamma Squeeze possible?
   * Yes.
* is a Short Squeeze possible?
   * Yes.
* Will either of the above happen?
   * IDK.
* but someone paid to see the FINTEL short squeeze score, its 93 / 100

[since short sellers are all under water now that the price is at ATH..  if they get margin called, it will take 5 days to cover, 5 days of pain, 5 days of gain.](https://preview.redd.it/yufdby0b54471.jpg?width=288&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=332cfdb2c0b9f4ddd09eecd4979f964b2a221d2b)

&#x200B;

# TLDR:

* **Should be between 15-22$ at current valuation.**
* Clover Health is basically Medicare insurance for old people meets AI tech (the clover assistant for doctors) it‚Äôs a huge healthcare disruptor.
* They have 45+% year over year growth, zero debt, 700 mill in cash, 105% institutional ownership with a super low float..
* 30$ IS EXPECTED for the CEO to ever profit... and chammath said it‚Äôs a 10x in 10 years company.
* Shorted to oblivion by Hindenburg & short sellers who attacked this one in particular because Chamath encouraged amc / gme retail interest..
* Short interest is likely above 50% and it seems to have a gamma squeeze setup in the options chain.
* The short thesis is based on the HindenTurd report which is based on some üåà üêª shit.

# CATALYSTS FOR PRICE ACTION:

* June 25. Russell 2000 index inclusion, will force 70 million in shares purchased for ETF's that track it.
* further discussion of reduced Medicare age or related
* public announcement Clearing of the DOJ / SEC inquiries.. ***this ones HUGE for fucking up the short thesis at its core...***
* future earnings & enrollment #‚Äôs, (every time they beat numbers will be great...)
* clover assistant updates
* I‚Äôm sure other things like great PR will eventually come out hopefully more from Chamath and the Clinton.

But based on the Ortex data below and today's price action, it feels like shorts CudReallybFuk and this was just the begining.

If we see a bunch of buying in the pre-market and the ticker gaps up at the open, we're almost assuredly gonna be destroying a few more shorts and forcing them to cover.

And that's gotta be fucking terrifying to them, because they know if they can't drive the price back down between now and June 17th, this thing could go parabolic. Why? Because they know we already had multiple catalysts coming down the pike that were expected to pop the stock price to some extent.

We ask that you vanquish the demons who've been betting against Canoo and all the other meme-stocks by forcing them to cover the hundreds of millions of shares they've used to artificially depress the stock prices of our beloved companies, thus raining the billions they once held, down upon our entire primate family.

281,OG,nr3jmz,2021-06-03 05:13:40,Rite Aid ( $RAD ) : One of the Next Meme Stocks to Soar is a Former WallStreetBets OG Favorite,"As meme stocks continue to melt up higher, an old meme favorite from the past is ready to join in on the fun --- That stock is Rite Aid ( RAD ).

**Some Basic Information**

* Rite Aid has only 55 million shares outstanding. Of those, approximately 57.75% are held by institutions and insiders.
* There are 7,860,000 million shares short or about 14.3% of the total outstanding shares. Those familiar with RAD know that it has been a target of short sellers for years who have tried desperately (but failed) to push the company into bankruptcy.
* The company had annual revenue of $24 Billion last year and is projected to hit $25 Billion this year.
* Despite having $24 - $25 Billion in annual revenue, Rite Aid's market cap is barely above $1 Billion.
* The stock price broke above $20 per share on June 2, 2021. The 2021 high share price thus far is $32.48, achieved back in January.
* The company is expected to turn the corner this year and report positive net earnings for the full fiscal year.
* The long-term debt is approximately $3.1 Billion
* Rite Aid achieved positive free cash flow last year and will do so again this year.
* Earlier this year, RAD completed an acquisition of Bartell Drugs for just under $100 Million, making Rite Aid the #1 pharmacy in Seattle.
* Rite Aid is the #3 retail pharmacy in the USA behind CVS and Walgreens.
* In 2018, Walgreens acquired 1,923 Rite Aid stores for $4.4 billion in cash. Rite Aid now has more than 2,500 retail stores today.
* Some analysis done on Rite Aid has projected that the breakup value of the company is in the range of $39 - $50 per share. (example - [https://www.reddit.com/r/RiteAidInvestor\_RAD/comments/m7haju/rite\_aid\_no\_matter\_how\_you\_cut\_it\_it\_is\_the\_right/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RiteAidInvestor_RAD/comments/m7haju/rite_aid_no_matter_how_you_cut_it_it_is_the_right/) )

**Impact of Coronavirus Vaccination Program and Future Contribution of Other Vaccines**

One significant contributor to Rite Aid‚Äôs financial improvement on the current fiscal year results will be the coronavirus vaccine distribution program. Rite Aid is an official participant in the US government‚Äôs Federal Retail Pharmacy Program for COVID-19 Vaccination. The US government dramatically increased the reimbursement rates for pharmacies administering the coronavirus vaccine to $40 from $28 for a single dose.

At the rate of vaccination projected, it is fair to estimate that Rite Aid will administer approximately six (6) million doses of COVID-19 vaccine during the first half of its 2022 fiscal year alone. Using the government reimbursement rates, the six (6) million doses will likely generate $230 million in revenue for Rite Aid and contribute approximately $2 per share in net profits. While the initial vaccination program will likely be completed during Rite Aid‚Äôs fiscal first half, the COVID-19 vaccine boosters are likely to become an annual revenue / profit stream for Rite Aid, as the annual flu vaccine is today. The latest view from epidemiologists suggests that annual coronavirus booster shots will likely be required on an annual basis. The global spread of coronavirus variants such as the E484K mutation lend credence to this view. Furthermore, customers visiting their local Rite Aid for COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters will become aware and take advantage of the fact that the retailer also offers nineteen (19) other vaccines, including flu, pneumonia, chicken pox, HPV, hepatitis A & B, and meningitis among others. As a result, vaccine distribution will continue to play a role in Rite Aids retail pharmacy growth story.

Finally, with the rapid development of mRNA vaccine technology to address the COVID-19 pandemic, we can expect to see new vaccines hit the market to prevent a variety of different types of cancers and other life-threatenting / chronic diseases. Such vaccines would be added to the list administered by pharmacists at local retail stores such as Rite Aid, increasing the revenue and profit potential of such establishments.

**Potential for RAD to Be Acquired**

While Amazon is often mentioned as a suitor for Rite Aid, I actually believe that the highest probability of a buyout of Rite Aid would come from Walmart.

Walmart is already a leading player in the retail pharmacy / prescription drug segment, and the category is a strategic growth target for the company. However, Walmart has nowhere near the presence in the pharmacy sector of either CVS or Walgreens. In order for Walmart to become competitive in this space, they have to increase their size and scale. If Walmart let's Amazon step up and become the third largest player in retail pharmacy, it's game over. WMT needs to move into this third position and block AMZN from doing so.

A couple of the benefits of Walmart acquiring Rite Aid would be:

* Walmart would have double the purchasing power for prescriptions thereby lowering its overall drug cost, improving profitability
* All the goods sold in the front-end of the 2,500+ Rite Aid retail pharmacies are the same products Walmart sells in its own department stores. Once again, when you buy larger quantities you get lower prices. This is a fact of the business world that I know first hand.

Based on the above 2 points, Walmart would improve both its own existing margins and at the same time would improve those of the Rite Aid revenue through such an acquisition.

The Rite Aid PBM would help Walmart to capture much greater market share in the prescription market, thereby enhaning those gains even further.

If you look at Walgreens and CVS when they had approximately $25 - $30 billion in revenue, they were earning about $4 - 6 billion per year. Therefore, considering Walmarts expertise in running brick and mortar establishments, one could make the leap of logic that WMT would achieve similar profit levels. So an acquisition of RAD by Walmart essentially provides a 2-3 year payback on the investment.

**Conclusion - Potential for Share Price to Soar Higher this Summer**

Rite Aid is due to report its Q1 earnings for the current fiscal year on June 24, 2021. The stock is likely to rally back to its 2021 high of $32.48 as that date approaches.

Also, as meme stocks continue to soar higher, Rite Aid is likely to benefit from such market activity as well. With only 55 million shares outstanding, RAD could easily see an exponential run higher should retail investors once again take an interest in this former WSB favorite.

288,A,nw6lmm,2021-06-09 23:16:51,A quick DD on CLOV borrowing fee,"Since I saw a lot of misinformed comments in the daily threads, I figured I would share this information.

The current borrow fee rate for CLOV is 116.7% (https://iborrowdesk.com/report/clov). The borrow fee rate is not the short interest; that is the number of shares shorted. 

The borrow fee rate is the amount it costs per year to short a share, as shorting requires borrowing. To put it into perspective, for a costant price, a yearly borrow fee rate of 116.7% would imply a daily cost of paying 0.3197% of the value of the shorted share.

0.32% in the world of returns is a lot. 

Yesterday, the short interest rate on CLOV was 43.54% (https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1402368431291314177?s=20). This number might be lower now, as the borrowing fee rate depends on other factors (volatility, ease of locating shares) than just the supply available; shorts may have covered a bit. It will, however, not be a lot lower. What this implies is that for some 30%-50% of the number of shares available on CLOV, the shorts are paying 0.32% of the price of the share just for holding the position, every. single. day. 

The shorts are absolutely bleeding buckets. In fact, this situation, including the drop today, is incredibly similar to GME; I dare say even more so than AMC. Another great buy, support each other please.

I currently hold multiple call options comprising 19% of my portfolio, and that's only because GME takes up 60%.

Obligatory rocket emojis üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Edit: Since I made this thread I received a lot of good, confirming information, which I would like to summarize here:

- The short interest rate is currently at 50.42% according to Ortex.

- https://fintel.io/shortSqueeze model states CLOV is currently most likely to squeeze.

- questrade Canada also has a borrow fee of 59%.

- Additionally https://www.shortsight.com/ shows that CLOV has a bullish sentiment with a low share availability score of 4, meaning shares are confirmed really limited across the board. This means multiple brokerages are confirmed to have a hard time locating shares. That is huge. Remember what caused GME to not be allowed to be bought anymore? Borrowing fee rates were high for a ton of brokers, and some, including IBKR and Robinhood, had these high borrowing rates in place because they were running out of shares to locate. They could no longer provide the shares they are obligated to provide to those who either want to short or buy the share. And hence they shut both down, as otherwise the brokerages themselves would trigger an insane and instant shortsqueeze. An incredible indicator.

Real talk, I'd like to reintroduce you to the deep value gaming market stock the world seems to have forgot about (something institutional bears & short sellers have taken full advantage of...and I will explain why)

I've been bleeding out on FDs in sideways trading hell on this for too many months and its about time everybody opens their eyes to the reality this play...and start reaping the inevitable rewards.

In the shadow of the $AMC mega-gains, you might overlook $CRSR's respectable 7% lift this week.  But this movement is actually the sign of a fuse thats just been lit.

I shouldn't have to give most of you too much introduction on the company itself. Corsair was founded in 1994, and has since become one of the global leaders in PC gaming hardware and peripherals.  The company IPO'd last September at \~$15 and made a heroic run up to almost $51 before retreating into a seemingly never-ending sideways cycle. 

The company is 100% legit, it has a proven track record in an exploding industry. Yet‚Ä¶it‚Äôs been almost completely overlooked for sexier tech plays. And the institutional bears have been taking full advantage of that. 

This stock is a red-hot ember being pissed on by bears artificially holding the price down, just waiting for kindling to light. That kindling is volume. When it makes a run, it is going to double  almost instantly. 

# Rockstar Fundamentals

Whether you care about the F-word or not, Corsair has been an incredible buy opportunity. Even before the pandemic their revenues and profits were growing.

CRSR is on track to exceed $2bln revenue this year, more than doubling 2019 sales.  Profitability margins have been increasing every year since IPO

They have plenty of cash in the tank, and have been paying down debts. Its held 5% by Insiders, and a whopping 77% by institutional investors.

https://preview.redd.it/r6tc7coxn3371.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=26e7364054a60f1b492cfcbd2b1fb672c1a77ab6

&#x200B;

The company isn't a one-trick pony. Aside from dominating some hardware sectors like Memory, Corsair has been making strategic acquisitions in the streaming space (most notably scooping up Elgato.)

By all accounts, Corsair is making all the right moves and is currently firmly in undervalued territory.

# Months of sideways strangulation by FUD-bears and Shorts.

$CRSR investors have endured many months of maddening sideways trading. For the first few months it seemed like it was trading with the market...and that investors were just waiting to see what happened with some upcoming news.

But after releasing good news after good news, the stock has continued to stagnate, and bounce around in completely unnatural intraday boom/bust cycles. Almost on queue swinging -2% to +2% to -2%  every day.

The reason for this is due to a mix of a very **low float and ridiculously low volume.** These two factors have allowed swing traders and institutional short sellers to play this stock like a fiddle.

CRSR has just **92 M** shares outstanding, and  **26.51M** shares in the float.  Most of the shares are held by institutions.

Short interest has been hovering around 20%. Which is high on its own...but doesn't tell the full story. Big pocket institutions have been selling tens of thousands of shares short in the AM, then covering intraday.

With the low volume, it doesn't take much to push the price down substantially without much ammo.

The big boys have been writing calls / buying puts, and then using shorts and their own holdings to push  the price down before exercise.

Meanwhile, bears have been spreading FUD throughout the investment world about CRSR on 3 primary points. None of which have actually come to fruition.

1. **CRSR is a ""Pandemic Play"", and gaming will magically disappear after things return to normal.**   This is the biggest boomer bs. The pc gaming and esports industries have been absolutely exploding over the last few years. Not to mention the streaming space which has been growing independently of it.  CRSR sales are cyclical like every retail company, but Q1 sales showed no signs of slowing.   Gaming is not going anywhere.
2. **THE SPOOOOKY Lockup period will cause millions of shares to flood the market.** There was tons of FUD spreading about 14 million IPO shares that would become unrestricted for sale back in March. People were convinced that these shares would flood the market instantly and tank the price.  But the lockup period came and went, almost no shares were actually sold.
3. **The global supply chain shortages means CRSR will not be able to grow.**  True, the microchip shortage is a threat to CRSR, but its also a threat to every other company in that space. What they've announced in their reports is that they had MORE DEMAND THAN THEY COULD FULFILL. That is not a bearish signal.  Despite the supply chain woes, CRSR sales dramatically beat expectations...showing they adapted and overcame this issue.

You may also be interested that the latest to join the short party is our good friends at Shita-del, making a short play at the end of May.

# The 59% Earning Beat everybody ignored

While some were expecting lackluster Q1 21 results as the pandemic wanes and supply chain issues rage on, in the May 2021 earnings release CRSR subverted all expectations. They beat estimates by an incredible 59%.  If anybody needed proof positive CRSR could weather the FUD, this was it.

But despite the stellar report, the stock actually DROPPED on the earnings report, and never recovered.

You might be saying ""of course the stock dropped, every tech stock drops on earnings"". Yes, this is true, IF there is a runup in the share price before the announcement. But in this case, there was no runup...the stock had been stagnant and even declining before the announcement.

This is when every retail CRSR holder knew this stock was not making natural movements, it was being intentionally held down.

By every logical account, the stock should have lifted in the weeks following the Q1 results. And because it didn't, the market has been ignoring CRSR due to the very effective FUD campaigns and short seller.

But this also means that the stock has entered deep into undervalued territory.

# LOW FLOAT VOLUME ROCKET

Given all the drama, why should you be looking at this stock? Because the same factors that bears have been using to hold this stock down are exactly what will cause it to take off.

**ALL $CRSR NEEDS TO BLOW IS A LITTLE MORE VOLUME**

The big bears have written calls and puts stacked around the $30-$35 strikes out through the EOY

https://preview.redd.it/t0ujqgdnn3371.png?width=973&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a506a07911ed26f5cbef6624b56a4717068089c

As soon as there is enough positive momentum on this thing from retail, the bearish trading strategies will become ineffective. They will lose a ton of money.

# Breaking Out

CRSR just hit $35/shr today for the first time since early March. This might not seem like much, but its the spark we needed.

I will reiterate, all this stock needs to pop is slightly more positive volume. This stock is poised to blow up fast and hard.  The float is too small, the short-selling tactics will not work when this thing makes a run.

At the moment it can be moved with only about 50k shares volume....averaging under 2 million total volume per day. If the volume increases >2 million or so in a multi day period, its going to run.

As CRSR continues its exceptional performance, it's only a matter of time before it breaks free from the cycle, and it looks like it will happen sooner than later. When it does happen....the shorts will crumble.

\*\*TL;DR\*\* A few thousand more people buy $CRSR the rocket gonna go Pop

Edit-My suggestions of buying $200 July strikes would have netted 300% on options since this was posted. To the moon!

 -üöÄMexico/US P3 trials and Price outlook üöÄ-
Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days probable, end of June worst case) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July-August for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent or close to Moderna.  Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects)  Chart on Contracts nvax has and what future prices/MC is expected to be is down below in the ""DD literature section"" at the bottom



-üöÄ Intro to Protein and mRNA type VaccinesüöÄ -
Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

             
                           
-üöÄDifferences how Protein vs.mRNA vaxs worküöÄ -
Imagine if the whole spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize it to understand the whole picture, and helps modify your Messenger RNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates  one piece of that picture it can still recognize the virus due to being able to see various other parts of the picture. In the mRNA method using one portion of the picture as virus mutates,  it becomes easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine ... that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. .... And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein.



-üöÄ Safety, Side Effects, and Adjuvenants  üöÄ-
 Every vaccine uses what's called an adjuvenant. This basically boosts the vaccines effectiveness. There's different kinds, and every company uses one in their vaccine. Not all are created equal. What makes Nvaxs adjuvenant (called Matrix M) so special is its the only plant based (soapbark tree) adjuvenant out there, and is the least irritating. This adjuvenant has been tested on pregnant women in the past and pases with the flying colors. mRNA adjuvenant vaccines use common molecules found in viruses and bacteria that stimulate our immune system. This approach has not been fully tested on pregnant women long term. One of the most common types that were used in the past were aluminum salts. They were found not to be ""harmful"" but we also didn't know enough about them and how they affect us on a grander scale. A lot of anti-vaxxers are against aluminum salts and giving it to the children. This is why Nvax will be the perfect solution for anti-vaxxers, children and the eldery that want something completely safe. Just using the term plant-based in a vaccine adds a good connotation, let alone the stronger protection/immune responce it provides. As far as what the virus is grown in,  Nvax uses a moth based formula. So it's insect and plant-based. Sounds like the Karen's will love this! Ultra safe. 


Adjuvenants work by creating an irritation/inflammation at the injection site, This in turn helps the vaccines be more effective apon administration. This is what makes you feel sore after getting a vaccine and specifically amount of adjuvenate that being used.  NVAX only needs to use 5mM vs  mRNA type vaccines use anywhere from 50 to 100 mM of adjuvenant. Therefore when getting a mRNA type vaccines you get a much stronger side effect due to the large amount being used. This is proof how effective nvax is because they need to use so little to be to get a strong immune response. Hence why they have the best data and we're called a first in class vaccine. In conjunction with how much adjuvenant is being used you can also say it directly alters the safety profile. Use too much and you get too many bad reactions. This is why Nvax has one of the best safety profiles out there.Hands down üôå Bottom of my post is a link with a lot of the data charted out that includes all the side effects of each vaccine charted.


 Lastly because the amount of ajuvenant used in mRNA type vaccines can only fit one maybe two strains max before throwing off the safety profile and risking not getting approval.  If they do use two strains they have to use less adjuvenant for both to combine them, meaning you're not going to get complete protection for each strain from the vaccine.  Nvax does not have this problem because of the such small amount they use, they could combine up to five different strains without an issue.... And right now with it being so clear that covid strains are going to keep mutating we need vaccines thay can cover multiple strains and give full protection on each one. Sometimes one strain can cover multiple strains but depending on where the strain mutates, a bad mutation will require addressing each strain individually and putting them together in one vaccine. Since you can't get four strains in one mRNA vaccine this puts us out at a clear advantage down the road when people need to do booster shots, and don't want to get multiple vaccines through the year.  So all in all it's clear Nvax adjuvenant separates itself from the pack and performs much better then other kinds on Safety, Effectiveness, Coverage of all strains and convenience of less shots in a given year.


-üöÄ Logistics and Storage.üöÄ -
Nvax can be stored in a regular refrigerator, and can be left out to sit out in room temperature for a while while you're vaccinating people. A special ultra low temp freezer is needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers. This is a majority of the world, not to mention the intricate ways you got to handle it so increases your distribution cost because you need special warehouses, dry ice etc. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

                 
- üöÄ Scientific conclusion üöÄ  -
So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). As of now Nvax elicits the strongest immune response out of any vaccine with the highest efficacy. Another thing that's really important to know is every trial is not built the same. Every company creates different end points for their trials. Some are looking for severe disease, some are counting everything mild, medium and severe. Nvax counted every single possible infection whether it was mild medium or severe. Case in point j&j didn't have very good efficacy in South Africa so what they did was they only counted the most severe cases so they could say that their vaccine works. (Great you won't die but you'll get so sick you wish you did).
 When looking at mild cases their vaccine didn't work very well. This is why it's always hard to tell apples to apples when you look at efficacy numbers because every trial is different. So you have to look at the devil in the details. 


It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines. This puts other competitors far behind us, giving nvax a economic moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing! They teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy which of P3 is the same it's good enough for approval). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine, and phase 3 is already complete and now they're moving on for approval. They will running a trial on their flu and covid combo vaccine, and once launched they could double the price of current covid vaccine due to being a 2 for 1. Moderna and Pfizer are also looking at a combo shot but they haven't even started trials yet. The problem is they can't even finish their trials because flu is non-existent right now so be very hard for them to get trials done for a long time. 



 -üöÄ Investment Thesis & Financials  üöÄ-
Nvax is pretty much de-risked at this point vs where they were a year ago. Yes you could buy other biotechs that can go up 20x, but they are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up, generally takes years for companies to get to this point if not decades.) They have all successful trials, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment; where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place, there are no more issues or glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""


They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. The before Memorial day weekend on one trading day before market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close.  Representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 


A link for future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract is at the bottom of the post in DD literature section. It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June, anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 



 -üöÄMy Positions üöÄ -
As far as my position I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $4.06, I panicked and sold once during February a couple months during the mini bear market and got back in a bit too early so got a wash sale as well üôà but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG  (Check out next link below this paragraph, it has My positions with the price chart mentioned above. My screen name on stocktwits is Johnnyknowsbest. Been on there and here since i started with nvaxz feel free and drop a follow if you want up to date info. But honestly the whole board is worth following there's so much good DD on there, we have a really strong tight knit group of longs that help each other with DD. 


Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO, where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June, but he said he thinks it could be earlier.  So sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

Sup, honorable apecitizens! Recently I‚Äôve been working on this fascinating piece of TA, and now I am finally ready to share that with [you](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/msv8n1/tbh_i_only_trust_retards/). I am so confident in it, that I dared to put my beard (which I have for five years already) on the line! Worth your full read, I promise! I decided to structure the analysis in the following way: first we'll take a look at the VW short squeeze, revisiting its origins and background as the very first step of the discussion - in order to better understand the fundamental context of TA; after that I'll lay down the main technical parameters and frameworks, through which the [GMESS](https://imgur.com/a/Sd4uE1b) thesis will be dissected, applying all of those to VWSS and explaining the TA core on the Volkswagen example; then, the process will be repeated, but this time TSLASS anatomy will be elaborated upon. Finally, all of the data accumulated in the process, as well as the major findings made, will be applied to the current technical state of GME, in order to construct at least a potential forecast and the probable price action. Buckle up and eat a crayon, let's start.

Oh, and one more thing! I really encourage you to dive deep into the ANALysis with me, because the thesis can only be understood if all of the technical factors at play are considered in the sharpest detail first - and then in the aggregate: zooming out and looking at the bigger picture through the prism of coincidences, interdependences and probabilities. Dafaq did I just write? - Dunno, but that's exactly what I meant!

# Volkswagen - Das Short-Squeeze: Sep 2007 - Mar 2009

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Remember, when VW became the most valued company in the world for a brief wild period of trading? I bet, Pepperidge apes remember. The squeeze played out right in the midst of the global financial crisis, and such an occurrence was fueled by a curious background scenario, orchestrated largely by one very interesting person. Back then, the former President of Porsche, Wendelin Wiedeking (must be a cousin of Battlefield Counterstrike), was pursuing a goal of taking over Volkswagen. In this process, he used cash-settled options to circumvent the transparency and disclosure of Porsche‚Äôs market operations. While being acquired by Porsche, Volkswagen had its ordinary shares premium risen to disproportionately high levels compared to its preference shares.

As the general public was finding out about Wendysking‚Äôs takeover plan, hedge funds and particularly short-sellers set their eyes on the fact that Volkswagen‚Äôs preferred shares were traded at a significant discount to the ordinaries (approximately 70%). While the price of the ordinary stock gradually increased, the preferential shares stayed put - and the hedge funds smelt an arbitrage opportunity. They started shorting the stock and buying the preferred shares to profit on the massive divergence. For a moment, there was no news of Porsche continuing its purchase of VW ordinaries from the market, and that fact gave the hedge funds additional confidence. Only to get blindsided, as it turned out later. One shorts-frying weekend, Porsche announced its total holding in VW, cornering the substantial part of the float, and leaving only 6% in free float. In the meantime, short sales had risen to 12% of total stock outstanding. When the market found out that Porsche had acquired 74.1% of the outstanding shares through the in-transparent cash-settled options, VWSS happened - briefly making Volkswagen the largest company in the world, and finally allowing the shorting side to [GUH](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpnzup/i_recorded_todays_marketopen_and_the_instant/):

&#x200B;

>It was mathematically impossible for every short-seller to buy a share, and therefore close their position. In other words, half the room were going to be left in a burning building with no way out. A panicked dash for the exit began.

&#x200B;

‚Äî A spot on metaphor by Jamie Powell, an FT journalist. Hedge funds are estimated to have lost $20 to $30 billion by betting against VW ordinary stock.

What is really ironic (in Palpatine voice) - even though Porsche managed to burn many short sellers, the company couldn‚Äôt pay up for the huge positions it had created, and ended up being acquired by VW instead.

Also, interestingly enough, after his departure from Porsche, Wiedeking was charged with market manipulation for his role in the takeover bid. The charges were dropped in July 2016 due to a too little chance of success. Lucking Fegend.

&#x200B;

**Now let‚Äôs take a look at how this epic event was incorporated into the chart:**

[VWSS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/d3pfzvb202z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e497ddf6518faec188269120c44df64ab6cb1791)

Even though it all looks overwhelming from the first glance, don't worry, I'll explain. There are only two major TA instruments used here, namely Fibonacci retracement üåàtool (useful for assessing 'altitude' and the crucial support/resistance levels, check out the in-depth explanation of this TA tool [in my other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mwevzz/the_big_short_20_why_bears_may_soon_reconsider/)). The second one is the trend based Fibonacci extension for time periods (pink vertical grid with numbers 0, 0.382, 0.618 and so on) - for setting the major time landmarks and zones. Furthermore, you should have noticed the three catchy geometric figures, and the purple line - which is actually a good starting point to unfold the technical thesis.

In the process of working with VW, TSLA and GME charts, I managed to identify several peculiar characteristics and patterns, that were of an evident nature and have been manifested on all of the three charts, to one degree or another. The most prominent one, in my opinion, is the killer purple resistance/support level. For the current VW example, it is somewhere around $30 mark, or $29.27 if you like precision.

One may observe on the chart above, that this level is indeed the most significant level through the complete history of VWSS. First, the preliminary to the squeeze major bull run, which solidly accelerated in the middle of September 2007, was held back and repulsed by this level's resistance on the last day of October. It took almost half a year for the price action to catch up to it again in late March 2008. This was followed by a consolidation (with several failed attempts of breakout) just below this level, which lasted for more than 100 days, before the price action finally torn the resistance apart with the powerful gap on the 16th of July '08. And guess what? Even after that, the level played the major supportive role for the price action, with one final retest before the squeeze finally lift off it in the middle of September 2008. You should also make a note of how the price was still magnetized by this level during the final stages of the squeeze. The signifficance of this price level for the whole chart of VW above is difficult to underestimate. Seeing the importance of this level and being a fan of Jimi Hendrix, I decided to name it ""**Purple Haze**"".

Let's inspect the fancy geometric shapes now. These are actually much more reasoned and circumspective than it may seem from the first glance. The first one, in orange, is a cup shaped consolidation (let it be called the ""**Squeezy Grail**"", because why not?) - taking place above 100% Fibo and just below the 'Purple Haze'  - which commenced as soon as this major resistance level had been tested for the first time. It is subsequently followed by the second consolidation of a flatter nature \[if you know what else is of a flatter nature, comment and if the joke is good enough I may give you an award\], which again plays around the main $30 level on the chart. The second consolidation, highlighted by the pink rectangle (a.k.a. the ""**Runway**""), is actually more important than the first one, because here is the point where the paramount breakout happens: the 'Purple Haze' resistance is blew off (in the middle of 0.382 period). Based on that observation, it is also appropriate to assume that in order for the squeeze to initiate, the 'Purple Haze' has to be conquered at some point inside 0.382 Fibo time zone, during the 'Runway' stage. Finally, the triangular ""**Squieezluminati Confirmed**"" part is self explanatory, imho. Oh, just one commentary worth being made here: take a look at how the squeeze itself is proportionate, bipartite, and fits well into the isosceles triangle. The nature surely knows how to play with stonks, too.

Especially, when we talk about Fibonacci. The horizontal üåà grid, Fibo retracement, is often used to estimate the possible corrective trend's depth, as well as to identify the key support and resistance levels of it. This one is comfortably applied to the beninging and the apex point of the trend (see the gray dash and dash line on the chart above), and its relevance is subsequently confirmed by how the price action plays around the levels in the triangle. The 12th of September '07 seems to be a good starting point for Fibo retracement application, because on that day another important resistance of $20.72 was penetrated for the first time (then confirmed as support with the beautiful bear trap candle on 23 Jan '08). Furthermore, $20.72 level works like an ideal 100% Fibo retrace level for the current example, and supports the 'Holy Grail' comparable to how my granny supports me. Also, take a note of the 'Purple Haze' being relatively in the middle, in between 78.6% and 100% of Fibo retracement - an important factor that will enable us to apply this retracement to GME later.

Not only the 12th of September fits well as Fibo retracement starting point, it is also a perfect spot to start stretching out the trend-based Fib time grid (TBFTG - to be fucked then go, alternatively). This one is a complex instrument, so take this quick explanation for granted or do your own research in relation to it. Just like Fibo retracement, TBFTG is based on Fibonacci sequence, but this one applies to time periods, instead of the price action and levels. In order to use this instrument properly, it is necessary to identify the preliminary major trend, that will serve as the core measurement for the sequent time periods. Oh, it took me a lot of time to inspect that parameter and to identify those initial pink dash and dash trends, trust me! Tbh, it was one of the most difficult tasks to accomplish in the preparation of this TA. But the result was worth the effort! I noticed the following correlation applicable to both VWSS and TSLASS (and hypothetically to GME too): TBFTG pink dash measurement must involve the major preliminary impulse of the prior main trend, plus 'Squeezy Grail' phase. The staring point of TBFTG is particularly tricky to be identified, and I'm talking about all of the examples, but possible - especially when looking at the TA as a whole, referring to how the grid applies to the price action, and comparing the examples between each other. That is pure rocket science, if you ask me. And most importantly, the TBFTG measurement duration (pink dash and dash trend) seem to be very similar in length to 'Squieezluminati' basis - check the bars measurements on all of the charts (blue lines for VW).

Pay attention to the following features, which really help to dissect the squeezes' anatomies and to build the suitable technical framework: *the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone; and the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, peaking at 1*; *TBFTG pink dash measurement includes major preliminary trend plus 'Squeezy Grail', as it has been mentioned above. Furthermore, the correlation in duration of TBFTG measurement and the triangle basis must once again be emphasized.*

Noice, but let's move further.

# Tesla, or how Elon Mask truly ‚Äúis become meme, Destroyer of shorts‚Äù: Apr 2019 - Apr 2020

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Tesla and the founder Elon Musk have confronted the short sellers on a regular basis, and even after the run-ins with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for now, the former have been winning. The TSLA shorters were sitting on mark-to-market losses of over $40 billion in late 2020, as the company‚Äôs shares exploded 740% last year. This information is based on data collected by Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, a fin-anal company.

Remember the not so distant in past Tesla 'mania'? The prospects of Tesla‚Äôs business and the furious opposition of bulls and bears, including famous fund managers like David Einhorn and Mark Spiegel (who still hold a strong opinion that TSLA is a house of cards ready to collapse), have over the years contributed to an extreme volatility in the stock price. Elon Musk openly criticized the short-sellers and their motivation to dig out and spread negative sentiment about the company. The 'taking Tesla private' play seemed to work out for the short-sellers as the stock price collapsed by about 50% from November 2018 to May 2019. After that, amidst Tesla‚Äôs opening of the Shanghai Gigafactory and the announcement of the company's first annual operating profit exceeding analyst expectations, the tables have turned and the bear-beaten TSLA shares skyrocketed in price (not without noble WSBetters help, definitely). Needless to say, that previously steady short-sellers started getting anxious and scrambled to cover their positions.

&#x200B;

Dusaniwsky told Institutional Investor (B2B media) that shorting Tesla is:

>The longest unprofitable short I‚Äôve ever seen!

&#x200B;

Well, Mr. Dusaniwsky, WSB seem to have an answer for everything:

https://preview.redd.it/h3l5hayu02z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecc69df97a282c4a22663e8487cf316488ed9d32

&#x200B;

While companies and founders often hold a scorn on short sellers, because they can bring down stock prices and cause the cost of capital to rise (or even do worse things, if you know what I mean), Musk‚Äôs disdain for the short selling community is unrivaled. In the middle of 2020, Musk took a dig at short sellers by releasing 'short shorts'. These now sell at a premium on Ebay. It's all nice and good, but I have another cool merch idea - '**shortz r fuk**':

[TSLASS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/f0qbrpqn22z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=479c78e6763043f81e9ac2c75cf8a6c769d9eee4)

&#x200B;

Beautiful, isn't it? Let's quickly run through the short squeeze anatomy checklist, thoroughly elaborated in the previous TA chapter via the example of VW. First things first, the 'Squeezy Grail' is present, but it resembles more of a V shape structure. Next, the 'Runway' stage is good-looking: a fucking massive gap happened there, and this time 78.6% Fibo level is tested during the 'Runway', being indicative of the TSLA bulls' crazy power. 'Squieezluminati Confirmed' is also really interesting here, as this time there is no isosceles triangle at its core structure, but rather a 'chainsaw'-like volatile price action taking place. Furthermore, you may see that inside of the triangle, there is the after-peak 78.6% Fibo zone retest, which in turn hedl and bounced the price back in the direction of... Moon. Blessed be the bulls!

Looking at the 'Purple Haze' (which is again in between Fibo 78.6% and 100% \[important!\]), for TSLASS the major price level manifested at $52.46. During the first half of 2019, this level played a role of a magnetizing support, with the subsequent testing in March and the breakout to the downside in late April. Again, a lengthy, half a year long consolidation is taking place just below this level, and above Fibo 100% retracement. The breakout occurs, you guessed, right in the TBFTG 0.382 zone. And what is really fascinating, is the fact that, after the breakout, the 'Purple Haze' has never been retested. But who knows what the future holds?

And the Fibos. The retracement, again, apples perfectly onto the complete squeeze structure: 78.6% is trialed several times; all of the upper levels except for 38.2% were broken with the subsequent retrace and and some with the retest. A particularly intensive price action was occurring for about two weeks near the 23.6% Fibo level, and the high of $189.4 level was penetrated and then touched gently during the initial squeeze. Ah, almost forgot, 100% ($35.75) Fibo level firmly holds the 'Squeezy Grail' in hand again.

Current TBFTG should be of an interest for fellow TAnaLyzators too. Particularly, the downtrend, as opposed to VW uptrend, serves as the core for TBFTG's application (again, refer to the dash and dash pinkish line). This core is composed of the pre-'Squeezy Grail' downtrend plus the Grail itself. Take a look at gray measurements, which cover this phase and the triangle duration - again these two follow the tendency of being proportionate in the length as phases. *Crucially, the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone again; then one more time the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, with the false first peak during the final stages of 0.618 and the proper peak at 1*.

Too many coincidences and congruences between the two TA examples discussed above, if you ask me. Especially if the fact that such events happen once in ten years or so is taken into account. Two quotes are of a relevance here:

&#x200B;

>Coincidences mean you're on the right path - *Simon van Booy*

&#x200B;

>If you gaze long enough into an asshole, the asshole will gaze back into you - u/roman_axt

&#x200B;

Some additional food for thought from TSLA:

[For redditors with a different floor](https://preview.redd.it/gnd0yienc2z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8b72e1671ad69cf871cde154ae386e52835e94a)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Game stopped, or it is just a beginning?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I am absolutely confident that you all know even more than myself about the fundamental factors at play for GME, so I will not bother you here with the background explanation. There is a plenty of good HQ DD all around reddit, so let's jump straight to the sweet sweet TA:

[GMESS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/ko1ppnasc2z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d3f7c2a78135696d66a0a70e8e2a34ad4a04dbf)

&#x200B;

At this point, I feel that a disclaimer is necessary. Let me briefly remind you that this analysis is a thesis, or a hypothesis that has to be proven in the future. I do believe that there is a solid probability for things to play out this way, and my beard supports my manly confidence. However, this is the market, and it all may go another way at any point in time, that's the nature of things! Think critically, learn and do your own DD and TA. In a good memory of u/ControlTheNarrative, at least.

And so, it begins. Despite it may seem that there are too many unknown or at least questionable variables for now in this GMESS TA, I believe that I was able to identify the most crucial parameters to build the core of this technical analysis's thesis, since VWSS and TSLASS provided many clues and identifiable characteristics to refer to. The first and most important one is surely the 'Purple Haze'. I should remind you, that this mystically sounding level persistently held back the price for both of the squeeze examples discussed, and only upon the breakout of this level the short squeezes were initiated. For GME this major price level seems to be at about $233 mark, with two intensive tests in Jan and Mar, which proved it to be the most significant resistance on the chart above.

Then, the shapes. The 'Squeezy Grail' (again occurring in between 78.6% and 100%) consolidation is also easily identifiable here, and it is yet again followed by the rectangular 'Runway' consolidation, where the price action currently stands. Remember, how historically (in TSLA and VW) the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurred somewhere near the spot of the current GME price action, in 0.382 Fibo time zone? Well, to paraphrase Ian Fleming: once is (VW) happenstance. Twice is (TSLA) coincidence. Three times is GMenemy action.

Fibos. Applying these two instruments to GME was real pain in the ass. Firstly, because the retracement is not usually used as a predictive instrument, being ordinarily applied to the completed trend. But since the situation is not ordinary at all, I played smarter (or more autistic, if you like). Due to the fact that the 'Purple Haze' level was approximately in between 78.6% and 100% Fibo in both of the previous examples, I assumed exactly that to be applicable here too. My belief is firmly backed up by this soft touch of 78.6% by the price action on Jan 28th. And when these two major levels were identified, the Fibo retracement horizontal grid just stretched out on GME itself.

Identifying the starting points for the trend for both Fibos was the most tricky part. After countless attempts and failures I found what I believe to be the cornerstone to the squeeze:

[Fibos' initiation point zoomed in](https://preview.redd.it/t2ouren1d2z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1cd87d96bb42ac20451c86059295f7560c8c44e8)

&#x200B;

Why? Because this                        ‚òùÔ∏è is clearly where the fun started.

And now it all matches perfectly. So, I am patiently waiting for the 'Purple Haze' to be broken. And what do you do, fellow retard?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They say, that coincidence doesn't happen a third time. I say, we shall see.

**TL;DR** is in the comments.

Well, it opened at $20. This pullback is normal and falls in place with expectations. Two major things I'd like to put out that I made in my post last evening:  
"" Tomorrow should if everything is reoccurring and following the trend, be a 30%+ day and probably the highest volume we've ever seen. ""  
We did just that. We hit $20 USD and the highest volume we've ever seen on a daily chart and there's still 1.5 hours left of trading left in the day. Expect a large momentum swing upwards during power hour.  
For all of you that are thinking about pulling out, don't. We haven't even lifted off yet, but we certainly are close.  
The majority of shares were traded at open, this means a large portion of people are sitting $18-$20 USD and will likely be accumulating more on this dip if they are wise.  
Tomorrow's expectation stands. The range will anywhere between $24.75 USD to $33 USD but it is impossible to tell at this point in the game.

Other things I would like to point out on the chart is whenever we've had large openings we have a strong tendency to trade lower than we opened.  
This is of the recent bull (crab) run:

So what I'm trying to say here is, don't be scared of the short term from what you see at open and what happens the rest of the day. The charts will look uncannily similar and so will our movements. BB has not reached its critical mass yet but god damn are these charts looking similar except we are exceeding volume and institutions have put a LOT more money in $BB under the $10 USD price point.

BB's pincer has only begun to take shape. BB still has a lot of room to grow.

I was watching this clip from this spooge-stain Rich Greenfield [here](https://youtu.be/Z9-jJNjdfCs). He said something that kinda surprised me as he bitched and whined about how stupid retail traders are.  First, he said the volume of trades is in the billions, so it's impossible that we are all holding.  That's funny, it sounds like he said the quiet part out loud.

More importantly, he said, ""the fundamentals don't support the valuation"". I'm stupid and don't know that word, so I turned my head sideways to listen at these weird sounds.  He then brought up Cinemark, which he says is ""the exact same company"".  The only differences he uses to separate the two are (1) Cinemark ""has a stronger balance sheet"" and (2) Cinemark is a $5b enterprise value while AMC is at $30b.  

So this stupid ape did some stupid monkey math and 30/5=6.  So far, I think I'm okay.  Now I did more stupid monkey math.  CNK stock price of $23 X 6 = $138 for AMC.  That can't be right, as AMC is trading at $48.

Here is where I'm really retarded and know nothing.  I looked at Market Cap.  It's a number I see all the time and don't know anything about it.  I look at CNK market cap and it is $2.56b.  AMC's market cap is $18.85 muthafuckin billion.  18.85/2.56= 7.36.  7.36X$23/share= $169.  One 69, which is what my wife will give me if this is all correct.

By now WWE should be on everyones tendie radar after today's outsized move on large volume (6x the normal daily volume). The combination of low float (\~44M), high short interest (18-22%) and the sheer number of extremely memeable wrastling GIFs set this one up to be one for the history books. The options chain is also primed to explode. I could easily see this running back to the old ATHs within the next few months.

On top of that we have the return of live events next month in Texas and potential buyout rumors floating around adding fuel to the fire. This summer is setting up to be big for McMahon and his merry crew of men in leotards, we should all profit from this greatly.

338,BYND,noprc0,2021-05-31 03:54:08,BYND,"The case for BYND

Improving fundamentals: It just received a double upgrade and now has two consecutive analyst upgrades. The total addressable market for BYND is potentially in the trillions of dollars: displacing animal-based beef, pork, eggs, cheese, and chicken. The World Economic Forum has argued that global meat consumption must fall within the coming years. According to Forbes, 60% of Gen Z is looking to base their diets on ‚Äúplant-forward‚Äù foods. 

BYND market cap‚Äôs only $10 billion. It‚Äôs growing like a weed. Yearly revenue growth for the past three is 131% compounded annually.  

And BYND might have a durable competitive advantage. According to analyst Alexia Howard, for BYND, ‚Äúas plant-based products tend to be relatively complex to manufacture, moats could prove to be deep.‚Äù Additionally, as of 2019, the company had one patent and 21 U.S. and international patent applications.  

It‚Äôs attempting to achieve price parity with animal-based meat in the next few years and ultimately even produce for cheaper. As the first-mover, it also has the potential to achieve economies of scale faster and become most attractive from a price standpoint. Its competitor Impossible Burger has had to turn down partnerships because it hasn‚Äôt had the infrastructure that BYND has and couldn‚Äôt produce sufficient product to service big partnerships. BYND‚Äôs further along and has been able to garner partnerships with the likes of KFC, McDonald‚Äôs, Starbucks, Pepsi, Pizza Hut. Impossible Burger also produces its food with GMOs, which are outlawed in many countries. BYND already sells products in 80 countries.  

Remember that the GME run started in 2020 with not only high short interest but attractiveness from a fundamental perspective that led big investors like Michael Burry and Ryan Cohen to move in aggressively. BYND has this fundamental attractiveness more than a lot of companies with a high short interest, which analysts are largely downrating.  

BYND‚Äôs growth took more of a pandemic-related hit than other food providers because much of its growth involves people buying their products in restaurants. It is, therefore, considered a re-opening play. 

BYND spends 7% of revenue on R&D, which is many times that of more mature food providers, so the future looks bright. 

High short interest: According to both MarketWatch and Ortex, BYND‚Äôs short interest is higher than AMC, BB, and GME. 

Favorable externalities: Good against global warming, good for animals, good for global resources, good for human health. This gives incentives to many influentials (celebrities, governments) to encourage people to consume plant-based meat. Governments have subsidized the electric vehicle industry. Will they do the same for clean meat?  

Cramer has suggested BYND as a WSB play to his 250,000 viewers during each of his last three Mad Money episodes (Tues, Weds, Thurs; no show Fri) and elsewhere on CNBC. A couple people here have suggested Cramer has done so as a distraction. I understand the bitterness toward hedge funds: They‚Äôre selling out, making a lot of money while not adding much to society. But Cramer‚Äôs offering insight to nonprofessional investors to help them make investing decisions. I just started watching Cramer again about a month ago and just about everything he‚Äôs liked most has moved up in value: Roblox, Ford, Wells Fargo. He has, in the past, consistently said favorable things about BYND and Ethan Brown. He‚Äôs even suggested in the past that going against BYND is going against history. 

And anyway, the proof is in the pudding: BYND short interest is higher than AMC, BB, and GME, according to MarketWatch and Ortex. And it would be a lot nicer for a company displacing animal meat to sell stock and get more capital for R&D than a cell phone or a movie theater company. 

I was following the market in 2013, and this situation reminds me so much of Tesla in May 2013. The stock started rising on fundamentals, and commentators thought it was highly priced and thought it was rising only due to a short squeeze. But electric vehicles were the future and Tesla kept rising for years, even though there was concern that big players would get into the industry. Beyond Meat is also the future and has the potential to rise even after the short squeeze, which is one reason institutional investors may be buying. BYND‚Äôs market cap of about $10 billion is also the same as Tesla‚Äôs when its run started in 2013 and commentators were scoffing at its valuation. Now it‚Äôs over $600 billion. 

This stock right now is potentially set up for a  strong run within the next few months: increasing bullishness of institutional investors, high short interest, and maybe the increasing support of WSB. It‚Äôs 40% below its all-time high. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it doubles in the next several months.  

Disclaimer: I‚Äôm not in any other squeeze plays. I will probably write covered calls on AMC and hedge with puts because their short-term calls are very highly priced. (This is a delta-neutral position that should not impact AMC share price.) I have BYND calls and may buy more because their short-term calls are still cheap.",DD,0.71

344,A,nq4abi,2021-06-01 22:51:51,"A forecasted potential earnings Breakdown for AMC, BB, &amp; ASO üòé from one dork to a bunch of retards","First things first, I hope you all understand that math is scientific, and these numbers will be pretty accurate but with all things finance sometimes assumptions must be made. The assumption being made here is that the stock market will react to AMC, BB, and ASO short squeezes EXACTLY as it did to GME. A true apples to apples comparison of what has happened to GME being applied to our other favorites.

Up first is teaching you how to calculate earning in the form of a percentage. The formula goes like this. (Current Value - initial Cost)√∑initial cost x 100= percentage return. 

GmE started at roughly 18$ before it gained squeeze worthy traction and eventually topped out at $483. I chose 18$ as the starting point t because earning up until that point were smooth and slowly trending upwards on a 1 year chart. GmE has 70 Million Shares outstanding. It's 18 to 483 dollars increase gives it a return of 2,583% roughly.

Applying this to AMC goes like this. AMC had a ""pre-surge"" stable price of 10$. 10x25.83=258$ however GME only has 15 percent of the shares outstanding that AMC has so you have to consider the market Cap. $258x.15%= $38.70 expected squeeze price. All variables being the same at its highest AMC could go to $38.70 

BB is going  to be very similar to AMC because of a large market cap. BB ""pre-surge"" stable price is $10 as well, this is being generous because a good argument could be made to use $8-9 but I decided to use 10. So 10x25.83=$258 however GME only has 12% of shares outstanding as BB so that has to be factored in 258x .12%= $30.96  I believe at the height of any BB squeeze due to market cap the price could soar as high as $30 using GME variables.

Here is where things get interesting ASO has a ""pre-surge"" stable price of $30 and GME has 77% of shares outstanding compared to ASO, a Much higher variable, with a much higher starting price, and a higher short interest than BB & AMC. Here we go 30x25.83= 775$ 
775 x.77= $596 squeeze price potential

So in essence we can triple our money or better on AMC & BB depending on when you bought in. AsO has the potential to be HUUUGGEüöÄüöÄüíØüòÉ",DD,0.78

Keep in mind technicals are not a crystal ball, they are a **road map.** I do not hold a position *(although if I looked at the chart Friday, I would).*

[$SPCE 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/c32m1rk5eq071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d477968e5afc2875bca36a471e1c77bd84adcbd)

Here you can see we **broke out of a large descending wedge on Friday** (with fantastic volume). This is the same pattern damn near every speculative growth stock has been caught in for the past few months. Normally it has a bearish bias - because it is coming from downside. However, in this scenario - **it broke up -** which means **we can see some fantastic follow through to the upside.**

The price targets for this setup would be **22.61, 26.18, 28.05, 29.71.** These are all resistances - and in a normal situation you would either trim as we run into these, or scale in as we clear them.

However - given the news catalyst - it's hard to say how high we will gap up on Monday. Above that last level is **34.84** and **36.63.** It's unlikely we cross these without an insane short squeeze, or another pattern forming (at least on the shorter term charts).

Remember, each time we clear one of these levels on a **daily close -** it will become a support. As a result, you can trail your stop loss below them as we continue.

This is one of many examples of **""technicals precede news""** I have encountered throughout my trading career - and one of the reasons I try to ignore anything except for the charts while I am trading. It's hard to quantify arbitrary events - and especially hard to do so without bias. Thankfully, we will often **break out of a major pattern prior to a news release -** like you see here.

I'll be looking to day trade this stock next week depending where we open.

***TL;DR*** \- $SPCE broke out Friday & has positive news to help it along next week

Price targets are **22.61, 26.18, 28.05, 29.71**

# Products & Customers

* BlackBerry isn't just a phone company any more. They provide best in class cybersecurity.
* BlackBerry's most notable product is QNX, an RTOS with several applications. [Read here for more.](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le53ol/comprehensive_guide_about_bb_and_how_it_shall/)
* In December of last year, Amazon announced a multi-year global agreement with BlackBerry QNX and developed IVY, a cloud-connected smart vehicle data platform. IVY allows automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data and create actionable insights from that date. It's possibilities are endless, and I highly recommend reading more on Amazon's initial announcement.
* OK, so what the fuck does the point above mean? It means that **right now, electric vehicles are a gold rush, and BlackBerry is the one selling picks and shovels.** Through Amazon, IVY is going to become an integral part of the EV process.
* The market is sucking the dick of EV manufacturers, but EV production is low margin and low scale. **BlackBerry IVY is data monetization, which is high margin and has unlimited scale.** Within a few years, BlackBerry will be making much more than the auto manufacturers they're partnered with.
* Blackberry QNX is used by 23 of the world's top 25 electric vehicle OEMs.
* BlackBerry targets more than just EVs though. They also have or are developing products for healthcare, financial services, government markets, energy, gas, oil, and smart grid connected transportation.

# Cybersecurity Leader

* BB offers best-in-class security, safety, and reliability. 18 of the G20 governments are customers, and they are the only software company to attain various security certifications from the US Govt.
* Ransomware attacks have begun to impact American businesses like never before. Today, the commerce secretary stated ransomware attacks are here to stay, and that businesses should plan accordingly.
* You know that oil pipeline that was taken out by DarkSide ransomware and caused oil shortages across the southeast U.S? That wouldn't have happened if Colonial Pipeline were using BlackBerry. Something tells me companies won't be making that mistake in the future.
* According to Frost & Sullivan Research, BlackBerry addresses 96% of cyber threats, and 77% of Fortune 100 financial companies use BlackBerry software.

[Here's a list of BB Certifications obtained in 2020.](https://preview.redd.it/qey899yxnp371.png?width=1259&format=png&auto=webp&s=f51e571ce7afcaf17126b2c168cb3f7a37343c35)

# Some Basics and Fundamentals

* BlackBerry has an \~$8bn market cap with $1bn+ in yearly revenue and $800m in cash.
* Since 2016, the number of QNX products has grown from 50 million to 175 million.
* BB owns \~38,000 patents worth approximately $450 million.
* BB recently won a lawsuit against Facebook. I am unable to find the details, but most estimates are for between $1bn - $5bn total, paid over the course of a few years. BlackBerry's current market cap is only $8bn...
* Blackberry has a strong customer base of critical infrastructure already, and their pivot from hardware to software means continuous subscription revenue.
* **If BlackBerry had the same market cap as competitor Crowdstrike -** **who it outperforms** **- it would have a stock price of $83.** That's just taking into consideration one aspect of it's business model.
* [Vanguard has doubled their position since Dec 31/2020.](https://np.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lzw0pn/vanguard_is_bullish_on_bb/)

# TL;DR: üöÄüöÄüöÄ BB is going past the moon and into Alpha Centauri. This company is so much more than a meme stock or a short term squeeze - it's a life changing opportunity. When BlackBerry starts getting IVY revenue, $20 will look like a joke and you'll have to explain to your wife's boyfriend why you didn't get in under $14 when you had the chance.

# BIG EDIT:

**I was asked about the bear case for BB. It's important to understand the risks of investing, and I'm not so in love with this stock that I'm blind, so here's the bear case:**

* A lot of investors have been underwhelmed by revenue so far, and BlackBerry missed their expectations for Q4 2020. But it's worth noting the reason for buying BlackBerry right now is that when IVY revenue starts rolling in these concerns will wash away. It's a longer term play, similar to Palantir.
* The bull case assumes CEO John Chen's estimate of being able to get roughly $500m for their patents is correct. If they get less than expected for that side of their business, or keep the patents and aren't able to monetize them in a meaningful way, that would be less than ideal.
* The Facebook settlement could end up being more like 500m than the 2bn+ that's expected.
* They could be passed in the cybersecurity field before they are able to leverage their current best in class service. This one is really unlikely considering how many other companies have tried to make products equivalent to what BlackBerry has - and failed.
* EV companies could end up making their own OS and data services to resist IVY adoption. Several are trying (Tesla always comes in this conversation as an example), but from everything I've read none have managed to make as safe and comprehensive a system as BlackBerry.

So, *if* IVY doesn't get adopted, they're no longer the leading cybersecurity company, their lawsuit is for less money than expected, and their patents are actually worthless - then BlackBerry is only a little undervalued instead of incredibly undervalued.

**Here's the most meaningful bear case right now though, and how the bulls can beat it:**

There seems to be a lot of upward resistance. Establishments, institutions, etc. are all convinced BB is a failed phone company stock worth $10. When it rises, large financial players short (because they believe they can buy back for $10 or less), buy puts, or just scalp to try and capitalize on the volatility which in turn creates a lot of resistance and breaks momentum.

I don't think there's any conspiracy, I think the big players are just incompetent. These are pretty normal pullbacks and reactions to a stock that's gaining so quickly. The problem is that those big financial players I mentioned (as well as a lot of people on WSB) don't understand *why* this stock is so desirable. They just think it's a meme stock that's being pumped and don't understand the potential of: A) Becoming an essential step of EV manufacturing; B) Being best in class security during an age of ransomware attacks. So instead of getting in and riding the momentum, they create a self fulfilling prophecy of pullbacks.

**The bulls can win the same way we've won in GME and AMC - by buying and holding. Continued days of large volume will completely fuck the bears who started taking huge short positions last week, leading to even bigger price movement. Buying shares or LEAPS and being patient is the way to play it and win big.** The bears win when bulls waste all their capital buying FDs that have no chance of finishing ITM or when they see a dip and paper hand their shares. It's funny to watch people freak out at a $2 dip when they easily could have just hedged that with a deep OTM weekly covered call. **Buy** ‚û°Ô∏è **Hold** ‚û°Ô∏è  **Yacht**

Regardless of the resistance that exists at the moment, there will come a day when big finance starts racing to get in on BB - and they'll pretend they were right all along. We've seen it constantly in tech stocks over the past few years. WSB can just expedite the inevitable by getting in on BB while it's still incredibly cheap.",DD,0.88

**EDIT (as of 4:35pm ET on 6/4/21):** We did it all, at a current afterhours price of $9.57, we hit the 5% daily gain for the day. Not too bad was it?

&#x200B;

**EDIT (as of close on 6/7/21):** We did well on Friday (5% up) and had another excellent day today (\~10% up). As a result, the daily % gain required to hit $13 by 6/14 has **decreased by 40 basis pts from 5% on Friday to 4.6% as of close today.**

AMC has approximately 4.1 million shareholders with an average of 120 shares per shareholder (if we hold the full 500 million outstanding shares) ... looks promising :)
And if I remember correctly this is without the investors from outside of US!

What do you think, time to load more?

$CLOV option volume (call volume) and delta to calculate the magnitude of the gamma squeeze.

If you've heard gamma squeeze left and right but have no clue wtf that is, [check this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nuo1kj/clov_45k_deep_otm_weekly_yolo_310000_call/h0zzli8?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

&#x200B;

Yesterday we had around 310.000 call contracts traded - by my assumptions, that's around 10M shares bought by market makers just to remain delta neutral. That's 10% of the available share float.

&#x200B;

Today, **within the 30 minutes of trading, there has been 150.000 contracts traded**. Many have certainly been sold (particularly below 15C) but above 16C it's majority new bought contracts - voluime > open interest - no one is selling naked calls surely. That's around 100.000 new contracts, at a delta of 0.6, which is around **6M new shares bought**..

The day is just starting. I'll update this within 1 hour

Meaning, 250.000 contracts traded, say 75% of contracts were bought, around 150.000 now with a delta of 0.9 and 100.000 with a delta of 0.6 = over **15 million shares bought by market makers** today.

You modafockers thought this was over? It's not. 

&#x200B;

And the tally is at: **SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND** call contracts traded! Let's assume 70% were bought, then we have 280.000 contracts ITM - representing 21.000.000 shares retired by market makers and 8.000.000 OTM purchased by market makers. That's 25% of the available float that is locked by market makers to hedge against the call contracts bought.

This is a boomer-esque company with mega potential to squeeze AND these motherfuckers GIVE you money to buy their shares ($0.10 per share per quarter). At current share prices, that‚Äôs around 4% a year, which is MORE than the average mortgage interest rate right now. 

It‚Äôs being shorted because it went public with a spac, but the company has been around since the 80s.

Also there is a short interest of 20.5% of the float. Think about this:
- shorts have to PAY to hold their position
- holders get PAID to hold their position

Gamma squeeze potential:
- 100K open interest on 6/18 $10c
- translates to the buying of 10M shares if the stock closes above $10
- That translates to a pure BUY VOLUME double the average daily volume in one afternoon

389,BNGO,np937m,2021-05-31 19:48:39,BNGO Discounted Cash Flow Model,"https://preview.redd.it/ko3tmu2buh271.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=b152ff16064d6ce20439d94e448adac57d08878f

This my quick and top of the head version of DCF model for BNGO. Please note that I haven't made any pin-point assumptions. All assumptions are ballmark to just get an high level price estimate. I'm not a financial advisor nor a financial analyst. I'm just a random guy applying his financial education in real life.

I'm more than happy to hear your feedback and update my analysis with more accurate numbers or correct any wrong assumptions. Please let me know if I'm missing any other types of revenues/expenses. If you feel its justified, feel free to share it on other social media platforms! :)

Recently on SeekingAlpha, an analyst did his DCF model and his price came out to be $7.3 which I feel wasn't justified enough. I believe it was because he didn't factor in Saphyr 2.0 potential and didn't project his sales for longer years. Well, so I took it upon myself as a small little challenge to do a DCF myself.

NOTE: This does not include the Nanonozzle revenue projection because at this point in time, its really hard to estimate those numbers. Also just wanted to note that the top analysts on Tip Rank gave BNGO an average price target of $12. I think this sort of proves my analysis that BNGO is at least worth $12.

EDIT: I have received some critical feedback on my analysis from my post on BNGO subreddit. I will be incorporating those changes, but it will only affect my analysis positively.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*\*TLDR; #BNGO2THEMOON\*\*\*\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Units Installed:

Expected sales of Saphyr to increase about 80% every year as more and more labs/clinics/hospitals/etc start to adopt it. Though from year 2028+ I have reduced the adoption to 50% every year, giving me an almost 70% CAGR.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rent/Sold:

I have broken the sales of Saphyr into ‚Äúrent‚Äù and ‚Äúsold‚Äù. This is because there are different consumables agreement with each type of ‚Äúsale‚Äù. As per CFO in Q1 earnings transcript, he said rentals are more sales; however, this might change as Saphyr is still finding its level. My assumption is 60% rent and slowly reducing down to 35% by 2030+.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Revenue per Consumable:

We currently know it costs $550/consumable. As BNGO‚Äôs goal is to reduce it to $100, I have done about $50 decrement each year starting 2024 (when Saphyr 2.0 will launch) and achieving $100 from 2028+.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Saphyr 1.0/2.0:

Saphyr 1.0 is just 5000/14 rounding it down to 350 genomes per year. Why divide by 14? Because that‚Äôs what Saphyr 2.0 will be able to do.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Min 120 Genome per 6 month (Rent Agreement):

If someone rents from Saphyr, that‚Äôs what the agreement states currently. This means minimum 240genome runs at per Saphyr (rented ones) per consumable price every year. I‚Äôm assuming they are running the minimum and not the maximum capacity i.e, about 350/year.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sold Saphyr 240 Genome Bundle:

Currently BNGO has a bundle going out for clients who buy Saphyr. For them, the genome run would cost $450 instead of $550. However, for ease of calculation, I have not included the $100 discount in my calculation. Everything is being multiplied by consumable price for the year. I‚Äôm assuming they are running the minimum and not the maximum capacity i.e, about 350/year.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Saphyr 2.0 Consumables:

This was the trickiest part in my calculations and involves a lot of ‚Äúassuming stuff.‚Äù We all know they are aiming to launch 2.0 by 2024. Therefore, adoption of 2.0 will take time and as a result it will take some time for revenue to start increasing from 2.0. We also know it will be able to do 5000 genomes a year, but not every lab/clinic/hospital/etc will be running that much. So for my calculation I have assumed only 5% of 5000 genomes runs will be done on the Saphyrs installed everywhere. This will increase by 2.5% over the years up to 20% by 2030+. In terms of CAGR, it will be increasing by almost 180% every year. Given the power of Saphyr 2.0, I think its reasonable enough estimate. I also think this is somewhat conservative and the number will be even higher. My calculations are based on that only 25% of the full power of Saphyr 2.0 will be used. This section is debatable and I‚Äôm happy to talk more about it and update it with useful feedback.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Total Revenue:

Revenue growing at 79% CAGR. Again, this is a very conservative number from my perspective. Also, as per Eric (CEO), he expects the revenue to be somewhere between 2.6B ‚Äì 3.8B with 10,000 Saphyrs sold. In my calculation, we hit 10k mark in year 2029. We can see total revenue is around 2.3B, lower than Eric‚Äôs estimation. Though my consumables estimate is between his expectation. Its just the sale of Saphyr that seems to be off. I‚Äôm assuming 65% will be sales and 35% will be rent by 2029. Maybe more of sales and less of rent might be a better estimate??

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gross Margin:

Currently BNGO‚Äôs margin is around 33%. To be very conservative, I haven‚Äôt increased margin by a lot. I‚Äôm estimating margin to steadily grow throughout the years.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additional Costs:

This is any other costs over operating expenses, just being more conservative. I‚Äôm increasing it at a rate of 20-30% over the years at a 25% CAGR.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Net Profit/(Loss):

You can see BNGO will start to be profitable by year 2024. It will really start to pick up in net profits in year 2026+.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC):

Formula: Cost of Equity + Cost of Debt

Cost of Equity = Risk Free Rate + Beta\*(Market Rate ‚Äì Risk Free Rate)

Risk Free Rate = 10Yr Treasury Bond = 1.75%

Market Rate = 8%

Beta = 2

Cost of Debt = 0 (As BNGO rarely have any debt)

WACC = 14%

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Free Cash Flow:

Assumed Net Profits as a source of free cash flow available to the company.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Terminal Value:

Assumed a 3% industry average for BNGO. Although this is very unlikely because BNGO is far away from its maturity stage. But for ease of calculation purpose, BNGO will grow at 3% for the rest of its life.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Firm Value:

After discounting all the CFs for 10 years at 14%, it gives me the company value to be around 5.5B. This is about 3x the current market cap.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Outstanding Shares:

The current outstanding shares are 279M. For the sake of dilution articles out there, lets say BNGO raises extra $350M and lets say at $7 price, this would mean extra 50M shares. So, out outstanding would now be 329M.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Price per Share:

With the 5.5B MV and 279M O/S share, this gives me a share price of $20. This is about 3x the current share price. Giving a potential upside of about 200%. Even with the extra $350M offering, the price would fall to $16.7 per share.

Well, in any case, as per my assumptions in the discounted cashflow method, BNGO seems to be heavily discounted.",DD,0.92

394,UWMC,nvjgk5,2021-06-09 03:01:01,UWMC - What inflation and interest rate mean for profits in mortgage business," Going through Reddit posts, I observe confident apes, and even more, apes looking forward for increases in interest rates. Hold on, **is that really a good thing?**

Note that this is no financial advice. It only expresses basic economics.

***Monetary policy - Inflation and reference rate***

For those without economic background, let me remind that high periods of inflation (above the 2% target) will trigger an increase in the reference rate in order to reduce money supply and bring back inflation to its accepted level (between 0%-2%). Without going into the details, increase in reference rate will transfer to commercial banks and, eventually, increase (variable) mortgage rates.

***Current situation in the US***

Looking at the time series of M2 supply, you can observe that M2 in the US is going through the roof, which has already generated a surge in inflation (4.2% in April 2021 against 0.3% in April 2020). If inflation remains at such high level, the FED will have no choice but to increase the reference rate, which will increase mortgage rates. This will affect clients with variable mortgage rate and roll-over fixed rate contracts.

Michael Burry (known for The Big Short) is betting on this and has puts on T-bills. Why? because an increase in interest rate will decrease bond prices (recall the price of a bond is the Net PV of cash flows, blablabla).

***Client's probability of default at loan origination***

Banks (or loan providers) estimate the probability of defaults (PD), where variables are for example income/affordability because they are good measures to know if the client can repay the loan. Usually, credit officers will calculate the PD with a buffer on interest rate (high interest rate means higher monthly payments which decreases the client's creditworthiness) to give some room in case of increases in interest rate. High income/affordability means good creditworthiness ofc

***Interest rate hikes, PD and demand for properties***

But what happens if inflation increases so much that reference rate is pushed very high? The risk is that the above mentioned buffer (if even existing at loan approval) will not be sufficient to absorb the hikes and clients with variable mortgage rates and roll-over loans will not be able to pay back. Contracts become junk contracts because the underlying client is defaulting.

If the general PD increases due to a major sytemic shock (e.g. significan increase in interest rate), there are two effects: a portion of clients will default and properties will be liquidated on the market, which increases the supply. Second, higher interest rate means higher rents. Hence, fewer clients will be able to afford the loans and therefore the demand for properties will decrease. More supply coupled with less demand necessarily leads to a decrease in house price index.

***Summary:***

Low increase in mortgage rates can be beneficial, yes. But if inflation keeps increasing at this speed and level, we can expect significant increases in reference rate. If increases are significant, some clients will defaults, others will not be able to access new loans, which will increase supply and decrease demand for properties, respectively. I am sure you get it, this situation is terrible for companies operating in mortgage business.",Technical Analysis,0.82

On May 11, UWM said it would repurchase up to $300 million of its shares over the next 24 months. This is a sort of dividend to shareholders.

With its $12.8 billion market cap, the $300 million represents a 2.34% buyback yield to shareholders (i.e., $300 million/$12.8 billion) over two years. This is also worth 1.17% annually, or 13.6 cents per share.

Add that to the 5.25%dividend yield (i.e., 40 cents annually divided by $7.68). So the ‚Äútotal yield‚Äù as I call it, is worth about 6.42% (i.e., 53.6 cents divided by $7.68). At $10 per share, the total yield is 5.36 % annually more appropriate valuation.

As there are about 1.605 billion shares outstanding, the adjusted EPS will be $1.16 per share. At the recent price of $7.38, this puts UMVC stock on a forward P/E of just 6.4 times forward earnings. That is very cheap.

My estimate of $1.16 is close to analysts‚Äô estimates, as seen by Seeking Alpha, of $1.14 per share. They also estimate $1.23 for next year. That puts UWMC stock on a forward P/E of just 6 times earnings.

I believe a more appropriate valuation is 8 times earnings. That puts the value at $9.84, or roughly $10 per share. This is a potential 36% gain for UWMC stock.",Discussion,0.86

Some of those stocks like $CLOV, and $DNMR had big moves up on Monday, with continued gains Tues. Others like $PLTR have much smaller gains. $DASH and $RIOT actually closed down. 

**Stocks Being Added to the Russell 3000 include:**

[To see the full list of stocks being added to the Russell 3000, search for ‚ÄúFTSE Russell 3000 index additions‚Äù \(the bot keeps flagging the link as a spam link\). ](https://preview.redd.it/m4y9h0piw2471.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e874ddc0551a492c2d10ff7985e842e5e2f161a)

**What is Reconstitution?**  
According to FTSE/ Russell, *‚Äúthe Russell US Indexes are designed to reflect the ever-changing US equity market, and the annual reconstitution process is critical to maintaining accurate representation.¬†During this highly-anticipated market event, the breakpoints between large, mid and small cap are redefined to ensure market changes that have occurred in the preceding year are captured. Companies are also revaluated to determine where they lie along the investment styles spectrum.‚Äù* ¬†

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/dfy6096gw2471.jpg?width=949&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f33bcc22926de307c2665af6f2c0ecf306714009)

**What Does It Mean?**  
It means Index Funds and Mutual Funds that hold the Russell 3000 have to buy the stock by June 25, when the reconstitution takes place. For equities like CLOV, DNMR and others with a large percentage of the float shorted, those short sellers will have added pressure to adjust or exit their positions before the reconstitution drives the price up further. That doesn‚Äôt mean every stock being added will have a short squeeze, but it could certainly influence the stock prices. With more buyers, namely index fund managers, that could lead to upward pressure on the price.   


**What Funds Hold Russell 3000?**  
A lot of index funds hold shares in the Russell 3000. Many 401K accounts allow investors to pick target year retirement dates, with a blend of different funds based on an investor‚Äôs selected dates. Many of these funds invest in different index funds. If you look at Institutional Investors making purchases of DNMR and CLOV, you‚Äôll see Index Funds are already purchasing shares, including:

 \- VRTTX Vanguard Russell 3000 Index Fund  
 \- IWV iShares Russell 3000 ETF  
 \- TMW SPDR Russell 3000 ETF  
 \- VISGX- Vanguard Small-Cap Growth Index Fund  
 \- VISVX- Vanguard Small-Cap Value Index Fund  
 \- VITNX- Vanguard Institutional Toal Stock Market Index Fund  
 \- VEXMX- Vanguard Extended Market Index Fund  
 \- VBINX- Vanguard Balanced Index Fund Investor Shares

There will undoubtedly be more announced as 13F filings are submitted.  


**The Bottom Line**  
When a stock is added to an index, it typically adds fuel to the stock price short term. With more buyers, and presumably the same number of sellers (or fewer sellers), it puts upward pressure on the price. It‚Äôs not automatic, and it‚Äôs not all at once‚Äîas you can see with DASH and RIOT. When a stock already has momentum, like CLOV and DNMR, this adds fuel to the fire in the short term. If short sellers decided to close out their positions, that adds more upward pressure. It will be very interesting to watch the stocks on the list to see what happens by June 25th.",DD,0.81

It's clearly short hunting season and it looks like we've had quite a healthy catch. Short sellers have their fingers on the panic button and are bailing out at any threat of a rabid pack of retards stomping around, pounding their chests, talking shit, and smashing their ill-gotten gains onto the backs juicy meme tickers. And, yet, the shorts do not fear the originators of such apeish behavior: Pro Wrestlers.

# How I found WWE

Let me introduce to you my patented SMELL system. The acronym is reverse engineered to make sense for this ticker and so it might seem like I was piledrived as a child, but bear with me. It's important to put memes first. Here it goes:

* **S**hort Interest is high
* **M**arket cap is high
* **E**xtremely Memeable
* **L**ow IV
* **L**ow Float

Basically, I sniffed around for stocks that would benefit the most from even a tiny amount of short covering. Probably the most important thing here is Low IV. That means the stock has to go up less for me to profit and later expirations are cheap (because I can't time wtf you guys are doing). But it also means if the ticker catches fire the IV will spike up, further resulting in massive profit.

I was quite surprised that WWE came up high on my list. As I dug into it, I was expecting that the SMELL was from sweaty redneck chads wearing spandex, surrounded by thousands of teens in Iron Maiden t-shirts who have yet to discover deodorant -- but it turns out the odor was instead the smell of bears pissing themselves.


# I: Fundamentals

I don't know anything about books of companies. You're asking the wrong guy.

However, [this guy on SA](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4416217-wwe-powerful-sports-entertainment-franchise), and many others, seem quite excited about WWE. Perhaps as children WWE superstars provided some semblance of a father figure to them. Or, perhaps, they enjoy having their homoerotic fantasies fulfilled while writing about stocks. Either way, they did all the work. So go read their stuff and you'll find WWE is solid, possibly Rock solid.

For those even lazier than myself, here are the cliff notes:

* They are effectively a monopoly on pro wrestling, which is apparently growing in popularity
* They make money from [Media, Live Events, and Consumer Products](https://imgur.com/HFAUWJl).
* COVID wasn't too bad for them. It cut Live Events, but [Media revenue popped up](https://imgur.com/IplD7p8).
* Live Events are coming back... and they're taking it international. This will significantly boost their revenues, especially since during COVID it was zero.
* Strong social media following (more YouTube subs than NBA, NFL, and GME combined). More IG followers than NFL.
* PT of $75/sh from [some fancy FCF model thing](https://imgur.com/2lqYlSE)
* Lots of aquisition suitors


# II: Catalysts

I'd be kidding myself if I thought you guys cared about catalysts, or that they even matter right now, but here are two big ones anyway.

**Live Events Resuming**

WWE will resume touring. Despite this revenue being missing in 2020, they managed to haul in nearly a billion dollars. So the second half this year, and all of next year, is going to be pretty good. Not only will revenues be driven up, but fan engagement and brand appeal will go up as well. WWE's IP has a ton of value and they've leveraged it well during COVID.. as live events come back and increase engagement, it should provide some synergy to everything else they sell -- PPV, IP rights, merchandise, etc. That's just my opinion, so please do not let the excitement of the return of live events distract you from the fact that in 1998, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table.

**Video Games are booming**

WWE Supercard is Take Two Interactive's (a $52b company) highest grossing mobile game, and it's growing at around 23% YOY. A lot of that money will flow into WWE. WWE also sells rights to other titles. As video games continue to grow, so to does WWEs revenue.

**Rumors of acquisition**

About a week ago, WWE cut some talent assets. Some apparently important guy tweeted that it's likely due to them cutting costs and preparing for an acquisition. [Here are Reddit wrestler fans discussing this (1200 comments)](https://old.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/nqovvd/former_writer_dave_schilling_ummm_i_think_wwe_is/)

Rumors aside, there is a strong case for WWE being acquired, should McMahon decide to sell. From the SA article:

> It is not unrealistic to suggest that WWE could one day be acquired. If McMahon indicated an interest to sell the business, there would be no shortage of potential suitors given the scarcity value of its content. Whilst Disney, Fox and Viacom could be prospective interested parties, arguably top of the list is Comcast, who may decide owning WWE may generate more value to its shareholders than perpetually leasing its content.

# III: Technicals

This is closer to my specialty, and it's why WWE is my new favorite squeeze play.

**High SI**: [Exchange reported SI around 8m shares](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/WWE/short-interest/) as reported May 14. Ortex shows this number has held steady even throughout this squeeze cycle. I'm imaging the shorts are trying to slowly cover to keep this under the radar, but can't help but push the stock up little by little. While the SI % Float appears to be 18%, there's more to it than that...

**Low Float**: The float on this is around 44m shares. However, the company is hedging it's convertible notes (representing about 8m shares if converted) via ISDA OTC contracts with 3 banks: [JPM](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091907/000119312516795818/d311548dex102.htm), [MS](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091907/000119312516795818/d311548dex104.htm), and [Citi](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091907/000119312516795818/d311548dex106.htm). Basically, these banks sold $38m of options, at a strike of $24.91. These are *deep ITM* options, that are pretty much fully delta hedged. **So if these banks were doing their jobs and deltahedging, that's 8m shares of commons they hold, locked up. That takes the float down to 36m shares.**

**Low Volume**: The volume of this ticker is insanely low. So, there's not a huge market of interested parties looking to buy/sell shares. That basically means as shorts cover the price will move up more. Higher days-to-cover, and higher impact of gamma ramps, which I'll get to later.

**Low IV**: To top it off, the options on this thing are cheap as well. I'm holding LEAPs and some July's in the hope that if there's any kind of squeeze, the IV will pop up substantially. That's where the real gains are in these squeeze plays... getting in before the IV pops. CLNE had a similar situation, but it's IV was originally around 80, not 40. It popped up 3%, but the options values went up 10-20x overnight primarily from the IV jump. It's insane to me IV is this low on WWE.

**Pressure on the shorts**: The stock is at levels last seen in Dec 2019, so anybody shorting it after then is red. The average age of SI, [according to Ortex](https://u.teknik.io/8Wbox.png), is 102 days. It's pretty safe to say the majority of shorts are already underwater at this point.

So, putting it all together:  SI % Float appears as 18%, but it's really closer to 22%. That's good enough for me because: the volume is low, the shorts are in the red, and it's squeezing season. Most importantly, the IV for this is priced as though it's some boomer stock.

With IVs this low, it doesn't take much for options to print bigly. The [Omega](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/omega.asp), aka elasticity, of options is huge. Omega measures how much the option value moves with respect to the underlying. For example, with July 16 $65C, If WWE goes up .1%, option value goes up 1.6% (~16x). That's because IV is so low. I'll happily take those odds.

% Float per % underlying change values of >0.30%+ get me excited, and we're only at 0.14%. However, I'm a little bitch and have high standards. 0.14% float deltahedged per 1% price move is still significant. For reference, right now, CLNE is at these numbers. Most tickers are well below that (around 0.05%).

I wouldn't say there's any significant gamma going on here, yet. The options chain is pretty scare, aside from the gazillion options held by those banks (which are considered in this chain). You can see 20% of float deltahedged -- that's primarily from those options.

What really gets me excited is the % Volume numbers. The gamma ramp is much stronger in that regard -- if you believe volume is more indicative of lower liquidity than float, then 4.00%+ are sizeable numbers. Put in English, if the stock moves up 1%, then 5.75% of the daily volume will need to be purchased as a deltahedge (assuming all options written are deltahedged). To me, that's significant, and can help multiply any upward movement.

The best part? The chain is rather scarce. Throw on a few thousand $60/$65 calls into the OI, and the ramp will extend out and become stronger.

# V: Conclusion

If you want a low-risk, high-reward play on squeeze season, this is my pick. It's got everything, and the options are dirt cheap. On today's 3% move, even my Jan leaps printed 12%. My FDs are up 30-60%.. and I think this is only the beginning.

If you want to play the company on fundamentals, but still have some exposure to a squeeze event, you cannot go wrong with Jan LEAPs. Stay ATM or just tad OTM (if you want to collect on IVs going up).

If you've made it this far, you now know what the stock is cooking: It's tendies, you retard.",DD,0.85

We own 80% of AMC and it is shorted 20% that we know of (plenty more that we don't). 43% of BB is owned by institutions and shorted 10% that we know of. I think something is up. Keep the posts and buying going for AMC fellow autists and we will all be sipping margaritas on the moon. üöÄüöÄüöÄ

Edit: Jesus Christ you smooth brained fucks, I had to turn my notifications off because my phone was burning a hole in my pocket because of the friction from vibration. Also thank you for all the awards! (Trying to message everyone a thank you). Just another note, Stocktwits has AMC messages at 164,000 messages in 24 hours vs BBs 22,000. The squeeze has not been squoze! Now I'm going to do some reverse psychology. Everytime a post blows up, the OP sometimes says ""StOp WaStInG MoNeY oN aWaRdS"" you retards then proceed to 10 fold the awards. That being said, SEND THE AWARDS! Apes can't compute instruction so this should send AMC to at least $100,000. (I tried to think of a conservative price)",Discussion,0.84

[https://www.fool.ca/2021/06/09/is-a-short-squeeze-on-the-cards-for-well-health-stock/](https://www.fool.ca/2021/06/09/is-a-short-squeeze-on-the-cards-for-well-health-stock/)

I've said it before, and I'm saying it again... 

WELL Health is lining up to be the next CLOV. 

WELL Health Technologies (WELL) (WLYYF) 

*  20%+ Short Interest
* Raised $305M priced 30% above market led by the 29th richest man in the world. 
*  JP Morgan and RBC extended credit lines to over $500M combined
* Aggressive M&A activity that caused no dilution which now puts them as the largest clinic provider in Canada and expands footprint into the US through CRH Medical. 
* Nearly $500M in revenue with $100M in EBITDA 
* Fenwick & West Engaged for a NASDAQ IPO in Q4 of this year - Fenwick did literally every big name from FB and AMZN to COIN and is extremely exclusive. Likely that they selected WELL. 

By no means am I saying CLOV is a bad company I really like them both but WELL just seems like a situation where the market hasn't caught up to the fundamentals and I think it's just a matter of time now. 

I mean look at this... A year of consolidation while the company has exponentially increased the business offering. Time for the chart to do the same üöÄüöÄüöÄ

&#x200B;

* Volume bars on 4/16 and 4/19 are totally insane. Has to be institutional accumulation, a great sign.

&#x200B;

* Anchored VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) pinch from high and low of 2021 ‚Äî watch for some bouncing around in this area and a break to the upside (hopefully).

&#x200B;

* Price now above curling upward 50-65 SMA cloud **and** curling upward 20-23 EMA cloud.

&#x200B;

* Resting on volume shelf below ‚Äî if it dips, watch for a bounce (hopefully) off the $8.50 - $8.75 area, buyers seems to be interested in that level.

&#x200B;

* Breakout levels to watch marked on chart with the thick dotted line: $9.25 and $10.56. These are levels I drew myself and are definitely **not** 100% accurate.

&#x200B;

* Above $10.56 looking at a resistance volume shelfs between $12 - $13, then a smaller shelf between $14 - $14.30. Above that looking at relatively smooth sailing to break through all time highs of $17.45.

&#x200B;

* Maybe all these levels get blown away by a squeeze? I don't know.

&#x200B;

* Remember that I'm dumb. Do your own thing.

441,A,npzfzx,2021-06-01 19:28:09,A reminder that CEOs are not WSB'ers,"On April 15, 2021 the CEO of AMC pledged:

"" We are going to pledge right now today publicly and we will file this publicly so it will be binding on us, because you can‚Äôt announce intentions and then not carry through it, **we hereby pledge at AMC that if the shareholders approve this authorization for 500 million new shares to be issued we will not use one of those 500 million shares in calendar year 2021. Not one. Not one**. ""

Today, only 45 days, (45 days later!):

"" AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC) (‚ÄúAMC‚Äù or ‚Äúthe Company‚Äù), announced today that it has entered into an agreement to raise $230.5 million of cash from the sale of equity to Mudrick Capital Management, L.P. in exchange for 8.5 million shares of AMC‚Äôs Class A Common stock. ""

&#x200B;

Now, certainly, in a technical sense, AMC could argue that these new shares that were issued were actually authorized in 2013, but that is just in a way a bit of legal wrangling. The fact is that when the CEO was boasting about not selling new shares, they were likely at the exact same time in talks with Mudrick Capital to sell shares (230M deals don't just happen overnight).

&#x200B;

Now, it may be good for AMC to get some cash, but we shouldn't overlook the duplicity here. Mudrick is a hedge fund, and if you think for a second they are going to have diamond hands, I would look yourself in a mirror. As soon as the squeeze is pushing shorts, Mudrick will be right there to help them close all their positions.

Edit: As several users have pointed out, it appears Mudrick has already sold their entire stake. This is BAD for a squeeze, as it means all the shares are trading on the market.

Sup, WSB folks!

It‚Äôs Roman here with my Technical ANALysis, remember me? I‚Äôm the guy who [put the beard on the line, stating that GME is heading at least to thousands](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/), soon, and my beard is doing well so far, as you may see. Furthermore, recently I did [AMC TA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc_looking_juicy_next_resistance_targets_1623/), and it got to [CBS fucking news](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/)! Btw, the first major resistance there of $16 has been broken already, $20 is the next one and the things are going according to the forecast.

Congrats to AMC hodlers, but today we‚Äôll take a look at the superior stonk‚Äòs current TA state, discussing how things might play out in the shorter term perspective.

The first thing to take a look at this [GME](https://imgur.com/a/eAxaHhE) chart, is the beautiful Bollinger Bands setup. Bollinger Bands is a powerful TA instrument, used by traders for the purpose of identifying potential support and resistance zones, as well as a trend direction. Furthermore, BB is a helpful tool to work with the volatility, as price action‚Äòs fluctuations are taken as a cornerstone measurement for the Bollinger channels. As you should be able to see on the chart, with the volatility in Jan, Feb and Mar the BB channel looks thick (just as your BF‚Äôs GF‚Äôs ass). Since the beginning of April, though, the consolidation is obvious, and the channel consequently has been narrowing down. But BOOM, the breakout happened yesterday followed by the conformational solidly looking gap today. The setup of a very similar nature crystallized in January too (highlighted blue) and it is easy to see what happened afterwards. Juicy, what else can I say.

MACD. The thing points up, indicating the bullish momentum, with all of the threes indicators (MACD, Signal and Histogram) being on the bullish territory and accelerating with the current price action.

And the most important factor to üêª in mind, resistances. As I mentioned in the title, the Purple Haze ($233) is being tested currently, and to my understanding, this is the most important price level for GME currently (refer to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/) for the explanation). As soon as this one is conquered, $350 and $481 seem to be the next two major resistances on the horizon.

I hope, that you enjoyed this little piece of TA, have a great day!

While at home I had nothing to do, so my cousin introduced me to way of making money while recovering and you guessed it was the magic of stock options. After a few weeks of making a couple thousand bucks, I decided to put my  whole $10k worth of savings into options. So I basically went from 10k -> 28k -> 50k -> 7 bucks in a span of probably 6 months. After hitting basically rock bottom I realized now that had to actually work to get money. So I got a job working at an Amazon Facility. After 6 months of a slow and arduous climb I got back to my original starting point of 10k plus some. So the going to 7 bucks made me a bit more careful about my money, but just last week I put $100 bucks into AMC options and it gained more than %1000, so I was like fuck it YOLO ALL-IN AMC, I've been here before I can do it again, although I did think that with a little bit of melancholy.  Also I'm sorry I did sell back my initial investment of 17k, and it's with a little bit of spite but I had to think of my student loans, the hospital bills, and other stuff I have to pay for. But honestly I might use the money to execute some these calls if after paying for all that shit, I still have some left.

In fact, meme stocks may be immune to this gayness because they have nothing to do with market fundamentals or real economic data, which is what I think is going to drive a selloff.

**When?**

Starting tomorrow and lasting as short as 2 weeks or as long as a few months, with a hot CPI number as the catalyst. For those of you who don‚Äôt know and are literally trading stocks without paying attention to anything going on in the economy, the CPI (Consumer Price Index) number is the main gauge of inflation.

**How big?**

10% or more, depending on the magnitude of the CPI beat.

**Why?**

A feedback loop driven by algorithms that trade based on bond market data.

**Why should I give a shit about the bond market?**

I don‚Äôt trade bonds, and think bonds are for fucking nerds and boomers, but if you‚Äôve been in the market since the beginning of the year you know that the bonds, specifically 10 year treasuries, are arguably the most important market drivers in the world. The bond market is about twice as big as the stock market and the price action of bonds dictates the movement of the stock market to a large degree. A big swing in the bond market has the potential to completely fuck the dynamics of the stock market and the CPI. When bonds get bought, the 10 year yield goes down and when they get sold, the yield goes up. The 10 year yield also goes up in response to inflation and dictates the mortgage rate one can get at a given time, the interest rate at which businesses can borrow money, etc. It is therefore a very important indicator for earnings predictions and general economics. Algorithms (which account for about 80% of stock market volume( either directly look at the 10 year yield to make trades or derive earnings estimates and other money flow from the 10 year yield.

**What have 10 year treasuries been doing lately?**

At the beginning of the year there was a correction based on a rising 10 year yield that was particularly bad for growth and tech stocks that do well in a low interest rate environment. The 10 year yield has been very low over the past year because when the market crashed, the fed enacted historically dovish monetary policy to bolster stocks and the overall economy. One of the policies the fed enacted was purchasing of bonds by the US treasury in order to keep the 10 year yield stable.  In recent months there has been talk of a ‚Äútaper tantrum‚Äù  wherein the fed begins to phase out those stabilizing purchases as the economy recovers. Powell has been adamant that he will keep treasury purchase in place for the time being and that he will give us plenty of warning before he begins to taper bond purchases.

Last week, the fed announced that it was going to stop buying corporate bonds and ETFs, which was another dovish policy similar to treasury purchases that they were doing in the corporate bond market. The fed wasn‚Äôt doing a huge amount of corporate bond buying so that wasn‚Äôt a huge deal for the economy or market, but caused some to get nervous that the fed may be getting ready to ease 10 year note purchases in the months ahead. However, this fear was short-lived because last week, employment data came in that showed lower-than-expected job growth.

Generally, job growth is a very important inflation indicator. So important that until a few months ago when the fed changed its mandate, it was the main factor determining whether the fed would raise or lower interest rates. A cool employment number caused the bond market (also largely algorithm-driven) to buy a lot of 10 year bonds because weaker job growth is supposed to mean weaker-than-expected inflation. Therefore, over the past week, the 10 year yield has made a big move (about 8%) down and caused the broader indexes to rally. The S&P, Dow Jones, Russell 2000, and Nasdaq are all at or near record highs based largely on the fact that bond yields have been going down and algorithms have been triggered to buy. Right now the 10 year is hovering around 1.5%, which is the lowest rate it has been since March. Since the initial rise at the beginning of the year, the 10 year has typically bounced off of the 1.5% level and has gotten as high as 1.77%. Despite the rise of the 10 year, it is still well below its pre-crash levels of 2% or more.

&#x200B;

**What is going to happen to the 10 year yield going forward and how is that going to trigger an algorithm-fueled, gay bear feedback loop?**

Above I talked about how the 10 year yield fell on the cool jobs number. The glitch in the market matrix started last week when the ADP private payroll number came out. The report said 978,000 new jobs were created in May, a high number that was relatively in-line with most estimates. However, the ADP report has, for some reason, not been accurate over the past year or so. When the real employment number published by the government came out the following day, showing a mere 559,000 jobs being created, a corrective rally in 10 year treasury notes started and has persisted into today, driving the 10 year yield to multi-month lows.

*To summarize what has happened so far: ADP gave an employment number that diverged from the government employment number, the government employment number missed estimates, bond traders and algorithms derived a low inflation number from those low employment numbers and overcompensated bond purchases, bond yield went down, stonks went up.*

This overcompensation could affect the bond and stock market tomorrow and in the weeks ahead. There are a few potential catalysts that could drive a big move in the 10 year and the downstream stock market over the next week. The first one is a 10 year note auction today at 1 pm. While I don‚Äôt expect the auction to cause a major change in treasuries, there is a possibility that some selling could occur this afternoon to cause fluctuation in the 10 year since the price is at a multi-month high. Tomorrow and next week are huge catalysts though, because the CPI number is being released. While bond traders and algorithms attempt to derive a rough inflation number from employment data, the CPI number is the ‚Äúreal number‚Äù that indicates the level of inflation the economy is experiencing and what price people are paying in the typical transaction. On Wednesday next week, the Fed meeting and Powell‚Äôs subsequent comments will dictate how the Fed will respond to the inflation number and whether it will raise interest rates (it won‚Äôt) or begin tapering bond purchases (it might).

*The bear thesis is contingent on tomorrow‚Äôs CPI number being a huge beat.* That was the case last month and a big reason for the May selloff. While the expected number was 0.4% MoM, the actual number was double that (0.9%). Given that 10 year bonds are very overbought with an 8% rally this week, a hot CPI number like the one we saw in May could raise the 10 year yield as much as 10 basis points. If it goes up 5 or more basis points, a correction is highly likely and will have a magnitude proportional to the strength of the 10 year yield move. This is not guaranteed. This month‚Äôs CPI number is projected to be 0.3%, but based on various factors like continued housing market strength, increased oil prices (especially over the past month and with a big miss on crude inventories data this morning), and general price increases (see Chipotle news), I tend to think 0.3% is a very low estimate. Moreover, employment data may have been a red herring for bond traders and algos because of the continued unemployment assistance being given by the government. While a weak jobs number would normally produce a similarly weak CPI number, unemployment assistance has the ability to elevate prices without job growth. That is the main issue with the data being used by algos right now. While the bond market won‚Äôt necessarily react violently to a hot CPI number, the recent rally has it primed for a selloff and resultant spike in yields.

**Other Red Flags**

A few other things happening in the global economy and in volatility are making me nervous.

*A big one is China.* Yesterday, China released its own CPI along with its PPI (producer price index, or cost to manufacture goods). The Chinese economy showed a divergence between CPI and PPI, which is irregular. While Chinese producers showed the biggest overhead cost increase in decades, they seem to have decided to eat the cost and elected not to pass the price increase on to consumers. This makes sense if you agree with Powell‚Äôs standpoint on inflation being ‚Äútransitory‚Äù (temporary). Eating production cost increases isn‚Äôt a big deal if it‚Äôs only for a few months and while it might cause company profits to dip, it won‚Äôt have a far-reaching economic impact unless it is sustained and producers are forced to pass the price increase to consumers. While I agree that huge inflation reads like I expect tomorrow are transitory, I still think overall inflation has picked up in a relatively permanent way. The current labor shortage along with job creation via stimulus and potential infrastructure spending will force companies to offer new employees higher salaries and increase salaries permanently across the board.  Also, something tells me US companies are less likely to eat increased production costs than Chinese companies which rely on low costs to gain an advantage over foreign rivals. There is also the possibility of the government instructing its companies to hold off on price increases while the recovery is taking place.

*Also, volatility is at an inflection point*. I follow volatility pretty closely, understand it, and have [written about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmt5s0/fyi_for_people_new_to_the_vix_and_vix_etfs_before/) in the past if you want to understand it better.  Currently, the VIX (which measures options premiums of S&P 500 stocks) is near post-crash lows. It got as low as 16.57 yesterday, which is about 7% off the low (not a lot for the VIX), and has generally bounced off of that range during swings over the past year. Today it‚Äôs up to 17.21. For comparison, it got up to near 22.00 during the May correction and was in the high 30s during January when meme‚Äôs almost destroyed the stock market. While a VIX rally doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean there will be a correction, high option premiums imply that institutions are hedging big swings. VVIX, the derivative of the VIX which measures the rate at which options premiums are changing and generally goes up prior to big moves, is way up today (9%). VXN, the new volatility measurement of the Nasdaq, is also near post-crash lows. While volatility is still elevated compared to 2019, the next couple of weeks will determine whether volatility decreases to pre-crash levels (10.00-20.00) or continues to stay in the range it has been in (20.00 to 40.00). Continued volatility decrease would be a good sign for the market, but I‚Äôm not sure we‚Äôre ready yet given the uncertainty of the situation.

**Powell**

If there is a correction, the length of time it will last is based largely on the Powell testimony. A hot CPI number might cause bond markets to freak out, but the fed‚Äôs stance will largely dictate whether a spike in the 10 year is confirmed and continues into the 2% range or if it stays steady. The CPI number will play a little bit into the speed at which the fed tapers asset purchases but they already know what they‚Äôre going to say next week for the most part. Another part of my bearishness has to do with my opinion that Powell will announce tapering between now and the end of the year next week, which could cause a correction regardless of tomorrow‚Äôs inflation data.

&#x200B;

**Oh yeah, RSI**

Edit: I forgot to add in the part about the indexes being overbought. They aren't horribly overbought like at levels we saw in September, but they're at levels they've bounced off of a few times in the past. This means there is plenty to sell if there is a bearish catalyst. In recent months, SPY has been able to do okay maintaining rallies in overbought conditions, while QQQ has performed pretty poorly when RSI gets above 70. RSI spikes (in either direction) on the yearly chart have been decent forward indicators of corrections since 2020.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**How to play**

Don‚Äôt buy VXX, UVXY, or any other leveraged index fund or volatility tracker. Those suck, have low upside, and don‚Äôt necessarily go up and down the market (see link above for explanation of VIX futures funds). Just play puts in the indexes (or calls if you disagree with me). I tend to think that monthly QQQ and IWM options are good targets because they have more beta than SPY. But the Nasdaq has already had a big correction while SPY has been largely unaffected and is closer to (may close today at) record highs.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TLDR: Bond market could shit its pants and cause a correction if the market underestimated the inflation data coming out tomorrow. Happy Pride Month.

Edit: Thank you for the pee martini, kind stranger!

Edit (6/10): CPI was higher than expected but not as bad as I thought it would be. Market correction may be delayed until Powell testimony but could still start today or tomorrow. If futures go down >1% that's a bad sign for indexes. Look for a 7+ basis point daily gain on the 10 year yield. Look for a fast dip in RSI. All of these are indicators that it's imminent. 

Powell will likely have to announce the taper next week and it will likely be gradually until the end of the year. Markets will probably bounce next month when the CPI report reveals that inflation is normalizing. However, oil prices have been spiking in June so if they continue to rise then CPI might not give a normalish print until August. If indexes see a >10% correction, give up YTD gains, and panic ensues, it will be the best buying opportunity of the year. Good luck retards.

Edit (6/10): I remain bearish and extremely gay. A 1.1% gain on the Nasdaq and huge bond rally after a second consecutive CPI beat reaffirm my belief that this is algo-driven and outrageous.

Edit (6/16): WEDNESDAY WEDNESDAY WEDNESDAY! FOMC CAGEMATCH. 

If Powell is too dovish then bonds could sell off and lead to a correction. Is he's too hawkish then bonds could sell off and lead to a correction. If he perfectly walks the tightrope then we could go higher still. Then again, bonds could also sell off and lead to a correction.

Edit (6/16): I was right and the worst thing that could have come out of the Fed meeting did, in fact, happen. The Fed did not announce a taper and increased inflation expectations. The 10 year bond yield is currently spiking upward and will likely exceed previous yearly highs in the next few weeks. Algorithm-driven selloff is commencing on bonds and the major indexes. Until the treasury selloff slows down this will not likely stop. Also, remember that quadruple witch will occur on Friday so volume will be extremely high.",DD,0.87

Bear F#ck train is ready to leave the station.","YO if you haven't looked at this stock yet, its time to open your eyes. CRSR investors have been watching this roll out for the last 6 months while getting strangle-boned by some big bears.

I wrote a pretty detailed DD on Corsair yesterday and the institutional investor shenanigans that have been going on with it [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nrldny/crsr\_about\_to\_break\_through\_its\_3\_month\_sideways/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nrldny/crsr_about_to_break_through_its_3_month_sideways/)

TL;DR, Corsair is probably one of the most undervalued and manipulated high growth stocks on the market right now. Yea yea many apes say this about a stock...but this one is clear as day with even a cursory look at the history, fundamentals and trading patterns.  It's being held down by short sellers and swing traders profiting off of the extremely low float/low volume.

It has incredible fundamentals in an exploding industry, with rapid growth, increasing profitability, and a massive earnings beat. Nearly the entire tech sector market has outperformed CRSR on technicals, and the price has continued to trade sideways for months, Why?

The only bear case is a bunch of boomers saying computer usage will magically disappear after the pandemic lifts (of course ignoring the fact that 2/3 of the workforce is going partial or full time remote)

It's because they can tank the price with intraday shorts since the volume is so low. And they have been writing millions in call options at $35 and $40 through EOY.

Here's the pattern they're using.... Run stock up to \~$35, increasing options premiums. Write tons of $35C, collect premiums, sell tons of shares (either short or actual), price tanks to $31. They re-purchase / cover shorts at $31... drive options premiums back up... rinse and repeat.

Today, we're seeing something pretty wild happening.

# After Hours Shenanigans

Big money investors have been playing this stock like a puppet. Last night is a prime example. After a week-long run... some big pocket investors managed to instantly tank the price 6% after-hours on very little volume.

https://preview.redd.it/axa93ypdla371.png?width=577&format=png&auto=webp&s=da1039fceba3f44a4dca6b22704629910f45a7b3

These sorts of shenanigans have been par for the course with this stock. After the insta-tank...someone unloaded hundreds of thousands of shares at market open this AM to keep the price down.

Throughout the day, despite big relative trading volume, the price has traded sideways. Why?

What it looks like is aside from big intraday short activity, the big boys are desperate to keep the price under $35. Why? Because they have tens of millions of $ in  $35C and $40C stacked up through the end of year

https://preview.redd.it/pv34llb7ja371.png?width=992&format=png&auto=webp&s=aaf299139407598b777482ab67345abefa0da002

Market forces are TRYING to push this stock up, while whales are doing everything they can to puppet it down.

# Buy Pressure Stalemate

As it stands, buy pressure is nearly double sell side. Drilling down into Level 2, we've seen big buy walls supporting above the $31.5 break even and holding strong.

https://preview.redd.it/6j2k90zhja371.png?width=1883&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1978500195ad12a1e1c8db99914bd23cee8a0b2

The price is sitting on a solid floor in a stalemate.  This stock is literally trading on sale, primed and waiting for some retail momentum to take off.

# The Play

Buying shares and long calls. If this thing takes off and holds past $35 strike by 6/18, its going to moon BIG.

This stock makes huge swings on very little volume. With even a modest uptick in buy volume, its going to make a run. More shares need to change into retail hands.

All of the fundamentals are there. There is absolutley no reason for the current trading pattern other than scratch-deep market manipulation.

UWMC is the nations #1 wholesale mortgage lender based out of Michigan. They have a variety of advantages over their competitors in the mortgage field. 
I understand a lot of people are trying to move the sub away from chasing short squeezes, however it is worth nothing that this stock is sitting at 20.5% short interest and the borrow rate is quite high https://iborrowdesk.com/report/uwmc . I have already seen a few posts directed at this stock and it‚Äôs potential.

From \~ 33% on Monday to over 98% as of Today 05/14/2021 with very few shares even left to short.

The float pool is nearly depleted and that has led to a considerable run, in addition to a 300M stock buyback announced starting May 11th.

Ishbia is squeezing the shorts with a buyback just like RKT did with that special dividend.Jump on board!

Im up 15% on shares and 35% on 6/18 options from the sale Tuesday this week (post-earnings DUMP was a perfect buy in but we have plenty of room left to run).

As long as we remain above resistances/target are **13.14, 13.71, 14.41, 15.45, 17.50** \- the first one being the most important - but be careful of all of them

Below, support is **10.83, 9.86, 9.14**

\-----

Seeing this one discussed more and more - and it's actually one of my favorites to trade - so I figured I'd drop a roadmap.

[$CLOV 1Y 1D](https://preview.redd.it/8bmwfuniqw371.png?width=2225&format=png&auto=webp&s=99f61cc11734a7821f5b1feeed9015ffa75fd6d6)

Not the prettiest pattern - but it's damn near all we have to work with here. Yeah you could draw a trendline from 1/27 - 4/29, but it doesn't do you any good in this situation. 

Perfect confluence with that **11.86 level -** this is the main one I've been keeping my eye on. The daily close above today was really important. This makes it a great level to play off of and manage risk with (you can put your stop loss somewhere under depending on your risk tolerance/sizing).

Below that main support level is **10.83, 9.86, 9.14.**

Basically - as long as we are above - we are in breakout mode targeting **13.14** mainly. With momentum - beyond that is **13.71, 14.41, 15.45, 17.50 -** but that first target is my **conservative** estimate. There **should** be some resistance there.

Also note really nice volume today - which is always a plus.

Yeah we might be overextended by traditional metrics - but I don't really look at those sorts of things - and in memes especially they are pretty useless. Just keep in mind any play on a stock this volatile is going to come with **increased risk** \- but I know you folks don't mind.

Small caps broke out big today and it's looking better and better for a lot of these names. Pretty awesome we managed to hold into a third week of this madness.

I need you all to focus for just a few minutes please. I've been a member of this sub long before any of you bought your first FD. I'm not against new tards or trying to gatekeep anyone. But anyone in this cesspool, especially the newer members, need to know what they're up against.

Day after day the front page and daily are being spammed with shill accounts or bots and people are blindly following it. Or maybe the mods are asleep at the wheel or bots can move posts faster than genuine posts. Idc what your positions are, what you stand for, just get those bags.

These are just some of the tickers I see being shoved down your throat all over this sub from people/accounts that are suspicious to say the least. As many of you may know, Citadel who has major undisclosed and still open short positions against GME and AMC is long on these companies that are being spewed here in WSB. So if you have any interest in either of these heavily manipulated stocks and maybe don't want to to the bidding of these abusive short hedge funds, consider what they are trying to manipulate in this sub.

Also, please note, these are just the disclosed positions. Short positions are not disclosed on 13F's and they do not directly equate to those short positions. Married options do exist and they are often used to ""adjust"" a hedge funds overall position/leverage so they don't get a call from marge; but this still gives us some insight even if its not the whole picture.

This is only a glimpse of what this sub has been infiltrated with. I can assure you this also extends through ""digital assets"" to balance leverage to appear long for several garbage coins. Especially since Robinhood pushes that shit and they are owned by Citadel.

I'll leave you with another post that I found extremely informative that I believe gives some additional insight as to how tickers are being manipulated with HFT algos to offset the books and balance leverage as to appear like they're not about to go tits up if any of these memes explode.

Don't believe or buy everything you see on this sub. That should be a given but hoping this post sheds some light as to why you'll see shit on the front page or 9/10 comments in the daily mentioning the same ticker all from accounts with the ""frequent commenter"" (because they're constantly spamming) and created somewhere between January 20-Feb 10th.",DD,0.89

W-shape with today's price action.

* For the w-shape to hold true we need to push over 418.

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418.
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

491,DD,nax536,2021-05-12 21:28:12,$UWMC Ultimate DD - still hot,"This DD is NOT my own, but was removed for troublesome language. I read through the DD and understand why the OP had their post pulled down. That being said, the content is solid and I think its worth repeating. I have edited the below DD to remove the parts that were maybe a little too over-eager.

$UWMC ULTIMATE DD

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC. The massive 5.75% dividend. Their insanely LOW P/E of about 3.9 and their insane income growth. 4,200% increase in net income! üöÄ (No that‚Äôs not a typo)

So why would any one want to buy this stock right now ?

The CEO is a beast. And not only did they reaffirm their dividend (ex date in June) and just make $860M in the first quarter, they announced the approval of a $300M stock buy back. That‚Äôs big money ! But let‚Äôs dive deeper. The $300M share buy back is of the class A shares that are in the float. $UWMC has a very small float.

104M shares. $300M / $6.70 = 45M. That means at current prices they can buy back nearly 44% of the entire F\*\*kin float. You have never heard of that before and you probably never will again. On earnings call yesterday CEO says ‚ÄúWe can start buying shares tomorrow and I am a buyer at this price !‚Äù

So that leaves 60M shares left in the float. Institutions own 23M of them (I bet it‚Äôs higher) short interest is close to 13M based on latest data.

This just caused the borrow rate to increase by 5X ! new data shows short borrow rates just hit 25%

Apes, there are less than 35M shares freely traded in this stock right now.

On top of all this we still have Russell Inclusion to be announced in June and another blow out 2Q is in the works.

This is NOT financial advice but I can't think of a reason I shouldn‚Äôt park a few dollars in a highly profitable stock, trading at all time lows, paying a 6% dividend with a current p/e under 4?

My position 7900 shares @ 7.64 and 45x 6/18 8c

TL,DR üèò=üíµüíµüíµüíµ = UWMC üöÄüöÄüöÄü§ë  


Edit: since I posted there are only 2,000 shares to loan and the borrow rate is 35%!!?!??

497,A,nuhgua,2021-06-07 18:57:21,$CLOV= BET TORWARDS A BETTER AMERICA AND A BETTER SYSTEM,For years the health care industry has been ruining middle age and older Americans. For example they charge insane premiums that should be criminal. CLOV is a tech based company that truly gets Americans the cheapest Medicare that they can possibly receive. And for some odd reason these large institutions don‚Äôt see this company as solid. CLOV has been beaten to the ground and these institutions who are shorting this company don‚Äôt want them to succeed. They are trying to revolutionize the way we look upon healthcare. We have a 40% short interest and this isn‚Äôt even including the possible naked shorts that made AMC A TRUE PHENOMENON. They are growing at an insane rate and these large corporate suits do not enjoy them coming for there breadwinning healthcare center while simultaneously crushing poor to middle income Americans. I take it as this-if you purchase CLOV your taking a bet on america and the prosperous outcomes for a better healthcare system/provider. Shorting CLOV is unamerican and the suits that are doing such should be penalized by transferring there wealth into our pockets!
