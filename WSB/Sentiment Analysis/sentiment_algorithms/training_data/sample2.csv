16,A,nityz2,2021-05-23 00:39:52,UWMC ex DIV 6/9??? A Match Made in Heaven,"UWMC has gone up 25% in a week and its still undervalued and over shorted based purely on my autistic beliefs.

EX dividend is literally 6/9 do you need to know anything else? This was made for WSB.

EDIT: I guess I have to do some real DD so automod doesn't ban me. Nobody reads that shit anyways.

Reasons this fucker is going to the moon:

1. They are the top mortgage lender... If you listened to their earnings call it was much different than RKT's. While RKT saw margins damper and guided down for the future, UWMC actually had a completely different tone. Margins were practically unaffected and they probably couldn't have given better guidance. TLDR: Rates go up we dominate competition and market share. Rates stay at these levels we continue to have massive revenues and return that money to the shareholders.
2. Next reason, they actually return money to shareholders! First year on the market and they already pay a dividend and have a massive share repurchase program in the works.
3. Now onto that share buyback program. They announced $300m of share repurchases.... for context when they announced that the entire float was worth $600m... you can see how this might affect price.
4. This company is making nearly 900m a quarter of NET INCOME and is priced at $12b... Show me where else you can find this in this market.
5. As you've already heard a million times by others Wall St is shorting the shit out of this thing for no apparent reason and you best believe they are doubling down after that run up and the recent fed comments on decreased house sales.

TLDR. UWMC going to the moon.... Way over shorted way under priced worst case scenario you are holding something that pays you every quarter and has a track record that lasts decades.

POSITIONS: ROLLED 7.50 calls to 6/18. have about 5 8/20 $6 calls and a shit ton of shares that are paying me every quarter

EDIT: Retards dividends aren't just important for that 10 cents. Stocks like to pump into ex dividend as boomers get interested and pay 50 cents more for a 10 cent dividend. Also I've heard talks of some guy named Russel being interested in the stock, does anyone know if he has a reddit?",Discussion,0.85
17,AMC,ntp2xh,2021-06-06 18:07:01,No AMC or BB holders should be wearing pants and here's the analysis to prove it,"Like all of you, I was fascinated by Adam Aron's bold strategy to not wear pants in a [Zoom interview](https://www.crossingbroad.com/2021/06/adam-aron-did-not-appear-to-be-wearing-pants-on-this-zoom-call.html) last week. However, I was even more fascinated by the correlation between Aron's refusal to wear pants and the price of AMC. As you can see in my red crayon analysis below, Thursday saw a deep AMC dive, but quickly rebounded after Aron's daring refusal to wear pants during his interview. As a result of Aron's fearless leadership, tendies soared, and it rained diamonds. Of course, paper handed bitches  immediately started denying that Aron was pantsless, causing fear and doubt among the lesser apes, and AMC dropped on Friday.

But all this no pants business got me thinking. What about ***MY*** pants? If Aron's no pants correlation is true for AMC, is it also true for BB? Luckily, I hadn't yet eaten all of my red crayons, allowing me to do another deep dive into BB, which is also posted below. As any true smooth brainer can see, there is an obvious correlation between whether I had pants on and the price of BB. I was WFH on Tuesday and Wednesday, so obviously I refused to wear pants, and BB soared as a result. However, my batshit crazy boss made me come in for a half day on Thursday, and I had to wear pants for some of that day, resulting in pants confusion and a volatile BB market. Friday was terrible, as I had to return to the office for the ENTIRE day, resulting in horrible losses for BB.

The conclusion of my analysis is clear guys. DO NOT WEAR PANTS next week. If your boss won't let you WFH, then quit and go work for your wife's boyfriend.

TL/DR: **DO NOT WEAR PANTS THIS WEEK YOU RETARDS**

Ericsson to pay $97 Million to Nokia for after settling damages claim

Reuters

Telecoms gear maker Ericsson [(ERICb.ST)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/ERICb.ST) has reached an agreement with Finland's Nokia to pay a damages claim of 80 million euros ($97 million), it said on Wednesday.

Ericsson said the settlement followed investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) into corruption, including the bribing of government officials. It settled with the DoJ in 2019 and agreed to pay over $1 billion in penalties.

The DoJ had [said](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-ericsson-idUSKBN1YA2HU) that Ericsson admitted to conspiring with others to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act from at least 2000 to 2016 by engaging in a scheme to pay bribes and to falsify books and records and by failing to implement reasonable internal accounting controls.

Ericsson said on Wednesday the settlement would impact operating profit (EBIT) by 80 million euros and cashflow by 26 million euros in the second quarter.

""The amount reflects uncertainty, risk, expense, and potential distraction from business focus associated with a potentially lengthy and complex litigation,"" it said in a statement.

The Swedish company added that the remainder of the settlement amount would be made in similar instalments in 2022 and 2023, impacting cash flow.

""Nokia can confirm that the information in Ericsson's press release is accurate. We have no further comment,"" a spokeswoman said.

Ericsson did not immediately respond to requests for further comment.",Discussion,0.91

As seen by a recent post here that has been gaining traction, $CLF is a ticking time bomb of fundamentals and shorts getting fucked.

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvscvi/clf_crushing_shorts_with_steel_beams

The post above highlights some of the points on why the stock is an amazing play.

The link below shows the latest short interest report with 21% SI

""The 6 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for Cleveland-Cliffs Inc have a median target of 24.50, with a high estimate of 33.00 and a low estimate of 20.00. The median estimate represents a +20.93% increase from the last price of 20.26.""

This is already a no-brain play. The price of the stock has been suppressed for weeks by shorts and it is a ticking time bomb. B

https://youtu.be/kcagi2icXaU

Even the CEO has said these analysts should kill themselves.

The price of steel is at an all time high which means that the profit margins of companies lik CLF, who are vertically integrated with mining, processing, and producing are higher than ever. 

Let's take a look at the options chains

EXPIRING THIS WEEK:

8,000 OPEN INTEREST ITM CALLS EXPIRING
24,000 OPEN INTERESTED OTM CALLS EXPIRING WITHIN 10% price difference.

EXPIRING NEXT WEEK:

30K ITM
30K OTM WITHIN 10%

With a 10.123B market cap @ 20.27 a share we are looking at 500M shares.

WITH THE CALLS EXPIRING WE ARE LOOKING AT 6,000,000 SHARES ALONE WHICH EQUALS MORE THAN 10% OF THE FLOAT.

With a realistic price target set 20% higher than current price, and a massive surge in options being exercised within 10%, I'm expecting a share price of AT LEAST $30 short term. I'm surprised this stock hasn't had more publicity in forums personally so I thought I'd add onto the post I saw earlier.

Disclaimer: this is not financial advice.

I‚Äôm big on studying trends and I believe I have found a 2-3 bagger for you retards. I‚Äôve been following $RIDE for about 2 months now, and I noticed the potential for a short squeeze beginning to form last week. I‚Äôve noticed the propensity to squeeze comes from the following criteria:

* Short % of float must be over 20% ([over 28% of $RIDE‚Äôs float is short](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ride); probably closer to 30-32% since it was last updated)
* Small/Mid Cap stocks with considerable growth prospects ($RIDE has a $1.6B market cap) in a hyper-growth EV industry
* Heavily controversial stock, meaning some say it is way overvalued, some say it is undervalued

These stocks tend to be the most volatile. The charts are often comical to even look at (feel free to check out $RIDE‚Äôs 6-month chart for reference).

**$MVIS comparison:**

Taking a look at $MVIS, I noticed that Hindenburg research targeted them in a short & distort attack a few months ago.

I actually googled ‚ÄúHindenburg MVIS‚Äù and the second article that popped up was titled ‚ÄúTechnically Incompetent Short Seller Hindenburg Makes False Statements About MicroVision.‚Äù This bodes very poorly for Hindenburg, as they seem to have started to formulate a lot of their claims out of thin air.

More recently, Hindenburg targeted $RIDE with the same tactics. They called out $RIDE‚Äôs pre-orders for their trucks, while almost all EV companies are utilizing pre-orders, this[ has been clear ever since $RIDE went public](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/16/2127140/0/en/Lordstown-Motors-Releases-Business-Updates-Remains-on-Track-to-Begin-Production-of-the-Lordstown-Endurance-in-September-2021.html) last year.

I found a good[ rebuttal post for Hindenburg‚Äôs attack on $RIDE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkt7qi/the_bullcase_for_lordstown_motors_corporation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on this sub from not too long ago as well.

**$RIDE Intro:**

Lordstown Motors ($RIDE) is currently developing their [full-size all electric Endurance truck](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/endurance). They have an[ experienced management team](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/corporate-governance/management) with multiple execs from companies like Tesla, Volkswagen, GM, Honda, etc; also, GM‚Äôs investment in exchange for their [massive 6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/) helped them hit the ground running. They are targeting commercial fleets and government contracts with their truck initially. Their trucks will be $45,000 after tax credits and get a 75mpg equivalent. They also will require very little maintenance as they utilize true 4 wheel drive with hub motors in each wheel.

Discussing their[ full-year 2020 results](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020) on March 17th, $RIDE management confirmed that ‚ÄúTimeline to Start of Production (SoP) in September 2021 remains on track, with beta prototype build underway and the first beta vehicles to be ready by the end of March; vehicles to be sent for durability, crash, validation, and lighting testing with various partners and to early initial customers for feedback.‚Äù

They have[ shown their betas to the public](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1377350607518920705?s=20) as well.

**Ohio‚Äôs Endorsement of LMC:** üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ

[U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), a Democrat who represents the Youngstown, OH area and is running for the senate currently, didn‚Äôt mince words about the (Hindenburg) short-seller report. He called it ‚Äú‚Äòbull\*\*\*\*. I mean it was just to me, it seemed like a hatchet job for (short-sellers) to make money,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd look, I mean (Lordstown) is threatening the status quo. And a lot of people are going to bet against them, figuratively and literally. It comes with the territory. You don‚Äôt get to the top of the mountain without a bunch of people trying to drag you down.‚Äù

[Secretary of State Frank LaRose](https://www.vindy.com/news/local-news/2021/03/ceo-extols-positives-of-lordstown-motors-on-heels-of-critical-report/): ‚ÄúI think what this is, is an opportunity to take a challenging circumstance from just a few years ago and turn it into a truly unique and amazing opportunity for not right here in the Youngstown area ‚Äî Voltage Valley as we like to call it ‚Äî but all over Ohio.‚Äù

[Ohio Governor Mike Dewine:](https://www.cleveland.com/open/2020/06/gov-mike-dewine-said-he-expects-success-from-lordstown-plant-in-first-normal-press-conference-during-pandemic.html) ‚ÄúReally, this is the future,‚Äù DeWine said of the truck and the facility, where he got a private tour. ‚ÄúI think this truck has a great competitive advantage over its competitors.‚Äù

[Senator Michael Rulli](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), the Republican state senator from the area, has introduced several bills in Ohio aimed at helping the electric-vehicle industry, said he‚Äôs visited the (Lordstown) plant recently. He said he‚Äôs seen the company‚Äôs robotic assembly line putting together a series of 57 betas. Based on what he‚Äôs seen, Rulli said he thinks Lordstown Motors will be producing thousands of Endurance trucks sometime this year or perhaps early next year. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre way way way far along,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhoever wrote that article (Hindenburg) has never been in that (Lordstown) plant. That is a fact. Anyone who was in that plant would read that article and think it was garbage.‚Äù

**I WILL NOW SCREAM IT FOR ALL OF YOU: ALL OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TO $RIDE‚ÄôS**[ **MASSIVE 6.2 MILLION SQUARE FOOT FACILITY**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/lordstown-motors-races-to-revive-shuttered-ohio-gm-plant.html)**. $RIDE IS LEGIT AND WILL BE PRODUCING ELECTRIC PICK-UP TRUCKS FOR COMMERCIAL FLEET CUSTOMERS IN JUST 4 MONTHS.**

They also [recently announced ‚ÄúLordstown Week‚Äù](https://businessjournaldaily.com/lordstown-motors-stock-climbs-14-on-lordstown-week-announcement/) in mid June for analysts, customers, partners, and investors to attend. This will silence all of the short-sellers, lawsuits, and FUD.

$RIDE has an earnings call tomorrow 5/24 where they will be giving updates on crash testing. If they announce they are still on track for mass production in September, this will be HUGE.

**$RIDE Upcoming Catalysts include:**

* [Earnings call tomorrow 5/24](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-announces-timing-first-quarter-2021-financial) to discuss updates on crash testing and timeline to production.
* [Department of energy Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (ATVM) loan](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759546/000110465921037690/tm2110022d1_ex99-1.htm), which should be announced by the end of Q2 2021 (literally any day now).
* [Release of ERV in conjunction with Camping World](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2021/01/lordstown-motors-to-reveal-electric-commercial-van-this-summer/), which is expected next month, and the[ Camping World CEO has already leaked a sneak peak](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1379433681995984905?s=20) of it.
* Beta production updates and contracts with commercial fleets.

**Summary:**

$MVIS moved from $10 to $27 in just a couple of days, and I believe $RIDE is about to make a similar move from $10 back to $20+ with their earnings call being tomorrow after-hours.

EVs are front and center, and the government is pushing for the adoption of EVs in such a big way that you‚Äôd be a fool not to own a piece of the pie.

$RIDE has one of the lowest market caps out of all of the EV plays, and they are the closest to fully automated mass production (this September).

Position: 5 Jan 2023 calls w/ a $40 strike. I‚Äôm planning to buy more tomorrow before earnings.

**TL;DR:**

$RIDE stock has incredibly high upside, and I think it‚Äôs only a matter of time until it squeezes back up to the $20‚Äôs. I have been following the chart for a while now, and I believe institutions are currently loading up before this gets squeezed back up.

Here is an explanation for the movement from yesterday.

&#x200B;

Starting out with the first 15 min of the day, we hit our first target of 22.05 which was a big resistance level according to the volume profile. 

After fighting to continue upward, TLRY responds with heading down to 19.10 to fill the gap from premarket. 

&#x200B;

This movement from TLRY then caused somewhat of a panic to its holders due to a three-point drop, which ended with forming a flag until after hours. 

This is the best set up we could have gotten for continuation.

&#x200B;

Relative Volume was up 3.60.. 84 mil volume yesterday, 25 mil volume on average.

We have filled the gap with volume coming in. The ideal play for today is to shoot past the 22 resistance level and head for the next target at 24.42

&#x200B;

Hold strong and have patience!

With publicity from WSB and a boom in volume, there is big potential for WKHS to spike to the 20's and higher.    
A bull flag can be identified on the 30 min chart with the end of Friday leaving us sitting on an important level of support.. which is comforting. Monday premarket will be the deciding factor for if we continue higher or potentially drop back into the wedge. We have a gap fill around the 28.00 area, but this is out of the question until we get over 21.03 (Second Target).    


Here are the levels I am looking at:   
Entry - 13.48   
1st Target - 15.68   
2nd Target - 21.03   
Stop Loss - 12.33    


Wait for a bounce off POC and breakout from 30 min bull flag @ 13.48 for entry. This is a simple play, no need to make it complicated!

Analysts still don't believe $PLTR can achieve their 4B'25 revenue goal. They're projecting rev of 3.37B by 2025 end. My models shows 4B'25 revenue is discounted to $20 current price with 12% discount rate.

While management continue to believe the 30% CAGR is just the BARE MINIMUM growth rate.  
(1.1B'21 \* 1.3\^5 = 4B'25). As a result, 4B'25 goal is just a conservative estimate by Palantir management.

Turtle Beach is trading at 11.29x and near ATH. Logitech trades at 24.03x and is at ATH. Now this is difficult for CRSR because they just IPO‚Äôd less than a year ago. P/E ratio will likely step more in line with next earnings.

45,CLOV,nw04kf,2021-06-09 18:35:01,$CLOV showing a similar pattern as $AMC and $CLOV prediction for this week,"Pattern:

I've been patient with AMC in the last of couple days with over $100k invested @$19. I'm starting see a familiar pattern with CLOV. I see a similar pattern with AMC's second day of rise and CLOV's behavior today. With an initial spike, both of these stocks all started with a high pre-market price and a cooldown throughout the day. Eventually, AMC showed this pattern for a day or two until it shot up for the last time before the short squeeze began. CLOV is still at an infant phase of a massive potential squeeze. The shorts are putting on pressure to keep CLOV low, but the counter pressure from retail investors are holding the stock and not give into the panic. Holding the line for a day or two will accumulate more retail investors, who are buying these dips. If CLOV is the next short squeeze play, it will surpass AMC in a heartbeat.

Prediction:

CLOV is a gamble play for sure. There is always a probability of short squeeze happening depending on many factors, like media and sentiment. However, CLOV was my next pick because the numbers showed me that it definitely had a massive squeeze potential, and I saw a familiar resemblance with AMC. High risk high reward.

If CLOV plays out like how AMC did, CLOV will close today with the resistance around $17\~$18 range. The next morning, CLOV will see a massive spike during the pre-market and cooling off for a bit throughout the day. Then CLOV would've stabilized around $20 and the shorts will start to get impatient. They will have to cover their shorts because they are not seeing CLOV going down anywhere close to $7\~8 again in the next couple of days. Thus, the short squeeze will begin. Once it begins, more retail investors will join in. With the options expiring on the 18th, more people will join in seeing a potential gamma squeeze. I can see this stock go to an unimaginable numbers if the pattern continues. 

This is a domino effect play. The first step has to be completed before moving onto the next. I believe that the first step is already completed, and we are at the second step, fighting against bearish sentiment. Third step is the squeeze. Fourth step is wait for the squeeze to stabilize, and the last step is to cash out the profit.

This is purely my personal opinions and not a financial advice. Seeing how big the wallstreetbets community is, a pattern like this is likely to happen again. At the end of the day, retail investors don't change their behaviors over night because we are not under any management or any strategy. The pattern will repeat.",Discussion,0.72
46,RKT,nsanas,2021-06-04 19:30:59,RKT is nearly in the s&amp;p 500. Did some research and this is SUPER bullish.,"Read Edit 3 below. Cant change the title but because RKT has Class D and A shares they can‚Äôt be included as of 2017 implementations. However still useful info. It‚Äôs still not impossible either, rules can change and restructuring can happen. 

I do about 20 hours of research on the stock a week. I went straight to the filings and found the following information that makes RKT insanely Bullish play and investors wet dream. Not financial advice. 

The best part about this DD is that the news wasn‚Äôt shared to retail and kept quiet so you know it‚Äôs legitimate stuff. 

One of the requirements of being inducted into the SP 500 is having 10% of the company shares available to the free float. Right now it‚Äôs 7% and just recently grew at the end of May. Which I just found out.

https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/additional-material/sp-500-brochure.pdf


Here is the filing.. just happened. 

https://doc.morningstar.com/Document/045ec7d96db807790e6ffacc2db8cf35.msdoc/original?clientid=globaldocuments&amp;key=52dbc583e1012395

RKT was also just ranked 194 in the fortune 500 recently, and also ranked 5th in the best places to work by the Fortune 500. The company also makes billions of dollars a quarter and netted $2 billion in q1. 

One of the reasons why RKT is trading at its current price is because the float availability is so small. There is no other reason than that because you can‚Äôt be ranked the 194th richest company in America and have a market cap of less than $40 billion when the average company on the SP 500 is trading at an average PE ratio of 30 to 40. ARKT is sitting at four. Obviously it can be undervalued but it doesn‚Äôt make sense to anybody unless you read this post or do any research whatsoever. Not only that but they are continuing to grow and aggressively successful in doing so. 

Here‚Äôs the funny part and makes a ton of sense. If you look at the filing, Dan Gilbert sold his shares at $16.83 a share. Wonder why he would do that? Well if you read the filing you‚Äôll see that he is transferring his shares to class D shares which is used for employees and typically employees get a discount on a stock plan. Being that it‚Äôs one of the best places to work according to fortune 500 it‚Äôs reasonable to assume that they have a great benefits plan. Now the shares are sitting as class D shares waiting to be distributed either as gifts, awards, or acquired by employees through their stock purchase plan on a discount of current market price. He literally sold shares way below valuation to provide employees with amazing benefits. 

Funny part is now the stock is sitting around $20 a share. If the employee gets...I don‚Äôt know, a dollar discount. They now get it at 19. Selling at 16.83 gives Gilbert wiggle room when his employees purchase shares. This means it‚Äôs very unlikely the stock will ever fall below $18 again due to the fact that Gilbert will now possibly be taking a loss on the shares that he sold. He won‚Äôt have any shares below 16.83 available in his class D. So if an employee wants to purchase the stock at a discount and the stock sitting sitting at $17 there are no shares available to buy at 16‚Ä¶ Get my drift.?  Maybe this is another reason why he sold shares at 25 because he knew he needed to transfer shares lower and wanted his employees to accumulate at a very awesome price because the man is selfless.

Now... as far as the market goes investors know exactly that this is happening, trust me they have been around the block. They also now see how much a philanthropist the owner actually is and that they actually achieve the results that they speak of. You‚Äôre not one of the richest people in the world and don‚Äôt know how to work the market especially when you own a multi billion dollar mortgage company which frequently involved the market. 

This is amazing in so many ways because investors are not going to let retail buy below 18 for a very long time or ever and if they do you better load the F up. Once he transfers  remaining 3% needed to be in the S&amp;P 500 the stock will soar even higher, but I think there‚Äôs going to be investors pushing up the price at a premium prior to this happening. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll take any longer. I‚Äôm hoping that some stupid hedge fund associate read this post and tells his boss to gig is up so that it just happens already but maybe that‚Äôs wishful thinking.

Honestly if it gets inducted into the S&amp;P 500 and they actually achieve the results they want to achieve as they verbally stated in multiple earnings calls, 1k-2k a share is actually possible for a company ATH.
They have shown that they continue to grow and innovate at any cost.

My PT is $80 by November 2021. Pos 15k in  January 2023 calls. Looking to retire on this one. If you want something shorter there is a cup and handle for me on the daily chart with the gap to fill about 15% up from here. 

TLDR: RKT will eventually be inducted into spy as the owner continues to transfer class a shares to class D shares for employee plans. They were sold at 16.83 and I am assuming the reason is because the employees get the stock at a discounted price. This is just a theory but holy shit it makes a ton of fucking sense and I cannot wait to be a millionaire.

Edit: Also , I believe the buyback will only be initiated if it goes below 17 again. Then he probably will transfer shares at a higher price in which his employees will have no problem obtaining again at a discount.

Edit 2: please don‚Äôt talk about UWMC, you‚Äôre literally here because RKT put you on the board. Seriously, I don‚Äôt care how much Adderall I take I won‚Äôt waste anymore brain power on researching that stock. I know you‚Äôre going to anyway because I can‚Äôt get away from you cockroaches, but try not to if you can. Comparing the two is actually disrespectful. Come back to this post once they make it to the Fortune 500.

Edit 3: I was just informed on dual class structure which doesn‚Äôt allow for RKT into SPY. Unless there is a way around it. Companies like Google were grandfathered in. Fuck me eh. Regardless, a larger float and a the reason for the transfer of shares is still bullish. I would change the title if I could. Still useful info and also unlikely to see it below 17 for an extended period of time due to the fact the Dan sold shares at a 15% discount",DD,0.81

Black berry‚Äôs forward revenue will be dominated by two things. Cylance, their cyber security software, and IVY and QNX, their vehicle data hub. Let‚Äôs start with IVY and QNX

QNX is a software for vehicles to compartmentalize all their software and data. It‚Äôs essentially an operating system for smart cars. It is currently in 175 million vehicles, with more being added every day. Any company without proprietary software (almost all of them besides Tesla) rely on QNX to run their cars‚Äô software 

IVY is a software that reads and organizes vehicle sensor data being picked up by QNX. This is a software in the process of being rolled out, that will create the early stages of a third party self driving solution for any car company without a proprietary self driving software (almost all of them besides Tesla.) With neural networks, which are what are used to make cars self drive, data is king, and you need a lot of it. It will not be an easy thing for car companies to build themselves. And when it comes time to compete with Tesla‚Äôs self driving cars, they‚Äôll all be clamoring for IVY

Cylance - Blackberry Cylance is an AI driven anti virus software. It‚Äôs confusing, but the gist is that there are many variations of the same virus, most being one time use and have never been seen before, and AI anti virus is needed to detect and stop all the variations. Cylance has been able to stop the attack used by dark side, the hack that brought down the colonial pipeline, since 2015

Deep Fucking Value - black berry is currently trading with a market cap of 4.8 billion dollars. It‚Äôs cash on hand is $739 million. Bringing the market cap to $4 billion. It also has 38,000 patents, some of which are in the process of being sold to Facebook for potentially 1-2 billion dollars. On the low end of these patent sales, this puts the market cap at $3 billion.

That‚Äôs $3 billion dollars for a key cog in the self driving pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) a key cog in the smart car pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) and a key player in the cyber security industry (a $250 billion dollar industry)

# Products & Customers

* BlackBerry isn't just a phone company any more. They provide best in class cybersecurity.
* BlackBerry's most notable product is QNX, an RTOS with several applications. [Read here for more.](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le53ol/comprehensive_guide_about_bb_and_how_it_shall/)
* In December of last year, Amazon announced a multi-year global agreement with BlackBerry QNX and developed IVY, a cloud-connected smart vehicle data platform. IVY allows automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data and create actionable insights from that date. It's possibilities are endless, and I highly recommend reading more on Amazon's initial announcement.
* OK, so what the fuck does the point above mean? It means that **right now, electric vehicles are a gold rush, and BlackBerry is the one selling picks and shovels.** Through Amazon, IVY is going to become an integral part of the EV process.
* The market is sucking the dick of EV manufacturers, but EV production is low margin and low scale. **BlackBerry IVY is data monetization, which is high margin and has unlimited scale.** Within a few years, BlackBerry will be making much more than the auto manufacturers they're partnered with.
* Blackberry QNX is used by 23 of the world's top 25 electric vehicle OEMs.
* BlackBerry targets more than just EVs though. They also have or are developing products for healthcare, financial services, government markets, energy, gas, oil, and smart grid connected transportation.

# Cybersecurity Leader

* BB offers best-in-class security, safety, and reliability. 18 of the G20 governments are customers, and they are the only software company to attain various security certifications from the US Govt.
* Ransomware attacks have begun to impact American businesses like never before. Today, the commerce secretary stated ransomware attacks are here to stay, and that businesses should plan accordingly.
* You know that oil pipeline that was taken out by DarkSide ransomware and caused oil shortages across the southeast U.S? That wouldn't have happened if Colonial Pipeline were using BlackBerry. Something tells me companies won't be making that mistake in the future.
* According to Frost & Sullivan Research, BlackBerry addresses 96% of cyber threats, and 77% of Fortune 100 financial companies use BlackBerry software.

[Here's a list of BB Certifications obtained in 2020.](https://preview.redd.it/qey899yxnp371.png?width=1259&format=png&auto=webp&s=f51e571ce7afcaf17126b2c168cb3f7a37343c35)

# Some Basics and Fundamentals

* BlackBerry has an \~$8bn market cap with $1bn+ in yearly revenue and $800m in cash.
* Since 2016, the number of QNX products has grown from 50 million to 175 million.
* BB owns \~38,000 patents worth approximately $450 million.
* BB recently won a lawsuit against Facebook. I am unable to find the details, but most estimates are for between $1bn - $5bn total, paid over the course of a few years. BlackBerry's current market cap is only $8bn...
* Blackberry has a strong customer base of critical infrastructure already, and their pivot from hardware to software means continuous subscription revenue.
* **If BlackBerry had the same market cap as competitor Crowdstrike -** **who it outperforms** **- it would have a stock price of $83.** That's just taking into consideration one aspect of it's business model.
* [Vanguard has doubled their position since Dec 31/2020.](https://np.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lzw0pn/vanguard_is_bullish_on_bb/)

# TL;DR: üöÄüöÄüöÄ BB is going past the moon and into Alpha Centauri. This company is so much more than a meme stock or a short term squeeze - it's a life changing opportunity. When BlackBerry starts getting IVY revenue, $20 will look like a joke and you'll have to explain to your wife's boyfriend why you didn't get in under $14 when you had the chance.

# BIG EDIT:

**I was asked about the bear case for BB. It's important to understand the risks of investing, and I'm not so in love with this stock that I'm blind, so here's the bear case:**

* A lot of investors have been underwhelmed by revenue so far, and BlackBerry missed their expectations for Q4 2020. But it's worth noting the reason for buying BlackBerry right now is that when IVY revenue starts rolling in these concerns will wash away. It's a longer term play, similar to Palantir.
* The bull case assumes CEO John Chen's estimate of being able to get roughly $500m for their patents is correct. If they get less than expected for that side of their business, or keep the patents and aren't able to monetize them in a meaningful way, that would be less than ideal.
* The Facebook settlement could end up being more like 500m than the 2bn+ that's expected.
* They could be passed in the cybersecurity field before they are able to leverage their current best in class service. This one is really unlikely considering how many other companies have tried to make products equivalent to what BlackBerry has - and failed.
* EV companies could end up making their own OS and data services to resist IVY adoption. Several are trying (Tesla always comes in this conversation as an example), but from everything I've read none have managed to make as safe and comprehensive a system as BlackBerry.

So, *if* IVY doesn't get adopted, they're no longer the leading cybersecurity company, their lawsuit is for less money than expected, and their patents are actually worthless - then BlackBerry is only a little undervalued instead of incredibly undervalued.

**Here's the most meaningful bear case right now though, and how the bulls can beat it:**

There seems to be a lot of upward resistance. Establishments, institutions, etc. are all convinced BB is a failed phone company stock worth $10. When it rises, large financial players short (because they believe they can buy back for $10 or less), buy puts, or just scalp to try and capitalize on the volatility which in turn creates a lot of resistance and breaks momentum.

I don't think there's any conspiracy, I think the big players are just incompetent. These are pretty normal pullbacks and reactions to a stock that's gaining so quickly. The problem is that those big financial players I mentioned (as well as a lot of people on WSB) don't understand *why* this stock is so desirable. They just think it's a meme stock that's being pumped and don't understand the potential of: A) Becoming an essential step of EV manufacturing; B) Being best in class security during an age of ransomware attacks. So instead of getting in and riding the momentum, they create a self fulfilling prophecy of pullbacks.

**The bulls can win the same way we've won in GME and AMC - by buying and holding. Continued days of large volume will completely fuck the bears who started taking huge short positions last week, leading to even bigger price movement. Buying shares or LEAPS and being patient is the way to play it and win big.** The bears win when bulls waste all their capital buying FDs that have no chance of finishing ITM or when they see a dip and paper hand their shares. It's funny to watch people freak out at a $2 dip when they easily could have just hedged that with a deep OTM weekly covered call. **Buy** ‚û°Ô∏è **Hold** ‚û°Ô∏è  **Yacht**

Regardless of the resistance that exists at the moment, there will come a day when big finance starts racing to get in on BB - and they'll pretend they were right all along. We've seen it constantly in tech stocks over the past few years. WSB can just expedite the inevitable by getting in on BB while it's still incredibly cheap.",DD,0.88

I am so confident in it, that I dared to put my beard (which I have for five years already) on the line! Worth your full read, I promise! I decided to structure the analysis in the following way: first we'll take a look at the VW short squeeze, revisiting its origins and background as the very first step of the discussion - in order to better understand the fundamental context of TA; after that I'll lay down the main technical parameters and frameworks, through which the [GMESS](https://imgur.com/a/Sd4uE1b) thesis will be dissected, applying all of those to VWSS and explaining the TA core on the Volkswagen example; then, the process will be repeated, but this time TSLASS anatomy will be elaborated upon. Finally, all of the data accumulated in the process, as well as the major findings made, will be applied to the current technical state of GME, in order to construct at least a potential forecast and the probable price action. Buckle up and eat a crayon, let's start.

Oh, and one more thing! I really encourage you to dive deep into the ANALysis with me, because the thesis can only be understood if all of the technical factors at play are considered in the sharpest detail first - and then in the aggregate: zooming out and looking at the bigger picture through the prism of coincidences, interdependences and probabilities. Dafaq did I just write? - Dunno, but that's exactly what I meant!

# Volkswagen - Das Short-Squeeze: Sep 2007 - Mar 2009

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Remember, when VW became the most valued company in the world for a brief wild period of trading? I bet, Pepperidge apes remember. The squeeze played out right in the midst of the global financial crisis, and such an occurrence was fueled by a curious background scenario, orchestrated largely by one very interesting person. Back then, the former President of Porsche, Wendelin Wiedeking (must be a cousin of Battlefield Counterstrike), was pursuing a goal of taking over Volkswagen. In this process, he used cash-settled options to circumvent the transparency and disclosure of Porsche‚Äôs market operations. While being acquired by Porsche, Volkswagen had its ordinary shares premium risen to disproportionately high levels compared to its preference shares.

As the general public was finding out about Wendysking‚Äôs takeover plan, hedge funds and particularly short-sellers set their eyes on the fact that Volkswagen‚Äôs preferred shares were traded at a significant discount to the ordinaries (approximately 70%). While the price of the ordinary stock gradually increased, the preferential shares stayed put - and the hedge funds smelt an arbitrage opportunity. They started shorting the stock and buying the preferred shares to profit on the massive divergence. For a moment, there was no news of Porsche continuing its purchase of VW ordinaries from the market, and that fact gave the hedge funds additional confidence. Only to get blindsided, as it turned out later. One shorts-frying weekend, Porsche announced its total holding in VW, cornering the substantial part of the float, and leaving only 6% in free float. In the meantime, short sales had risen to 12% of total stock outstanding. When the market found out that Porsche had acquired 74.1% of the outstanding shares through the in-transparent cash-settled options, VWSS happened - briefly making Volkswagen the largest company in the world, and finally allowing the shorting side to [GUH](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpnzup/i_recorded_todays_marketopen_and_the_instant/):

&#x200B;

>It was mathematically impossible for every short-seller to buy a share, and therefore close their position. In other words, half the room were going to be left in a burning building with no way out. A panicked dash for the exit began.

&#x200B;

‚Äî A spot on metaphor by Jamie Powell, an FT journalist. Hedge funds are estimated to have lost $20 to $30 billion by betting against VW ordinary stock.

What is really ironic (in Palpatine voice) - even though Porsche managed to burn many short sellers, the company couldn‚Äôt pay up for the huge positions it had created, and ended up being acquired by VW instead.

Also, interestingly enough, after his departure from Porsche, Wiedeking was charged with market manipulation for his role in the takeover bid. The charges were dropped in July 2016 due to a too little chance of success. Lucking Fegend.

&#x200B;

**Now let‚Äôs take a look at how this epic event was incorporated into the chart:**

[VWSS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/d3pfzvb202z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e497ddf6518faec188269120c44df64ab6cb1791)

Even though it all looks overwhelming from the first glance, don't worry, I'll explain. There are only two major TA instruments used here, namely Fibonacci retracement üåàtool (useful for assessing 'altitude' and the crucial support/resistance levels, check out the in-depth explanation of this TA tool [in my other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mwevzz/the_big_short_20_why_bears_may_soon_reconsider/)). The second one is the trend based Fibonacci extension for time periods (pink vertical grid with numbers 0, 0.382, 0.618 and so on) - for setting the major time landmarks and zones. Furthermore, you should have noticed the three catchy geometric figures, and the purple line - which is actually a good starting point to unfold the technical thesis.

In the process of working with VW, TSLA and GME charts, I managed to identify several peculiar characteristics and patterns, that were of an evident nature and have been manifested on all of the three charts, to one degree or another. The most prominent one, in my opinion, is the killer purple resistance/support level. For the current VW example, it is somewhere around $30 mark, or $29.27 if you like precision.

One may observe on the chart above, that this level is indeed the most significant level through the complete history of VWSS. First, the preliminary to the squeeze major bull run, which solidly accelerated in the middle of September 2007, was held back and repulsed by this level's resistance on the last day of October. It took almost half a year for the price action to catch up to it again in late March 2008. This was followed by a consolidation (with several failed attempts of breakout) just below this level, which lasted for more than 100 days, before the price action finally torn the resistance apart with the powerful gap on the 16th of July '08. And guess what? Even after that, the level played the major supportive role for the price action, with one final retest before the squeeze finally lift off it in the middle of September 2008. You should also make a note of how the price was still magnetized by this level during the final stages of the squeeze. The signifficance of this price level for the whole chart of VW above is difficult to underestimate. Seeing the importance of this level and being a fan of Jimi Hendrix, I decided to name it ""**Purple Haze**"".

Let's inspect the fancy geometric shapes now. These are actually much more reasoned and circumspective than it may seem from the first glance. The first one, in orange, is a cup shaped consolidation (let it be called the ""**Squeezy Grail**"", because why not?) - taking place above 100% Fibo and just below the 'Purple Haze'  - which commenced as soon as this major resistance level had been tested for the first time. It is subsequently followed by the second consolidation of a flatter nature \[if you know what else is of a flatter nature, comment and if the joke is good enough I may give you an award\], which again plays around the main $30 level on the chart. The second consolidation, highlighted by the pink rectangle (a.k.a. the ""**Runway**""), is actually more important than the first one, because here is the point where the paramount breakout happens: the 'Purple Haze' resistance is blew off (in the middle of 0.382 period). Based on that observation, it is also appropriate to assume that in order for the squeeze to initiate, the 'Purple Haze' has to be conquered at some point inside 0.382 Fibo time zone, during the 'Runway' stage. Finally, the triangular ""**Squieezluminati Confirmed**"" part is self explanatory, imho. Oh, just one commentary worth being made here: take a look at how the squeeze itself is proportionate, bipartite, and fits well into the isosceles triangle. The nature surely knows how to play with stonks, too.

Especially, when we talk about Fibonacci. The horizontal üåà grid, Fibo retracement, is often used to estimate the possible corrective trend's depth, as well as to identify the key support and resistance levels of it. This one is comfortably applied to the beninging and the apex point of the trend (see the gray dash and dash line on the chart above), and its relevance is subsequently confirmed by how the price action plays around the levels in the triangle. The 12th of September '07 seems to be a good starting point for Fibo retracement application, because on that day another important resistance of $20.72 was penetrated for the first time (then confirmed as support with the beautiful bear trap candle on 23 Jan '08). Furthermore, $20.72 level works like an ideal 100% Fibo retrace level for the current example, and supports the 'Holy Grail' comparable to how my granny supports me. Also, take a note of the 'Purple Haze' being relatively in the middle, in between 78.6% and 100% of Fibo retracement - an important factor that will enable us to apply this retracement to GME later.

Not only the 12th of September fits well as Fibo retracement starting point, it is also a perfect spot to start stretching out the trend-based Fib time grid (TBFTG - to be fucked then go, alternatively). This one is a complex instrument, so take this quick explanation for granted or do your own research in relation to it. Just like Fibo retracement, TBFTG is based on Fibonacci sequence, but this one applies to time periods, instead of the price action and levels. In order to use this instrument properly, it is necessary to identify the preliminary major trend, that will serve as the core measurement for the sequent time periods. Oh, it took me a lot of time to inspect that parameter and to identify those initial pink dash and dash trends, trust me! Tbh, it was one of the most difficult tasks to accomplish in the preparation of this TA. But the result was worth the effort! I noticed the following correlation applicable to both VWSS and TSLASS (and hypothetically to GME too): TBFTG pink dash measurement must involve the major preliminary impulse of the prior main trend, plus 'Squeezy Grail' phase. The staring point of TBFTG is particularly tricky to be identified, and I'm talking about all of the examples, but possible - especially when looking at the TA as a whole, referring to how the grid applies to the price action, and comparing the examples between each other. That is pure rocket science, if you ask me. And most importantly, the TBFTG measurement duration (pink dash and dash trend) seem to be very similar in length to 'Squieezluminati' basis - check the bars measurements on all of the charts (blue lines for VW).

Pay attention to the following features, which really help to dissect the squeezes' anatomies and to build the suitable technical framework: *the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone; and the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, peaking at 1*; *TBFTG pink dash measurement includes major preliminary trend plus 'Squeezy Grail', as it has been mentioned above. Furthermore, the correlation in duration of TBFTG measurement and the triangle basis must once again be emphasized.*

Noice, but let's move further.

# Tesla, or how Elon Mask truly ‚Äúis become meme, Destroyer of shorts‚Äù: Apr 2019 - Apr 2020

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Tesla and the founder Elon Musk have confronted the short sellers on a regular basis, and even after the run-ins with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for now, the former have been winning. The TSLA shorters were sitting on mark-to-market losses of over $40 billion in late 2020, as the company‚Äôs shares exploded 740% last year. This information is based on data collected by Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, a fin-anal company.

Remember the not so distant in past Tesla 'mania'? The prospects of Tesla‚Äôs business and the furious opposition of bulls and bears, including famous fund managers like David Einhorn and Mark Spiegel (who still hold a strong opinion that TSLA is a house of cards ready to collapse), have over the years contributed to an extreme volatility in the stock price. Elon Musk openly criticized the short-sellers and their motivation to dig out and spread negative sentiment about the company. The 'taking Tesla private' play seemed to work out for the short-sellers as the stock price collapsed by about 50% from November 2018 to May 2019. After that, amidst Tesla‚Äôs opening of the Shanghai Gigafactory and the announcement of the company's first annual operating profit exceeding analyst expectations, the tables have turned and the bear-beaten TSLA shares skyrocketed in price (not without noble WSBetters help, definitely). Needless to say, that previously steady short-sellers started getting anxious and scrambled to cover their positions.

&#x200B;

Dusaniwsky told Institutional Investor (B2B media) that shorting Tesla is:

>The longest unprofitable short I‚Äôve ever seen!

&#x200B;

Well, Mr. Dusaniwsky, WSB seem to have an answer for everything:

https://preview.redd.it/h3l5hayu02z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecc69df97a282c4a22663e8487cf316488ed9d32

&#x200B;

While companies and founders often hold a scorn on short sellers, because they can bring down stock prices and cause the cost of capital to rise (or even do worse things, if you know what I mean), Musk‚Äôs disdain for the short selling community is unrivaled. In the middle of 2020, Musk took a dig at short sellers by releasing 'short shorts'. These now sell at a premium on Ebay. It's all nice and good, but I have another cool merch idea - '**shortz r fuk**':

&#x200B;

Beautiful, isn't it? Let's quickly run through the short squeeze anatomy checklist, thoroughly elaborated in the previous TA chapter via the example of VW. First things first, the 'Squeezy Grail' is present, but it resembles more of a V shape structure. Next, the 'Runway' stage is good-looking: a fucking massive gap happened there, and this time 78.6% Fibo level is tested during the 'Runway', being indicative of the TSLA bulls' crazy power. 'Squieezluminati Confirmed' is also really interesting here, as this time there is no isosceles triangle at its core structure, but rather a 'chainsaw'-like volatile price action taking place. Furthermore, you may see that inside of the triangle, there is the after-peak 78.6% Fibo zone retest, which in turn hedl and bounced the price back in the direction of... Moon. Blessed be the bulls!

Looking at the 'Purple Haze' (which is again in between Fibo 78.6% and 100% \[important!\]), for TSLASS the major price level manifested at $52.46. During the first half of 2019, this level played a role of a magnetizing support, with the subsequent testing in March and the breakout to the downside in late April. Again, a lengthy, half a year long consolidation is taking place just below this level, and above Fibo 100% retracement. The breakout occurs, you guessed, right in the TBFTG 0.382 zone. And what is really fascinating, is the fact that, after the breakout, the 'Purple Haze' has never been retested. But who knows what the future holds?

And the Fibos. The retracement, again, apples perfectly onto the complete squeeze structure: 78.6% is trialed several times; all of the upper levels except for 38.2% were broken with the subsequent retrace and and some with the retest. A particularly intensive price action was occurring for about two weeks near the 23.6% Fibo level, and the high of $189.4 level was penetrated and then touched gently during the initial squeeze. Ah, almost forgot, 100% ($35.75) Fibo level firmly holds the 'Squeezy Grail' in hand again.

Current TBFTG should be of an interest for fellow TAnaLyzators too. Particularly, the downtrend, as opposed to VW uptrend, serves as the core for TBFTG's application (again, refer to the dash and dash pinkish line). This core is composed of the pre-'Squeezy Grail' downtrend plus the Grail itself. Take a look at gray measurements, which cover this phase and the triangle duration - again these two follow the tendency of being proportionate in the length as phases. *Crucially, the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone again; then one more time the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, with the false first peak during the final stages of 0.618 and the proper peak at 1*.

Too many coincidences and congruences between the two TA examples discussed above, if you ask me. Especially if the fact that such events happen once in ten years or so is taken into account. Two quotes are of a relevance here:

&#x200B;

Some additional food for thought from TSLA:

[For redditors with a different floor](https://preview.redd.it/gnd0yienc2z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8b72e1671ad69cf871cde154ae386e52835e94a)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Game stopped, or it is just a beginning?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I am absolutely confident that you all know even more than myself about the fundamental factors at play for GME, so I will not bother you here with the background explanation. There is a plenty of good HQ DD all around reddit, so let's jump straight to the sweet sweet TA:

[GMESS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/ko1ppnasc2z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d3f7c2a78135696d66a0a70e8e2a34ad4a04dbf)

&#x200B;

At this point, I feel that a disclaimer is necessary. Let me briefly remind you that this analysis is a thesis, or a hypothesis that has to be proven in the future. I do believe that there is a solid probability for things to play out this way, and my beard supports my manly confidence. However, this is the market, and it all may go another way at any point in time, that's the nature of things! Think critically, learn and do your own DD and TA. In a good memory of u/ControlTheNarrative, at least.

And so, it begins. Despite it may seem that there are too many unknown or at least questionable variables for now in this GMESS TA, I believe that I was able to identify the most crucial parameters to build the core of this technical analysis's thesis, since VWSS and TSLASS provided many clues and identifiable characteristics to refer to. The first and most important one is surely the 'Purple Haze'. I should remind you, that this mystically sounding level persistently held back the price for both of the squeeze examples discussed, and only upon the breakout of this level the short squeezes were initiated. For GME this major price level seems to be at about $233 mark, with two intensive tests in Jan and Mar, which proved it to be the most significant resistance on the chart above.

Then, the shapes. The 'Squeezy Grail' (again occurring in between 78.6% and 100%) consolidation is also easily identifiable here, and it is yet again followed by the rectangular 'Runway' consolidation, where the price action currently stands. Remember, how historically (in TSLA and VW) the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurred somewhere near the spot of the current GME price action, in 0.382 Fibo time zone? Well, to paraphrase Ian Fleming: once is (VW) happenstance. Twice is (TSLA) coincidence. Three times is GMenemy action.

Fibos. Applying these two instruments to GME was real pain in the ass. Firstly, because the retracement is not usually used as a predictive instrument, being ordinarily applied to the completed trend. But since the situation is not ordinary at all, I played smarter (or more autistic, if you like). Due to the fact that the 'Purple Haze' level was approximately in between 78.6% and 100% Fibo in both of the previous examples, I assumed exactly that to be applicable here too. My belief is firmly backed up by this soft touch of 78.6% by the price action on Jan 28th. And when these two major levels were identified, the Fibo retracement horizontal grid just stretched out on GME itself.

Identifying the starting points for the trend for both Fibos was the most tricky part. After countless attempts and failures I found what I believe to be the cornerstone to the squeeze:

[Fibos' initiation point zoomed in](https://preview.redd.it/t2ouren1d2z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1cd87d96bb42ac20451c86059295f7560c8c44e8)

&#x200B;

Why? Because this                        ‚òùÔ∏è is clearly where the fun started.

And now it all matches perfectly. So, I am patiently waiting for the 'Purple Haze' to be broken. And what do you do, fellow retard?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They say, that coincidence doesn't happen a third time. I say, we shall see.

**TL;DR** is in the comments.

In brief: Nano Dimension (NNDM) creates machines that manufacture Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) with 3D printing technology. They have acquired Nano Fabrica which specializes in 3D printed mechanical components, and Deep Cube which specializes in Machine Learning, with the intention of making production of any product quicker, more efficient, and more precise. Deep Cube has collaborated with **AMD**.

In this presentation it is clear that Nano Dimension is collaborating with **NVIDIA** and **Neuralink** \- the **Elon Musk** singularity pursuit.

**This company and their technology is the future and at the same time** **speculative.**

2. This technology is, frankly, the next step in humankinds technological advancement. It's still cocooning but NNDM is taking it forwards.
3. The company is based in Israel - a lot of fuckery in there in the past months -  but things seem to be getting better now.

[Since the All Time High - NNDM has acquired 2 companies, has increased their cash to +1B and has developed their technology even further and revealed some big name customers of theirs. Still the price is $10 less than when it was a more speculative stock.](https://preview.redd.it/hketqhsega371.png?width=1755&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ea0dd7cae930fc9a3cc2781ba77c8460e4fc4a5)

**Shorts:**

1. According to Marketwatch, the Short interest of float is 11.68%
2. According to Fintel, the Short interest of float is 65%.
3. Go figure.
4. Regardless what people think, Cathie Wood is a great investor. She has been betting on NNDM for a while and praising their vision in the media. [https://cathiesark.com/ark-combined-holdings-of-nndm](https://cathiesark.com/ark-combined-holdings-of-nndm)

**Final Words**I have tried to present to you the information that has driven my approach to NNDM and their potential without presenting too many biased thoughts.

My **biased** thought are, this is the fucking future, this company is going to take our technological advancement to the next level, towards scifi shit. In short, I love what they want to do, it will be a progress but I would love to fund their efforts, although I am an Europoor.

&#x200B;

Just want to share some charts and information that I noticed while comparing AMC and GME before the squeeze

&#x200B;

So as you all know, this past week has been one for the books for AMC, from it's low on Monday, May 24th we witnessed an increase of 201% on AMC. Now this got me thinking and made me want to look back at the history of how GME started to move before it's squeeze.

&#x200B;

If you look at the candles closely, they are very very alot alike

&#x200B;

1. GME's breakout candle, on Thursday, January 13th and AMC's breakout candle, on Wednesday, May 13th are almost identical
2. After both breakouts, they traded above the bollinger bands for 3 back to back sessions
3. After GME's breakout, we saw a consolidation of price action for 5 trading sessions
4. After AMC's breakout we saw a consolidation of price action for 7 trading sessions
5. From GME's low on it's initial breakout to it's high the Friday before the squeeze, we saw on increase of 283%
6. From AMC's low on it's initial breakout to it's high the Friday before the potential squeeze, we saw an increase of 245%

&#x200B;

This is where things get interesting...

&#x200B;

The bullish candle that was formed for GME on Friday, January 22nd looks ALOT like the bullish candle formed on Thursday, May 27th for AMC

The spinning top candle that was formed for GME on Monday, Jan 25th looks alot like the spinning top candle formed on Friday, May 28th for AMC

&#x200B;

Taking into consideration the market is closed on memorial day, is this history repeating itself? If it is, that would mean the squeeze will start next week? Now I don't want to attach certain dates, I'm just sharing more information with you all. You be the judge of it.

&#x200B;

There is a TLDR after each section for more in depth details. Or a very broad TLDR at end.

# The Drone (CON)

1. ""Horse Fly"" is Work Horses last mile delivery drone launched from their delivery vehicle. Sounds great in theory and this is exactly what we expected the future to hold, right? Sure. As a consumer though do you really want your package to be dropped in your [front yard](https://youtu.be/05BaPqBXNT0?t=207) and have to walk to pick up your package or have a person put in literally in front of your door? A loud drone is also a huge ""HEY COME STEAL MY PACKAGE"" alarm.
   1. ""Horse Fly"" Me, the OP, being a student Pilot, I knew about airspaces and can Horse Fly even fly in the majority of US Airspace? Turns out they actually can, they claim on their website they have worked with the FAA to obtain permission which is a major PRO. As stated on their website: **""The HorseFly system is designed to conform to the FAA guidelines for UAV operation in the U.S. ""**
      1. However, you cannot really use this system in any densely populated area (like new york) for the simple fact you don't want drones flying around 10lb packages above thousands of humans heads all day. That's a lawsuit begging to happen.
2. The drone is limited to a 10lb payload, this even further reduces the actual amount of packagesit will be able to deliver. Ultimately this drone is pretty fucking useless as it's only use is in very sparsely populated areas or small suburban areas.

(1) **Tl;dr:**

The drones cannot be utilized everywhere in the USA, which greatly restricts their abilities considering the [majority of the US population lives in just a few different locations](http://ecpmlangues.u-strasbg.fr/civilization/geography/maps/US%20Population%20density,%202010.png) anywhere dark red would likely be unable for this drone. Drones are maintenance heavy and seem to still require human intervention. I just cant see the ultimate viability of drones compared to a human. Would be loud and attract thieves, and annoy customers.

# Continued Revenue (CON)

2.How will Work Horse continue to make money after i.e UPS buys all the trucks they want? Obviously UPS is not interested in buying the newest model every year, which means no new revenue for Work Horse. So what about maintenance? It appears as though Work Horse contracts out maintenance through Ryder Systems. [https://ryder.com/locations](https://ryder.com/locations). This would imply Work Horse will not be making money from maintenance.

1. Drone Maintenance? I haven't found anything on their website about this, but would it really be worth it for UPS to have to be constantly shipping these drones back to Work Horse for repairs and needing to keep extra drones on hand and constantly accessible? Or just pay a driver who is significantly more reliable?

&#x200B;

(2) **Tl;dr:**

Theres **no real potential for continued revenue** after workhorse sells a company their initial fleet, workhorse wont be the ones doing maintenance and the customer company wont be interested in a new fleet of the newest model each year.

&#x200B;

# Charging Costs (CON)

[reuters.com](https://reuters.com) Did an article about workhorse charging costs. **""Developing the battery plants and charging infrastructure to fund an electrified global vehicle fleet could require an investment of $2.7 trillion by manufacturers and governments "".**  Workhorse does not have anywhere near the required capital to build charging stations, which would likely leave the cost for UPS to cover. Not to mention EV doesn't change a god damn thing, we will create the electricity for the EV's by burning coal LOL [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ups-workhorse-group-electric-vehicles/ups-workhorse-electric-van-deal-shows-progress-on-charging-costs-idUSKCN1G61RZ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ups-workhorse-group-electric-vehicles/ups-workhorse-electric-van-deal-shows-progress-on-charging-costs-idUSKCN1G61RZ)

(3) T**l;dr** Infrastructure required will likely be so significantly expensive that the cost would never be recouped over any realistic time frame from the money being saved between electricity and petroleum costs by a customer company (like UPS). Besides, electricity on this size scale will be significantly more expensive than petroleum which just means you're consistently losing money by switching to an EV fleet.

&#x200B;

# Why Q4 FY 2020 Was so high (CON)

"" **Sales for the fourth quarter of 2020 were recorded at $652,000 compared to $3,000 in the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase in sales was due to a higher volume of trucks produced and delivered.** "" [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/01/2184359/0/en/Workhorse-Group-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Results.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/01/2184359/0/en/Workhorse-Group-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Results.html). The majority of this large increase was actually due to an investment workhorse made in $RIDE. The only quarters that will generate a profit is those that WKHS made a good investment or sold vehicles, they have no recurring or stable revenue source.

&#x200B;

# The MOASS (MAJOR PRO)

This stock has a huge potential for the Mother of All Short Squeezes. From [marketbeat.com](https://marketbeat.com) they claim 38.5% of workhorses shares are shorted. This is massive, and literally we just caught the shorts with their [pants down](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ns4bqz/amc_ceo_shows_us_he_isnt_wearing_pants/).

&#x200B;

# So why the fuck did you buy it then?

I bought it for the squeeze. WKHS Can gain a lot of potential with a larger capital if a squeeze were to occur.

&#x200B;

# Overall TL;DR:

Workhorse is a shit company in the long term and will never be able to scale appropriately given their current capital, but the short-term short squeeze could provide capital to allow for workhorse to build their own maintenance shops, charging stations, and dealerships around the US which will provide a stable revenue source. Currently they don't stand a chance against Amazon.

**TL;DR OF THE TL;DR:**

Company shit, short squeeze good.

20.5% of the float is short. That‚Äôs just below SPœπE (24%), Q–Ö (23.8%), and VXR–¢ (21%) and higher than –ÖRNE (20.2%), SEN–Ö (20.4%) and AMœπ(19%).   The volume is slightly below the average for the last few months. But  all it needs is a smidge of momentum and this thing could explode. Look  at the break outs the rest of  them are having, and many of those  companies aren‚Äôt making any money.

**Which brings me to my next point: PROFITABILITY**

(TL;DR for apes: They are making so much money.)

EPS is up 592% this year, and 821% Q/Q. That‚Äôs insane. Forward P/E is 9.91. EV/EBITDA is 1.7, P/S is 2.48. Let‚Äôs compare these numbers to a peer, $OCN:

–ûCN‚Äôs EPS Q/Q is  36.7%, and the stock is up 17.71% in the quarter. UWMœπ‚Äôs EPS Q/Q is up 821% and the stock is only up 1.37%. Any guesses why? *–ûCN‚Äôs short float is only 1.24%****.*** *UWMœπ‚Äôs is 20%*. Hmm....

**$300M Share Buyback**

May Q1 Earnings Quote: ‚ÄúAs you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of   $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I   always¬†explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special dividend or a share buyback program. As you guys have seen, we¬†concluded share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward shareholders. We announced the authorization of $300 million share buyback over the next 24 months. And¬†quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that.‚Äù

**Dividend**

Remember, ‚ÄúIt costs nothing for me to hold, but it costs them to short?‚Äù Well on this one, you actually *get paid to hold*. **4.5% per year** at the current price. And would you look at that, we‚Äôve got a quarterly dividend ex-date coming up on June 9th, $0.10/share.

**Insider buying**

One insider, Robert Verdun (director), dropped half a million on shares at  $7.87. Insiders sell for many reasons, but there‚Äôs only one reason they buy. And we‚Äôre not far above his purchase price right now. The CEO, Mat Ishbia, has committed to not selling his shares anytime in the near future as well.

**Earnings**

Expected sometime in August/ September. Earnings expectations have already been raised once in the last 30 days, 2-3 months out. I could see this running up to earnings.

104,FORD,nhmv7n,2021-05-21 09:40:32,FORD DD - $F - Don't worry about debt,"Ford is great value investment considering it will compete with TESLA for EV market - Most of bear case is ford debt and they are 100% wrong. Please read below article.

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford‚Äôs finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford‚Äôs automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford‚Äôs $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford‚Äôs $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

**13.24** is key support now, keep an eye on that.

We have been coiling under key resistance for a few days (**14.53) THE SECOND THIS BREAKS, WE ARE CLEAR FOR TAKEOFF (AGAIN).** Also - note the way we are coiling upwards below key resistance is a very bullish data point. Volume is declining as we chop up.

Price targets are **17.25 & 20.36.**

This is the best setup I've seen in this stock since the initial squeeze. Remember, keep it simple.

***TL;DR -*** AMC actually looks good for once from an **unbiased** technical standpoint

\- Research coming out of John Hopkins University is suggesting that the use of Psilocybin is the most effective drug ever tested as a remedy for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. As the United States is currently under crisis in its battle against mental illness, these results are too impressive to ignore, even if it may need to overcome pressures from big pharma interest groups that seek to quell the expansion of this research.

\- These drugs have been extremely effective in treating addiction -- particularly alcohol and nicotine. Considering the government expenditure on the opioid crisis, once this proves to be an effective treatment, the government will expedite the medicinal legalization of the substances that MNMD has been treating/experimenting with.

\- Veterans, the most respected occupational category (statistically,) have begun launching advocacy groups for the widespread medicinal legalization of these substances due to their effectiveness against PTSD. These therapeutic measures have contributed to the plummeting of suicide rates (those treated w/ psilocybin vs. control group.) The Biden administration will have to choose ethics and reason over the suffering of veterans (former government employees) which I anticipate that they will given mounting pressure due to the effectiveness of these treatments.

&#x200B;

Does this hinge on expected earnings in the long-run ... certainly!

&#x200B;

But the effectiveness of this research is undeniable and can no longer be overlooked ... because of new cultural acceptance of these alternative treatments the government's hand will be forced in legalize, or otherwise be responsible for mental illness and addiction -- all of which could be treated and cured.

117,RNG,nthp3b,2021-06-06 11:11:28,"DD RNG potential if compared with Hydrogen &amp; BEVs, USA (California) regulatory and legislative focus","Hello everyone, 

here a DD focused on RNG and Natural Gas developments in the USA, as previous one was more broad and had the intention to outline the state of the industry worldwide.

As you may know, California has always been at the center of attention as the most advanced state in terms of decarbonization efforts. Yet, it seems that not all decisions paid back in terms of quality of life and certainty of business activity.

**Californian** **Natural Gas power plants shut down, electricity imported from other states:**

Indeed, California, different from what someone would expect, has not a good and reliable supply of electricity, probably because it pushed too aggressively for the state's 100% electrification goal (see attached picture). During the most recent blackout in August 2020, some Electric buses were forced to shut down, in order to reduce electricity demand. In the next decade, virtual power plants' alike experiments will be more popular, therefore it is reasonable to expect a better match between the demand & supply of green electricity. But it will take time and for safety reasons, it would be better to rely on different sources of energy.

* [2020-08-21 Washington Examiner: California forced to defend green goals amid blackouts](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/california-forced-to-defend-green-goals-amid-blackouts)
* [2020-08-23 Oil & Gas 360 : Green California has the nation's worst power grid](https://www.oilandgas360.com/green-california-has-the-nations-worst-power-grid/)

The first question that arises, reading these topics, is about the never-ending announcements of companies like Nikola $NKLA (very dubious business potential) and Tesla $TSLA (amazing company with incredible potential) about the incoming, quick and easy electrification of Heavy Duty Transports.

**Hydrogen Alternative Focus**

Nikola revealed its lack of technological breakthrough when it was revealed that General Motors had the intention to market a Hydrogen trucks with the Nikola brand and...... GM Fuel Cells!! The drama related to the CEO trials made the rest. I am a huge fan of hydrogen , but as Cummins $CMI CEO confirmed, hydrogen trucks have a long long way to go before being adopted on a large scale (please note that [Cummins acquired Hydrogenics in Sept. 2019](https://www.cummins.com/news/releases/2019/09/09/cummins-closes-its-acquisition-hydrogenics) (second global leader after $BLDP in hydrogen fuel cells). According to Cummins and others, in the next years electrolyzer segment will grow first. Note that the hydrogen fuel needed for hypothetical trucks on California's road would need green hydrogen, thus it will put more stress on the grid.. Even if it is not focused on the US, I recommend readers this report of David Fickling about global green hydrogen potential by 2050. 

[According to David Fickling](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/the-hydrogen-economys-time-is-approaching/2020/05/08/383b1a04-9191-11ea-9322-a29e75effc93_story.html), hydrogen could meet 24% of the world‚Äôs energy needs by 2050, but it would likely take 31‚Äô320 TWh of electricity to hit this level. Last year, the entire world generated just roughly 26‚Äô000 TWh, of which 10‚Äô000 were coming from zero-carbon sources. By 2050 it may be achievable, but there are shorter deadlines for the transport sector. Actions today are required to match 2025 and 2030 emission targets.

If we want a high percentage of **green hydrogen**, a huge amount of grid investments is required today; high-tension grid infrastructure needs 5-10 years to be completed, therefore it is reasonable to say that hydrogen will be a sound reality for mobility from the late 2020‚Äôs on, not earlier. In addition, the potential of exhausted salt mines that could store hydrogen for months is just theoretical for now.

It is worth to remember that the sources for electricity generation in Europe are diversified and are not ready for a 100% renewable energy scenario:

* **Germany renounced to nuclear power** in 2011 and will renounce to coal by 2030, and the country is massively investing in gas pipelines, so it is very likely that it will not renounce to Russian gas.
* **France relies heavily on nuclear power**, with some of these power plants being soon too old to remain active. Therefore, traditional gas generation will be a ¬†likely alternative to overcome this problem.
* **The UK closed all its coal power plants** but decided to keep open nuclear and gas facilities.
* **Italy** relies heavily on gas and does not have any nuclear power plant.

None of Europe‚Äôs largest countries can afford a 100% green electricity sector that can satisfy both current demand plus the incremental demand coming from the green hydrogen sector. Therefore, some fossil fuel (natural gas) and nuclear plants are here to stay for the longer term.

**BLUE HYDROGEN CANNOT BE IGNORED -** The argument is different if we include in the discussion blue hydrogen along with carbon capture. In this scenario, we would need massive incentives and research investments in carbon capture technology, which now are still at an early stage. According to the European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen, [who spoke at the World Economic Forum in January 2020](https://www.ft.com/content/c93694c8-3d15-11ea-a01a-bae547046735), the EU will define the structure of a continental carbon tax by the end of this year (pre-COVID-19 intention, very likely now that the details will be published in 2021). For this reason, large trade partners like the US and China were advised to start their own studies on the tax, if they do not want their goods to be taxed at the highest possible carbon emission rate.

**HYDROGEN TRAIN FOCUS**¬†\- An interesting case in this regard is the Hydrogen train developed by Alstom and Hydrogenics (now Cummins Inc.) whose adoption has been delayed considerably. Alstom was able to sell its innovative product to some German and French regions. Nevertheless, in most of the cases hydrogen will come from fossil sources (Rhyne region etc.), with cleaner alternatives being provided at a later stage. In the region of Schleswig Holstein, where the green potential was massive, Alstom could have got the greatest commercial order for a hydrogen product worldwide; however, the green fueling station was at the heart of a controversy between the company and the tender offer authorities of Schleswig-Holstein. For this reason, 52 trains were allocated to the battery train manufacturer and the Alstom (Hydrogenics) & NEL consortium lost the tender offer. The proposed fueling station was massive for the time, being around 20 MW capacity, [but the cost of it was at the expense of the consortium](https://www.ln-online.de/Lokales/Lauenburg/Aus-fuer-die-Wasserstoffzelle-auf-der-Schiene).

**BEV Infrastructure focus**

Tesla instead kept postponing the launch of its Tesla SEMI. You can read again the last conference call transcripts which clearly states that the biggest issue from a product perspective is the fast charger technology, whose time of realization and commercialization is yet unknown. From a macro perspective instead is unclear how California may afford to charge thousands of Tesla SEMI with its current electricity grid.

**How does $CLNE fits into all this?**

 If you look at 2020 Q2 CC of $CLNE , management made a quite useful comparison for H2 fueling stations and BEV charging stations for heavy-duty. They told the story of a recharging facility in Los Angeles that was going to be built for $5.5 million to recharge 24 heavy-duty trucks in a day‚Äôs time, in like 20-hour time, using the equivalent of the electricity needed for 44‚Äô000 homes (!!!). Thus, it is reasonable to expect not many fleet operators to switch soon to BEV trucks.¬†

About hydrogen refueling, management commented on the experience they got operating a hydrogen station in California with on-site hydrogen generation through electrolysis:

‚Äú*Get a load of this, it requires about 20 gallons of water (each gallon is 3.785 liters) for every gallon of hydrogen you produce. So march that out on a nationwide scale. And the idea that we're going to do it with renewable sources at a station is going to be very daunting, okay?*

*I think that as you look at commercial truck stops with hydrogen, you're probably looking at something on the order of $15 million to $20 million, or more, per station. So this is a very expensive proposition because you're basically creating a whole new network. And really, the most successful stations around the world, and there's only a handful of hydrogen, is you're reforming natural gas.‚Äù*

It is clear why some fleet operators are switching to Natural Gas Trucks. Amazon in February and the Port of LA recently, with the decision to equate BEV and other Zero Emission trucks to the Natural Gas ones. 

**US Congress ""Californification"" , not so fast**

In the past legislative period, there were some bipartisan attempts to support RNG and Natural Gas mobility. US Congress has indeed shown some interest in the subject. Last June, a bipartisan effort was introduced in both the chambers of the US congress. The bill is called ‚Äú[Growing Climate Solutions Act](https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/09/10/growing-climate-solutions-act-gives-farmers-a-seat-at-the-carbon-market-table/)‚Äù and would allow farmers to generate revenue streams from different forms of carbon capture. Most notably, methane from livestock is mentioned in the legislation. If enacted at ¬†the federal level, decarbonized gas would receive a renovated interest from many different stakeholders. [Being a bipartisan deal](https://www.audubon.org/news/indiana-senator-mike-braun-discusses-bipartisan-climate-solutions-young-leaders), as farmers represent a prized electoral category, it should be enacted regardless of the next election results.

President Biden needs to show to his party and the American people that he is doing something about the environment. That is why he advertised the Ford BEV pickup and keeps saying that government's fleets will be electrified. As always, the political reality is much more complex than the headline announcements, and RNG has a lot of room to grow in this space. 

[Already in 2020, RNG represented 53% of all Natural Gas used in transport in the USA](https://bioenergyinternational.com/markets-finance/rng-surpassed-ng-accounting-for-53-percent-of-us-on-road-ngv-fuel-use-in-2020) . As noted in a previous DD, in California RNG is 90% of NG used in transport.

Let me know if you have further questions!

# Full Breakdown of CLOV Valuation

To understand what CLOV should be worth today, look at [OSH](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/OSH/) and [AGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AGL?p=AGL&.tsrc=fin-srch). Not only did all three companies go public within the last year, but they are all similar-sized [Direct Contracting Entities](https://innovation.cms.gov/innovation-models/gpdc-model) (DCE) competing for ""lives under management"" *(Note: you'll see companies report this number using the term patients, members, or beneficiaries. They're all equivalent)*. This term simply means Medicare patients that the company is financially +/- clinically responsible for. Medicare pays $850+ per beneficiary per month for these companies to take on the risk of managing their healthcare costs. You can think of it as a lower margin (5-10% EBITDA) Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model that generates stable recurring revenue on a monthly basis for each patient being managed.

CLOV started out as a Medicare Advantage (MA) insurance plan, which is pretty similar to Direct Contracting (DC). That's because [the DC model was designed based on the MA model](https://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/view/cms-direct-contracting-model---is-it-still-one-of-the-value-based-models-built-on-fee-for-service-chasis-) by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). CMS launched the DC program in April 2021, and CLOV, OSH, and AGL among the first 53 organizations approved.

OSH does a good job of explaining how the Medicare Advantage market (and now the DC market) works:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t0utrzxkgp371.png?width=887&format=png&auto=webp&s=f68cd3b940c33b8c41e51c51cd270e8f7208cd8e

MA Plans are insurance companies that partner with specific healthcare providers to help manage the cost of their patients. The MA plan gets the $850+ monthly payment, and is [required by law to spend at least 85%](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2013/05/23/2013-12156/medicare-program-medical-loss-ratio-requirements-for-the-medicare-advantage-and-the-medicare) of it on medical costs. They usually do this by giving 85% of the $850+ monthly payment to the healthcare provider, and thereby transfer the risk of unexpectedly high costs to the provider caring for the patient. The DC model works the same, except Medicare pays the Direct Contracting Entity (DCE) $850+ monthly. What's interesting about DC is that any type of organization can be a DCE. CLOV is an insurance company (MA plan) that creates networks of healthcare providers for their plan members. AGL is a Management Service Organization (MSO) that provides services to healthcare providers that care for Medicare Advantage patients. And OSH *is* a healthcare provider that operates brick-and-mortar clinics focused on Medicare Advantage patients.

Medicare Advantage represents [26 million Americans](https://www.medicareresources.org/medicare-benefits/medicare-advantage/), accounting for about 36 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries. The DC program was launched by CMS so that Medicare Advantage companies like CLOV, AGL, and OSH could help manage the other 46 million Medicare beneficiaries in order to transition away from fee-for-service healthcare. **It's a huge deal.**

Below I'll break down the key numbers driving the valuation of these three companies for their Medicare Advantage business. The DC business is obviously new, but I'll predict what the valuations will look like in DC afterward. **The most important thing to understand here is that the valuation for all three of these companies is the number of lives under management multiplied by a dollar amount. The dollar amount is the market saying how much they believe in the company's ability to profitably manage those patients.**

Disclaimer: I'm not saying all three companies should be valued exactly the same. I am arguing that the dollar amount per managed life should be within a much tighter window because the gross margin for managing a Medicare life (MA or DC) will always end up in a very tight window (5-10% of revenue) no matter what model you deploy.

**OSH = $14.3B market cap**

OSH is obviously liked the most by the market based on their valuation. It's partly because they run the clinics so they can keep more of the Medicare dollar (instead of splitting it with the healthcare provider that takes on the risk). Employing clinicians also allows them to theoretically do more to improve health outcomes and control costs. In this model, the MA Plan takes 15% off the top, and the rest goes to OSH.

* **OSH gross margin = 6.7%** ([source](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/osh/financials))
* **75,500 total managed lives growing to 112,000 this year** ([source](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/oak-street-health-projects-strong-growth-2021-despite-64m-loss-q1))
* **That's a valuation of $125,000 per patient**

**AGL = $14.3B market cap**

AGL holds the contract with the MA plan and then pays the contracted (not employed) healthcare provider. In this model, the MA Plan takes 15% of the premium off the top, and the rest is split between AGL and the provider practices.

* **AGL gross margin = 7%** ([source](https://capital.com/agilon-health-ipo-will-the-stock-soar-in-2021))
* **165,300 total risk-based patients growing to 210,000 this year** ([source](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-agilon-health-ipo/healthcare-platform-agilon-valued-at-about-11-billion-in-nyse-debut-idUSKBN2C22D7))
* **That's a valuation of $66,667 per patient**

**CLOV = $3.65B market cap**

CLOV has historically been just a MA plan, taking the 15% of the premium off the top and paying the rest to cover the patient's costs ([source](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2013/05/23/2013-12156/medicare-program-medical-loss-ratio-requirements-for-the-medicare-advantage-and-the-medicare)). MA plans have an average profit margin of 4.3% after all their admin and sales expenses are accounted for ([source](https://mhk.com/medicare-advantage-is-the-golden-egg-for-health-plans/)).

* **CLOV historical gross margin (before COVID effect) = 2.5-4.1 %** ([source](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/static-files/ed2bc09d-cd96-4759-897e-862c2b250213))
* **132,000 total risk-based patients growing to 160,000 this year** ([source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/17/2230595/0/en/Clover-Health-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results.html))
* **That's a valuation of $22,800 per patient**

**AGL is a good preview of how the DC market could be valued per Medicare patient, except the DC model could be even better. There is no MA plan taking 15% off the top in between the risk-bearer (Direct Contracting Entity: CLOV, AGL, or OSH) and Medicare. Direct Contracting patients could be valued as high as $76,667 (15% premium over current AGL patients).**

The CEO of OSH was recently quoted ""**the per-patient economics of that program will potentially be better than the company had initially estimated""** ([source](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/oak-street-health-projects-strong-growth-2021-despite-64m-loss-q1))**.**

Here are the number of Medicare patients enrolled by each DCE (since the program launched in April 2021):

* **OSH: 6,500** managed lives ([source](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/oak-street-health-projects-strong-growth-2021-despite-64m-loss-q1))
* **AGL**: **50,000** managed lives ([source](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001831097/98fb566d-8f47-4a36-bd48-6bef5745cf56.pdf))
* **CLOV: 65,000** managed lives ([source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/17/2230595/0/en/Clover-Health-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results.html))

Hopefully now those valuation ranges I presented at the top make a little more sense to you.

//

# Here's an outline of how the Clover Assistant (CA) platform improves treatment decisions and risk adjustment for the provider:

* **More informed doctors delivering better treatment and care**
   * CA will make treatment recommendations using evidence-based guidelines
   * Primary care providers manage so many different conditions, it's impossible for them to keep up with all the medical literature
   * CA will present the latest evidence-based guidelines as simple recommendations, so that the primary care provider doesn't have to stay up-to-date on the most advanced treatment pathways for every condition
* **More accurate documentation for higher Medicare payments (MA and DC)**
   * The monthly $850+ payment to MA and DC organizations is adjusted based on the patient's risk score (basically how many health conditions they have)
   * The risk score is calculated using diagnosis codes (ICD-10 codes) that are entered into the electronic health record (EHR) by the doctor and eventually included in the insurance claim that goes to the MA plan (and Medicare)
   * Providers often forget to include all the codes in the insurance claim, or even sometimes forget to properly document it in the EHR
   * Providers also forget to re-document codes on an annual basis, because on January 1 all of the diagnosis codes are erased in Medicare's risk score calculation because some diagnoses can change (e.g. cancer remission)
      * This sounds stupid, but if a diabetic patient has an amputated foot, Medicare acts like it grows back on Jan 1 and the doctor has to document the diagnosis again
      * Medicare is either too lazy to discern between permanent vs reversible conditions, and/or they like that they get to pay less for an inaccurately lower risk score
   * When providers forget to include one or more codes, that means the risk score will be lower and the premium received by the MA plan will be lower
   * CLOV's software analyzes data from the EHR as well as past claims to identify diagnosis codes that are missing from the current claim, and asks the provider if they still have the condition to see if the doctor simply forgot to document the code
   * CLOV's software also analyzes EHR and claims data to identify potentially missing diagnosis codes and asks the doctor if the patient ever had a certain condition using evidence-based guidelines
      * Example: blood pressure reading > 140/90 (threshold in hypertension guidelines) but no hypertension diagnosis code documented

&#x200B;

# 

# Why is CLOV Undervalued?

**Part 1: Hindenburg Report (February 2021)**

* Hindenburg does research for short hedge funds. The [report](https://hindenburgresearch.com/clover/) revealed a DOJ investigation into CLOV that was previously undisclosed. The day after the report was released, an SEC investigation was initiated into CLOV based on the report. The report had a number of unrelated claims on shady marketing practices, undisclosed business relationships, and ""upcoding"".
* Probably the most serious accusation of them all is the one about ""upcoding"". If this is true, it's Medicare fraud. The number one rule in the Medicare industry is DON'T OVERBILL MEDICARE. In the case of CLOV, I seriously doubt there is any upcoding going on based on how their software works. The Clover Assistant (CA) software doesn't have the ability to change any codes. It just makes recommendations. The doctor has to manually do it for regulatory *and* patient safety reasons. There are other population health tools out there that do this exact thing. Often times when upcoding is being investigated, it's because the Medicare fee-for-service claims suggest a much lower risk score. However, that's because providers don't document most codes in fee-for-service claims because they don't get paid to spend the extra time. When the patient then enrolls in a MA plan or DC program, all of a sudden [their risk score shoots up](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20170519/NEWS/170519815/doj-s-medicare-advantage-lawsuits-investigations-likely-to-change-insurance-culture) because the MA/DC organization and provider get paid based on risk.
* Regarding the other accusations, [CLOV released a point-by-point response](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000119312521029637/d66346dex991.htm) the day after the report came out. I thought they addressed everything sufficiently. From an investor's perspective, it all comes down to what the DOJ finds. I'd be very surprised if Chamath's counsel and the third-party counsel involved in the SPAC ignored or did not look into illegal practices during due diligence. This was one of Chamath's first SPACs and he knew was launching many more. If you mess up due diligence once, the rest of your SPACs become worthless.
* **Regarding the BS about the CEO Vivek Garripali**, he bought 3 hospitals in bankruptcy and assumed their debt almost 10 years ago. He quickly found out why they were in so much debt. The health insurance companies offer such limited coverage and almost exclusively to high income neighborhoods. So, if their insuree visited a hospital or clinic or anything outside of their coverage area, the insurance company would refuse to pay the hospitals fees or only agree to paying a small portion. So the medical facility ultimately ends up assuming the debt and this eventually snowballs. Anyways. Vivek began charging these insurance companies high premiums on the accounts he could collect on in an attempt to make up for the losses for patients they wouldn't pay for. This is where they try and paint him as a villain. Long story short. He sold the the hospitals and created Clover Health in order to solve this corrupt problem throughout the health insurance industry. For his time and money invested. He didn't make money as much as he learned from this experience. So a big part of Clover's mission is offering widespread coverage to their insurees. These big insurance companies are hating this. Hence much of the hate for Clover.

&#x200B;

**Part 2: DC Enrollment Numbers (May 2021)**

* CLOV announced their initial Direct Contracting (DC) enrollment numbers in their most recent quarterly report. The 65,000 DC patients were far below the 200,000 that the market was expecting. There was obviously a miscommunication between CLOV and the market. CLOV stated they had *access* to 200,000 Medicare patients through their network of 1,800 providers using their software. Analysts took that as a projection of enrollment. They still have access to all those patients and will enroll them over time. My guess is they were able to do [claims-based alignment](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/direct-contracting-summary) for much of the initial 65,000 DC patients, which is automatic. Now they have to market this program to the other $135,000 DC patients to get them enrolled via [voluntary alignment](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/direct-contracting-summary) (i.e. consent). They could also market the MA plan which has more benefits. That's the power of CLOV having a network of providers contracted with its DCE and MA plan.
* This lower DC patient enrollment has now been priced in with analysts adjusting down to an average price target of [$9.33](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CLOV/research-ratings). These price targets are based on extremely conservative enrollment projections and revenue projections from CLOV for their DC business.
* They set forecasts at 70,000 to 100,000 by end of 2021. *They already have 65,000 enrolled in April*. They intentionally set expectations extremely low to absorb the negative market reaction upfront and then outperform going forward. They also reported extremely low revenue projections for the DC patients. They're only projecting [$20M - $30M](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-health-reports-first-quarter-2021-financial-results) for the year.
* I would guess that their **profits** from the DC market this year could be $25M+ (5% margin x 65,000 patients x $850 x 9 months). Revenue should be similar to Medicare Advantage at $850+ per patient per month. That's at least $55M in Medicare payments per month for 65,000 DC patients.
* They did state that ""[GAAP revenue estimates for Direct Contracting are dependent on the finalization of accounting treatment, which we expect will be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2021](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-health-reports-first-quarter-2021-financial-results)"".

**Part 3: Differentiation**

* CLOV does have a virtuous cycle built into its business. It's all based on their relationship with their provider network. When they contract with a healthcare provider, they give them access to the Clover Assistant (CA) for free. CA is a software platform that analyzes electronic health record (EHR) and claims data to provide decision support back to the provider at the point of care.
* The CA platform is a population health tool. There are competing software solutions in the market. The difference here is that the provider has to pay for access to those tools. CLOV pays the provider to use the CA platform. CLOV pays **$200** per visit, which is much higher than the average [$121.45](https://truecostofhealthcare.org/medicare_part_b/) that other MA plans pay.
* The reason that CLOV pays the provider to use it is because it improves the top and bottom line for CLOV. CA helps providers make better treatment decisions and document risk scores more accurately, which results in higher Medicare payments (to CLOV and the provider). Higher Medicare payments directly increases the top line revenue. Better treatment decisions lead to lower costs, which allows CLOV (MA plan or DCE) to keep more Medicare dollars. If you're interested in how CA works, I'll include some bulletpoints at the bottom of the post.
* **Happy providers are key to increasing the number of lives managed long term.** Providers are directly involved in the ""alignment"" process for DC enrollment, and their opinion is highly respected when making a recommendation around which MA plan a patient should choose. As CLOV grows its provider network, it will increase enrollment for both MA and DC. It will also lead to more CA software users, more software users usually leads to better experience and insights, which could reinforce itself and bring more providers onboard.

# Risks to CLOV

Below are the biggest risks I see for CLOV, in order of importance:

**1.** **DOJ Investigation**

As I mentioned above, I don't think there were illegal practices going on at CLOV that management, Chamath, or the third-party counsel were aware of. It's still possible the DOJ investigation finds something. This happens all the time in the Medicare industry, including to the biggest names ([UnitedHealth, Humana,](https://www.whistleblowerattorneys.com/blog/whistleblower-unitedhealth-medicare-advantage-fraud) [Cigna](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/doj-cigna-medicare-advantage-fraud-lawsuit/583023/), etc.).

All the MA plans learn from each other's missteps. CLOV has been operating an MA plan for over 5 years now. They were [fined $106,095 in 2016](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payer/cms-fines-clover-health-for-misleading-marketing-tactics) for 'misleading' marketing tactics. *They haven't been fined since*. They have also gone through multiple rounds of funding from top venture capitalists and Google. There's been no shortage of due diligence on this company.

Yet, there is always the risk that someone somewhere was doing something illegal this time. If that is the case, it will likely end up in a lawsuit. I've seen many cases get to this stage and then get dismissed by a federal judge ([UnitedHealth 1](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/antifraud/unitedhealthcare-medicare-advantage-fraud-suit-department-justice), [UnitedHealth 2](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payer/department-justice-unitedhealth-medicare-advantage-fraud), ). Worst case scenario for the company, there is a settlement. Here are examples of MA plans paying settlements for ""upcoding"" fraud cases:

* UnitedHealth (2017): [$32M](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/antifraud/florida-insurers-pay-32m-to-settle-medicare-advantage-fraud-case)
* Kaiser Permanente (2020): [$6.3M](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/medicare-advantage-provider-pay-63-million-settle-false-claims-act-allegations)
* Humana (2021): [$12.5M](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/payer-issues/humana-roche-settle-false-claims-lawsuit-for-12-5m.html)

The largest settlement ever was [$270M](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/medicare-advantage-provider-pay-270-million-settle-false-claims-act-liabilities) by HealthCare Partners (now part of UnitedHealth) in 2018. This was because the providers themselves were submitting false codes (not the health plan). All of these settlements are for ""upcoding"". Again, among all the accusations, I would be most surprised if CLOV was actually doing this. If anything, the Clover Assistant should result in better documentation around the codes because that's what it's designed to do.

No matter how cynical a view you want to take on the DOJ investigation, CLOV has no debt and $700M in cash from the SPAC proceeds, so a settlement should not significantly impact them.

**2.** **SEC Investigation**

The SEC investigation was announced the day after the Hindenburg report came out. The SEC is investigating whether the DOJ inquiries were material enough to require disclosure to the market. The investigation may not be closed until the DOJ inquiries have been resolved. If the SEC determines there should have been a disclosure, there will likely be a fine. I'm not an expert on SEC enforcement. The only thing I could point to would be the $20M fine Elon Musk paid for announcing a fake acquisition at a much higher price at the time. He picked $420 as the fake number, not sure why...

**3. Market Multiple**

Valuations based on profitability could be hurt in the short term. Medical costs are higher this year due to delayed care during COVID-19, so all companies in this space will have compressed margins in the short-term. I believe growth is more important than profitability in this market when you're looking at <1% of DC patients enrolled. CLOV has proven to be exceptional at growth and has proven it both in MA and now DC.

There could also be a general downturn in market sentiment, and these growth stocks with low margins would be affected the most. However, Medicare is a very stable business and these companies will continue to grow independent of economic conditions.

&#x200B;

# The Meme-Stock Correlation, Short Interest, and Gamma Squeeze setup

To keep this short and sweet - CLOV was originally identified by WSB & Stocktwitters for the short interest being reported over 100% at one point.  This is due to several miscalculations but the idea is true that SI is not being correctly reported.  It is estimated to be over 50% but is reported around 40% on Ortex.  This has been the main area of interest in relation to meme stocks.

# How did CLOV get caught up in all the meme madness?

Well..  if you dont remember, back in January, chamath palihapitiya encouraged retail investors, along with elon musk, to buy and SQUEEZE GME + AMC.

[GME squeezes from 60 to over 150 the next day on this Tweet](https://preview.redd.it/quoosh9nup371.png?width=1176&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a0b3d8969d37920eee6947d97ac8585eaea345d)

[but this helped too](https://preview.redd.it/qucv5j9tup371.png?width=1182&format=png&auto=webp&s=88e306406085ab9fc59d787bd3ab2381a52df689)

He made himself an enemy of hedgefunds who lost on these bets.  So when they doubled down their shorts on gme / amc - they went after chammaths stock, CLOV.  But they fucked up.  They doubled down and shorted it to shit because they lost money because of him.

With great fundamentals, **the short thesis is based on one thing alone - the HindenTurd report -** and guess what that is?  bullshit.

# 

# Did you mention Gamma Squeeze??

yes I did.   I even googled it for you apes.

https://preview.redd.it/9zj5oopi54471.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=61a66d109aec1738dece49345df43c974a18bc04

So basically, look at the **open interest** on each Strike.  Each new strike that goes in the money has to get hedged.  So basically multiply the open interest x 100 for each strike.  

[woops..  well we got them all in the money lol, so now we wait for shorts to cover... \(edit\)](https://preview.redd.it/is8dlv9ewp371.png?width=1576&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8053c02d47b4b92c351b11b47875a53adb94cd9)

* Is a Gamma Squeeze possible?
   * Yes.
* is a Short Squeeze possible?
   * Yes.
* Will either of the above happen?
   * IDK.
* but someone paid to see the FINTEL short squeeze score, its 93 / 100

[since short sellers are all under water now that the price is at ATH..  if they get margin called, it will take 5 days to cover, 5 days of pain, 5 days of gain.](https://preview.redd.it/yufdby0b54471.jpg?width=288&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=332cfdb2c0b9f4ddd09eecd4979f964b2a221d2b)

&#x200B;

# TLDR:

* **Should be between 15-22$ at current valuation.**
* Clover Health is basically Medicare insurance for old people meets AI tech (the clover assistant for doctors) it‚Äôs a huge healthcare disruptor.
* They have 45+% year over year growth, zero debt, 700 mill in cash, 105% institutional ownership with a super low float..
* 30$ IS EXPECTED for the CEO to ever profit... and chammath said it‚Äôs a 10x in 10 years company.
* Shorted to oblivion by Hindenburg & short sellers who attacked this one in particular because Chamath encouraged amc / gme retail interest..
* Short interest is likely above 50% and it seems to have a gamma squeeze setup in the options chain.
* The short thesis is based on the HindenTurd report which is based on some üåà üêª shit.

# CATALYSTS FOR PRICE ACTION:

* June 25. Russell 2000 index inclusion, will force 70 million in shares purchased for ETF's that track it.
* further discussion of reduced Medicare age or related
* public announcement Clearing of the DOJ / SEC inquiries.. ***this ones HUGE for fucking up the short thesis at its core...***
* future earnings & enrollment #‚Äôs, (every time they beat numbers will be great...)
* clover assistant updates
* I‚Äôm sure other things like great PR will eventually come out hopefully more from Chamath and the Clinton.

**The millennials case for $UWMC:**

Stock Deeply Undervalued: millennials love stocks that hedgies have (allegedly) artificially pushed down the price. UWM is a growing company and Wall Street has positioned itself as if UWM is shrinking.

Share Buybacks: millennials will recognize this buyback is different then say Apple. With $300 million in buybacks, UWM can reduce the whole float by almost 40%.

Option Open Interest: There are 131,934 open interest in options (as of this morning) with strikes at $10 and under. That is a lot of shares that the sellers of those options would need to find. The float could be reduced significantly by share buybacks at that time. Institutional investors easily control 20+million shares and they aren't selling at these prices. Gores holds 15.8m shares they bought for $10 a few months ago.

CEO: Mat is pissed Wall Street doesn't love his company as much as he does. He will do what it takes to get the price to what he needs it to be with the buybacks. He is game to play.

**The boomer case for $UWMC:**

Mortgages: Boomers love mortgages, the bigger the better. UWM is the largest wholesale mortgage provider in America. The mortgage industry isn't going anywhere and boomer's small brains can at least understand that.

Healthy Financials: UWM runs a tight ship and is very profitable. It also trades at a low P/E around 6 or so. Boomers love low P/E's cause they hate tech and tech is ""expensive"". They buy low P/E companies like T cause they are much smarter than millennials at investing.

Dividends: Boomers love dividends. They think it is free money. At a $7.5 stock price $UWMC pays a 5.3% dividend. But even better, UWM pays a dividend on its class A shares only. Class A is only 7% of the outstanding shares, so it costs UWM $42 million to pay a 5.3% dividend. For context, their net income Q1 was $800m+.

Share Buybacks: Boomers love getting their capital returned in a slow, and boring way. UWMC has a $300 million share buyback underway right now.

Mat Ishbia: Mat is a CEO boomers love. He played team sports and won an NCAA national championship riding the bench at Michigan State. Boomers love reading stories like that because they always preached hard work to their own kids from the couch.

So either a short term or long term investment, boomer or millenial, $UWMC looks interesting.",DD,0.88
122,BB,nqsgln,2021-06-02 20:20:02,$BB üçáüçá,"People underestimate Blackberry's QNX operating system as a secure RTOS (Real Time Operating System) based off of microkernel architecture. üöÄ

For those who don't know how a RTOS microkernel operates let's explain with minor detail. QNX is one of the most adopted embedded OS's in the world it's installed in defense systems, power plants, municipal grids, robotics, rockets, rail and 175 million vehicles and rising.üöÄ

The reason for it's adoption is because of the way a QNX Neutrino RTOS operates compared to what we consider typical everyday operating systems. Most operating systems including IOS, Windows, Linux(Android) and MacOS to name the most apparent run on monolithic designs or hybrid kernels.üöÄ

A true microkernel architecture like QNX Neutrino RTOS has full memory protection which is built in meaning that any component can fail and be restarted without corrupting the microkernel or other components in the system. If failure does occur, QNX has the ability to rectify the problem without affecting any other part of the system through process monitoring and recovery components. This feature and ability equals extreme reliability, security and being a microkernel the OS is also modular.üöÄ

So what is the big deal your probably asking, Apple, ABC, and Microsoft might enter the space? Not exactly, in fact there has been work in this space from all three companies. Apple opened a facility across from QNX in Kanata and hired the ex creator of the OS Dan Dodge in 2016 to work with Mansfield on the autonomous car project called project Titan. The need for a secure and stable software is where Dodge and his decades of experience from QNX come into play.üöÄ

The need for a software system as reliable and secure as QNX should be a big flag to the sheer potential of QNX. It is clearly a threat and tough competition for even the biggest software companies. Not only this but project Titan continues to be illusive revealing possible setbacks and interference in trying to compete but also Apple lost several top managers from it's Apple Car project causing a potential setback to the launch revealing some attrition in the project.üöÄ

QNX version (7.1) is years ahead and analysts predict the next competitor is still 5 years away from anything even remotely close.  QNX hypervisor 2.0 is 61508 SIL 3 certified and¬†has been recognized as ISO 26262 ASIL D compliant making it the world's first ASIL D safety-certified commercial hypervisor. üöÄ

As other's race to catch up, BlackBerry has been filing patents on it's system.üöÄ

The QNX Hypervisor utilizes patented and patent-pending technologies that simplifies how elements are shared on the system. Multiple OS's can use 1 display controller to render content onto multiple displays, aka digital instrument clusters and infotainment.üöÄ",DD,0.94

Remember what happened the last time a stock had borrow rates this high? Everyone seems to be bashing CLOV as a distraction from other stocks but to me it looks like after the price spike yesterday the shorts have doubled down on their position.

Since CLOV reached its ATH from the activity yesterday new short positions had to be opened in order for hedge funds to prevent further losses. The shorts are already under a lot of pressure as the share price is higher than any of their previous short positions unlike all of the ""tHE neXt BiG sQwEEz"" plays you retards have been posting for the last 24 hours.

129,DD,nax536,2021-05-12 21:28:12,$UWMC Ultimate DD - still hot,"This DD is NOT my own, but was removed for troublesome language. I read through the DD and understand why the OP had their post pulled down. That being said, the content is solid and I think its worth repeating. I have edited the below DD to remove the parts that were maybe a little too over-eager.

$UWMC ULTIMATE DD

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC. The massive 5.75% dividend. Their insanely LOW P/E of about 3.9 and their insane income growth. 4,200% increase in net income! üöÄ (No that‚Äôs not a typo)

So why would any one want to buy this stock right now ?

The CEO is a beast. And not only did they reaffirm their dividend (ex date in June) and just make $860M in the first quarter, they announced the approval of a $300M stock buy back. That‚Äôs big money ! But let‚Äôs dive deeper. The $300M share buy back is of the class A shares that are in the float. $UWMC has a very small float.

104M shares. $300M / $6.70 = 45M. That means at current prices they can buy back nearly 44% of the entire F\*\*kin float. You have never heard of that before and you probably never will again. On earnings call yesterday CEO says ‚ÄúWe can start buying shares tomorrow and I am a buyer at this price !‚Äù

So that leaves 60M shares left in the float. Institutions own 23M of them (I bet it‚Äôs higher) short interest is close to 13M based on latest data.

This just caused the borrow rate to increase by 5X ! new data shows short borrow rates just hit 25%

Apes, there are less than 35M shares freely traded in this stock right now.

On top of all this we still have Russell Inclusion to be announced in June and another blow out 2Q is in the works.

This is NOT financial advice but I can't think of a reason I shouldn‚Äôt park a few dollars in a highly profitable stock, trading at all time lows, paying a 6% dividend with a current p/e under 4?

My position 7900 shares @ 7.64 and 45x 6/18 8c

TL,DR üèò=üíµüíµüíµüíµ = UWMC üöÄüöÄüöÄü§ë  


Edit: since I posted there are only 2,000 shares to loan and the borrow rate is 35%!!?!??

For comparison, $GME is estimated as 24% 

And $AMC is 21%

Now, we all know these are not 100% known quantities as some things are happening behind closed doors (good job, SEC), but it's interesting to see that the more $BB has gone up, the more it is being shorted (scroll down to see it increasing every day on Fintel).

And what was silly at first has now become a real possibility for a $BB short squeeze happening. I believe it has gone from 9% to 24% since this push started.

This also helps explain how the movements of these stocks are so lockstep recently, especially $BB and $AMC. The hedge funds are acting on them in a similar fashion.

$GME's daily movement is similar but slightly different, likely as such a higher entry cost now.

Anyway, I thought this was pretty interesting to see via Fintel.",Discussion,0.72

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/0l28v9tzna471.png?width=1913&format=png&auto=webp&s=31ba3f9fe9554ce6010aaa36cc8616f11ef10ff4)

Dear retards,

Today  I was doing my DD‚Äôs and while doing my wacc, roe and other bullshit  analysis I had the smart idea to have a look at the Short Interest of  sndl.

While looking at it I was  astonished by the data reported by Bloomberg terminal. Our  short-interest ratio is 1.44, while amc is only 0.53 and gme 1.45  (source: Bloomberg terminal).

This means that the number of shorted shares is 1.44 times higher than the average trading volume which is absolutely crazy!!!!

The  percentage of the float is around 15%, however, the data of float  percentage has not been updated yet. IMO we could easily be at around  20, as gme and amc.

The main thing differentiating us from AMC and GME is the SI Score provided by Bloomberg terminal √† 2nd

amc is just 5th whereas gme 4th

To conclude the S3 rate temperature, indicating the seasoned financing levels with 1, 50 or 100

1= Liquid borrows typically indicating a short interest at or below historic terms

50= Marginally higher borrow levels typically indicating somewhat elevated short interest

100= Increased borrow levels typically indicating elevated short interest.

We  are currently at 50, ( gme stands at 1 (source Bloomberg terminal)) and  even in this case, the data have not yet been updated from the previous  month‚Ä¶.

The SQUEEZE is near we all need to hold sundial !!!!

Cheers and have a good day y‚Äôall degenerates

P.S. This is not a financial advice, I‚Äôm just posting for fun and for educational purpose. Have a good day and make DD‚Äôs :)

Alright smooth brains. You might've seen this weird little ticker called CLNE picking up some steam around here and wondered why. Back in March/April there was a very solid DD done about why this company is poised to grow. Will post link in comments 

However there's been a couple of things that have happened since then that turned this from a solid play into a potential gamma squeeze based off OI that won't send us to the moon...but to Saturn!!! ü™ê ü™ê ü™ê

Amazon (yes that Amazon), made a deal with CLNE to fuel their trucks....and the best part? THEY ALSO AGREED TO HAVE THE OPTION TO BUY 50 MILLION SHARES (about 5%) AT $13.49 PER SHARE. EDIT: As /u/dazedstate pointed out I completely forgot to add that they ingeniously built their fuel stations next to Amazon warehouses. 

The stock has low daily trading volume. This allowed certain institutions to hammer it down and keep it there (You know which ones they are). But it's also very easy to push around. How easy? Nrdrage was able to send the price up $1 by himself for under 250K as a demonstration.

The Median PT is $20!!!! that's literally double what it is right now!


SO WHAT ABOUT THE GAMMA SQUEEZE?

Based off that DD the OI for June 16C's @13 has reached 25.22K!! This stock has low volume so 2.5 Million shares reaching ITM would send it shooting up even further. Okay but the average volume is 6M...how does 2.5 million in the money drive it up? Because there would be so much demand at one strike price that there wouldn't be enough stock available at that price which would result in HF's and IB's having to do sweep orders to make up for all the calls they sold.....for those of you with more than one wrinkle... that means the price would keep going up and up until they had enough shares to cover their calls!! And once it hit's that level there's so much momentum it'll keep sky rocketing!!

Here's a chart for those of you who like crayons. (In comments)

Bull sign or just measure of precaution?","So, while my wife and her boyfriend kicked me out this morning to play WWE in the living room, I bought calls on BB. Stonk went up. First time I‚Äôve seen a *real* green day since March. While watching through the window, I switched back and forth between spanking the shit out of my little ape to my wife‚Äôs wrestle mania moves and my portfolio. 

As I lay in the front yard, covered in my own banana sauce, neighbors walked by with their dog, sneering that I had been subjected to ‚Äúwindow duty‚Äù again. Immediately, I stood up, still covered head to toe in my banana sauce like I was attacked by some kind of spooky ghost. I walked right over to them, and proceeded to 360 no-scope cock slap them. Don‚Äôt worry, I hit the collat. 

As they lay on the ground in writhing agony with my cock perfectly imprinted on their faces, I had a sudden thought. Today was a good day. With BlackBerry up so much and the last strike for Friday being 20, BlackBerry has a chance to gamma squeeze. I went back into the house, glowing with a sense of accomplishment. I went to check the options chain to see how the rest of the BB calls did to see that MMs added strikes for this Friday, two days before expiration. So, gamma squeeze unlikely, but still.

Is this a bull sign? Or am I just a smooth brained retard doomed to bathe in his own banana sauce until the end of time? I‚Äôm wondering if this is just standard practice for MMs or they‚Äôre actually worried about how the price action is gonna go tomorrow.

168,UWMC,nityz2,2021-05-23 00:39:52,UWMC ex DIV 6/9??? A Match Made in Heaven,"UWMC has gone up 25% in a week and its still undervalued and over shorted based purely on my autistic beliefs.

EX dividend is literally 6/9 do you need to know anything else? This was made for WSB.

EDIT: I guess I have to do some real DD so automod doesn't ban me. Nobody reads that shit anyways.

Reasons this fucker is going to the moon:

1. They are the top mortgage lender... If you listened to their earnings call it was much different than RKT's. While RKT saw margins damper and guided down for the future, UWMC actually had a completely different tone. Margins were practically unaffected and they probably couldn't have given better guidance. TLDR: Rates go up we dominate competition and market share. Rates stay at these levels we continue to have massive revenues and return that money to the shareholders.
2. Next reason, they actually return money to shareholders! First year on the market and they already pay a dividend and have a massive share repurchase program in the works.
3. Now onto that share buyback program. They announced $300m of share repurchases.... for context when they announced that the entire float was worth $600m... you can see how this might affect price.
4. This company is making nearly 900m a quarter of NET INCOME and is priced at $12b... Show me where else you can find this in this market.
5. As you've already heard a million times by others Wall St is shorting the shit out of this thing for no apparent reason and you best believe they are doubling down after that run up and the recent fed comments on decreased house sales.

TLDR. UWMC going to the moon.... Way over shorted way under priced worst case scenario you are holding something that pays you every quarter and has a track record that lasts decades.

POSITIONS: ROLLED 7.50 calls to 6/18. have about 5 8/20 $6 calls and a shit ton of shares that are paying me every quarter

EDIT: Retards dividends aren't just important for that 10 cents. Stocks like to pump into ex dividend as boomers get interested and pay 50 cents more for a 10 cent dividend. Also I've heard talks of some guy named Russel being interested in the stock, does anyone know if he has a reddit?",Discussion,0.85
169,WKHS,nvy3hb,2021-06-09 17:06:17,$WKHS SI IS NUTS!,"So yesterday I was doing some research and found out that $WKHS has the highest short interest at 41.93% of its float (courtesy of MarketWatch data). This number is now 44.47% (courtesy of ORTEX), this puts it just one place behind CLOV which passed it yesterday. While I'm still not 100% certain on the longevity of the company yet until I see more progress, short term I think this thing has plenty of room to run in the current market. Also, this bad boy has seen numbers like $40+ and I'm confident if momentum picks back up this thing can get back up to the $20+ range.

Currently I own June 18th $17.5 calls in anticipation for this thing to blow the hell up. All this thing needs is more exposure and it will literally go through the roof. There is information going around the $WKHS owns 10% of $RIDE and that $WKHS should go down with it as well. Initially, I thought the same thing until I did a little more research and found out that $WKHS owns part of $RIDE through a licensing deal where $RIDE paid $WKHS $12 million dollars in exchange for intellectual property and 10% stake in their company. This isn't something that $WKHS paid cash for, its basically free stake in that company.

Michael Burry, the infamous investor who profited massively off the 2008 housing bubble is predicting, like many others, a collapse of the bond market. (Source: Scion Asset Management 13F) [He was even payed a visit by the SEC due to this warning](https://www.businessinsider.in/stock-market/news/big-short-investor-michael-burry-says-hell-stop-tweeting-after-sec-regulators-paid-him-a-visit/articleshow/81569128.cms), prompting him to delete his twitter account.

The FED only has two options at the moment:

Raise rates to curb current inflation. This would cause the treasury to raise its coupon rates (bond interest), which would mean lower bond prices. This means the government has to pay higher interest, ultimately leaving the treasury no other option than defaulting on its obligations.

2. The FED doesnt raise rates, and lets inflation (and later hyperinflation) eat away at the dollar. This would also make the bonds worth less, as theyd have to lower the price to compensate for the interest being worth nothing. In this situation, the fed would be the only one willing to hold government bonds which would worsen the inflation as they effectively dont get payed interest on it.

Option one, the government goes bankrupt due to interests being to high to pay back. Option two, the public goes bankrupt due to hyperinflation.

Either way, a short position would profit in this trade.

183,OG,nr3jmz,2021-06-03 05:13:40,Rite Aid ( $RAD ) : One of the Next Meme Stocks to Soar is a Former WallStreetBets OG Favorite,"As meme stocks continue to melt up higher, an old meme favorite from the past is ready to join in on the fun --- That stock is Rite Aid ( RAD ).

**Some Basic Information**

* Rite Aid has only 55 million shares outstanding. Of those, approximately 57.75% are held by institutions and insiders.
* There are 7,860,000 million shares short or about 14.3% of the total outstanding shares. Those familiar with RAD know that it has been a target of short sellers for years who have tried desperately (but failed) to push the company into bankruptcy.
* The company had annual revenue of $24 Billion last year and is projected to hit $25 Billion this year.
* Despite having $24 - $25 Billion in annual revenue, Rite Aid's market cap is barely above $1 Billion.
* The stock price broke above $20 per share on June 2, 2021. The 2021 high share price thus far is $32.48, achieved back in January.
* The company is expected to turn the corner this year and report positive net earnings for the full fiscal year.
* The long-term debt is approximately $3.1 Billion
* Rite Aid achieved positive free cash flow last year and will do so again this year.
* Earlier this year, RAD completed an acquisition of Bartell Drugs for just under $100 Million, making Rite Aid the #1 pharmacy in Seattle.
* Rite Aid is the #3 retail pharmacy in the USA behind CVS and Walgreens.
* In 2018, Walgreens acquired 1,923 Rite Aid stores for $4.4 billion in cash. Rite Aid now has more than 2,500 retail stores today.
* Some analysis done on Rite Aid has projected that the breakup value of the company is in the range of $39 - $50 per share. (example - [https://www.reddit.com/r/RiteAidInvestor\_RAD/comments/m7haju/rite\_aid\_no\_matter\_how\_you\_cut\_it\_it\_is\_the\_right/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RiteAidInvestor_RAD/comments/m7haju/rite_aid_no_matter_how_you_cut_it_it_is_the_right/) )

**Impact of Coronavirus Vaccination Program and Future Contribution of Other Vaccines**

One significant contributor to Rite Aid‚Äôs financial improvement on the current fiscal year results will be the coronavirus vaccine distribution program. Rite Aid is an official participant in the US government‚Äôs Federal Retail Pharmacy Program for COVID-19 Vaccination. The US government dramatically increased the reimbursement rates for pharmacies administering the coronavirus vaccine to $40 from $28 for a single dose.

At the rate of vaccination projected, it is fair to estimate that Rite Aid will administer approximately six (6) million doses of COVID-19 vaccine during the first half of its 2022 fiscal year alone. Using the government reimbursement rates, the six (6) million doses will likely generate $230 million in revenue for Rite Aid and contribute approximately $2 per share in net profits. While the initial vaccination program will likely be completed during Rite Aid‚Äôs fiscal first half, the COVID-19 vaccine boosters are likely to become an annual revenue / profit stream for Rite Aid, as the annual flu vaccine is today. The latest view from epidemiologists suggests that annual coronavirus booster shots will likely be required on an annual basis. The global spread of coronavirus variants such as the E484K mutation lend credence to this view. Furthermore, customers visiting their local Rite Aid for COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters will become aware and take advantage of the fact that the retailer also offers nineteen (19) other vaccines, including flu, pneumonia, chicken pox, HPV, hepatitis A & B, and meningitis among others. As a result, vaccine distribution will continue to play a role in Rite Aids retail pharmacy growth story.

Finally, with the rapid development of mRNA vaccine technology to address the COVID-19 pandemic, we can expect to see new vaccines hit the market to prevent a variety of different types of cancers and other life-threatenting / chronic diseases. Such vaccines would be added to the list administered by pharmacists at local retail stores such as Rite Aid, increasing the revenue and profit potential of such establishments.

**Potential for RAD to Be Acquired**

While Amazon is often mentioned as a suitor for Rite Aid, I actually believe that the highest probability of a buyout of Rite Aid would come from Walmart.

Walmart is already a leading player in the retail pharmacy / prescription drug segment, and the category is a strategic growth target for the company. However, Walmart has nowhere near the presence in the pharmacy sector of either CVS or Walgreens. In order for Walmart to become competitive in this space, they have to increase their size and scale. If Walmart let's Amazon step up and become the third largest player in retail pharmacy, it's game over. WMT needs to move into this third position and block AMZN from doing so.

A couple of the benefits of Walmart acquiring Rite Aid would be:

* Walmart would have double the purchasing power for prescriptions thereby lowering its overall drug cost, improving profitability
* All the goods sold in the front-end of the 2,500+ Rite Aid retail pharmacies are the same products Walmart sells in its own department stores. Once again, when you buy larger quantities you get lower prices. This is a fact of the business world that I know first hand.

Based on the above 2 points, Walmart would improve both its own existing margins and at the same time would improve those of the Rite Aid revenue through such an acquisition.

The Rite Aid PBM would help Walmart to capture much greater market share in the prescription market, thereby enhaning those gains even further.

If you look at Walgreens and CVS when they had approximately $25 - $30 billion in revenue, they were earning about $4 - 6 billion per year. Therefore, considering Walmarts expertise in running brick and mortar establishments, one could make the leap of logic that WMT would achieve similar profit levels. So an acquisition of RAD by Walmart essentially provides a 2-3 year payback on the investment.

**Conclusion - Potential for Share Price to Soar Higher this Summer**

Rite Aid is due to report its Q1 earnings for the current fiscal year on June 24, 2021. The stock is likely to rally back to its 2021 high of $32.48 as that date approaches.

Also, as meme stocks continue to soar higher, Rite Aid is likely to benefit from such market activity as well. With only 55 million shares outstanding, RAD could easily see an exponential run higher should retail investors once again take an interest in this former WSB favorite.

The reason why there will be a lot of money made against short sellers this year is due to what the actual outcome of this battle means.  The battle is who gets to control the narrative in the market.  That's far more valuable than the actual fundamentals in any of these investments.  The value of both these stocks now balances on the fact they are ""battleground stocks.""

AMC and GME were slated to be windfalls for short sellers and predatory investors.  Major Hedge Funds keep taking stupid losses on these stocks because they need to be right.  If they aren't right then the narrative is broken.  So they can't continue a cycle of targeting stocks they want to crash and profiting off the panic they generate.  If retail dictates the narrative then being able to short sell a stock down to nothing becomes a lot harder.  Analysts actually have to study companies intensively and follow market sentiment rather than justifying their sentiment and engineering the falling share price.

So yeah I would hold forever.  Because maybe you FOMO this time around and end up holding the bag.  But we have seen several spikes this year, so next go around you find yourself profiting.  We have seen multiple billion dollar losses reported by hedge funds.  It's easy to suggest that these funds are coming back in to closely watched stocks, trying to short and getting caught.  So we see squeezes and general excitement over serious money being on the wrong side of these stocks.

So not a financial adviser, just a retard.  But yeah I'd hang in, buy during dips and hold until you're happy to profit.  We are going to see AMC and GME fought over all year because the precious narrative is at stake.",Discussion,0.85

* **2021 Q1 ER Beat**

On May the 6th, 2021 BCRX presented Q1 Earnings Report data which managed  ***Beat Analysts estimates***. Basically what matters from this ***Q1 ER*** is that it was the ***launch of Orladeyo***, and Analysts wanted to see a decent amount of money generated by it. They were expecting Orladeyo sales to top ***$3.1MM*** and Orladeyo actually generated ***$10.94MM***, this is a ***353% sales beat***

https://preview.redd.it/uppmf8dy09z61.png?width=765&format=png&auto=webp&s=7215a9fc3d12ae2ead2bb782802742ef8ab998cb

The consequence of the ER beat was an increase of **24.06%** in the **SP**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It's *really important* to mention that **revenues generated this Q1** only came from the **USA**.

This **Q2 Orladeyo** has been **approved in Japan/Europe/UK** aswell, adding new sources of revenue.

&#x200B;

**Orladeyo sales** are expected to **grow exponentially** **each quarter**. Main reason for it is that it has been approved in the countries mentioned above. The other reason is that the amount of **patients** they treat will **slowly score up** as **insurance companies allow** their clients to be treated with this drug.

&#x200B;

The data displayed below shows the amount of patients using Orladeyo in 3 or 4 pharmacies which provide information to Bloomberg. This numbers help us track how Orladeyo's sales evolve, but it's not 100% accurate.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qw97n7ga89z61.png?width=1257&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d353dc8fe919da2f4e10d6c5f68527c7cb7813b

If we sum up the numbers from Q1 we get a total of 43 patients, in the first month of Q2 there are 38 new patients already. Meaning Orladeyo nearly managed to get in a single month all the amount of patients it gathered in Q1, **reasuring the exponential growth.** This numbers will keep rising now that Orladeyo is approved in more countries.

&#x200B;

Orladeyo is the ***first Oral approved*** treatment used to prevent swelling attacks in people with ***hereditary angioedema (HAE)*****,** disease which is estimated to affect ***1 in 50,000 people.***

&#x200B;

\- Orladeyo was firstly approved in the ***USA*** ***December the 3rd,*** ***2020. Q4***

\- Orladeyo received ***Japan*** NHI price listing approval ***April the 14th, 2021. Q2***

\- Orladeyo received ***Europe*** approval ***April the 30th, 2021 Q2***

\- Orladeyo received ***UK*** approval ***May the 12th, 2021 Q2***

***Orladeyo*** is [ranked](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/pharmacy/20-most-expensive-prescription-drugs-in-2021.html) the ***#13 most expensive drug*** ***in the USA*** market. ***$37,308*** is approximately what patients ( insurances ) must monthly pay to access the drug.

The fact ***Orladeyo*** is ***taken*** ***orally it's huge.*** Back then before ***Oral Orladeyo*** was approved for HAE, ***patients*** would only have treatments that required usage of ***needles,*** there were ***no other oral treatments approved to treat HAE***.

As it's shown in[ the January 2021 Corporate Presentation](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 16), Physicians expect to Prescribe ***Orladeyo for over 40% of HAE Patients.***

**USA**

In the USA there currently are 10,000 patients, ***7500 diagnosed and treated,*** 1700 diagnosed but not treated, 600 treated but not diagnosed.

Physicians expect to prescribe ***Orladeyo for over 41% of HAE patients***. Conservatively thinking, taking 7,500 patients ( the diagnosed and treated ones ) out of the total 10,000 pool in the USA, with over[ 41% of patients prescription](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) ( page 16 ) we would conservatively aim for ***3,075 patients.***

The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in the USA, is equal to ***485,000$***

&#x200B;

**Japan**

On November the 5th Biocryst undergone an agreement with ***Torii Pharmaceuticals.*** A local Japanese company that will be in charge of getting new patients to be treated with Orladeyo in Japan and commerzialing it.

Japan has around 2,500 HAE patients, and Biocryst conservatively expects to ***at*** ***least reach 500 patients.***

The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in Japan, is equal to ***$248,500***

***Approval of Orladeyo in Japan issued a $15MM milestone payment*** from Torii.

***BioCryst will receive*** tiered royalties ranging from ***20% - 40% of Japanese sales.***

&#x200B;

**Europe**

It's estimated to be around ***12,000 HAE patients in Europe.*** Following the physician prescription of over[ 41% of patients to prescribe](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 16) for Orladeyo. We get a total of ***4,920 patients*** in Europe.

Since pricings and jurisdictions work in a different way in Europe, the amount of money each patient will have to pay for Orladeyo is expected to be around or above Japan's ***$248,500/year.*** This number should soon be confirmed.

&#x200B;

**United Kingdom**

It's estimated there are **1500-2000 HAE** patients in there, **1000 of them diagnosed**. Following the physician prescription of over[ 41% of patients to prescribe](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 16) for Orladeyo we should expect to capture 400 patients.

Orladeyo price in UK is expected to be similar to the one in Japan \~ ***$248,500/year***. meaning **$99,400,000** revenue with 400 patients.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

With this yearly prices and the amount of patients defined before, we get the following results.

\- ***USA - 3,075p x 485K = 1,491,375,000$***

\- ***Japan - 500p x 248,5K = 124,250,000$***

\- ***EU - 4,920p x 248,5K = 1,222,620,000$***

**- UK - 400p x 248,5K = 99,400,000$**

Summing it all up we get $2,850,670,000. From that number we have to subtract 123,100,000$ making it a total of ***$2,727,570,000***. The sustraction happens as a result of the undergone Royalty agreement with Torii Pharmaceuticals and Royalty Pharma.

&#x200B;

Having in mind the discussed numbers before, Orladeyo alone will be generating ***$2,727,570,000*** a year, using the average mid-cap Biotech company multiplier **x7**. We get a total of ***$19,092,990,000*** meaning an increase of ***$104,46*** in the stock price. 108.41

* **Conclusion**

We are just about to witness how ***BCRX evolves*** from being an R&D company, to be a commercial stage one. This will mainly happen due to the ***revenue generated by Orladeyo*** and the ***potential of BCX9930.***

Basically from now on ***each ER will be a new catalyst for BCRX.*** Considering how Orladeyo is still in an early launch state the revenue it generates will exponentially keep growing, so will the SP.

***Orladeyo*** undoubtly is an awesome asset for BCRX, a ***cash-cow***. But the one drug in BCRX's pipeline that has the ***most promising future is BCX9930***. An Oral inhibitor in PH3 pivotal studies which treats ***8 different diseases*** as of now, aimming for a potential ***40B market size by 2025***. Deeper information about it can be found in the following article [BCRX - The Embarrassment of Riches](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mtzhp2/bcrx_dd_the_embarrassment_of_riches/).

I currently do have a position in this company, my average entry price being around the 4$ range. In my opinion BCRX probably has the **best risk/reward ratio in the bio-world** and I do not plan to sell my shares yet.",DD,0.81

2. Long holders will not sell, the stock is issuing a 4%+ dividend on July 6th and most of that will probably be auto-reinvested into the stock.  The company has Triple digit YOY growth and q1 2021 was the best ever.
3. There is a 22% short interest on float.  This is extremely high on a profitable company.
4.  The real reason this will squeeze is because the cost to borrow is a staggering 38%. Together with the love from long holders, the $300m share buyback program and high interest on every single stock message board, this is looking to be the absolutely best squeeze possibility.

After Friday's action, the conclusion is no, but let's look at the chart and see what's going on.

What happened on Friday:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x2wmukqxbp371.png?width=1916&format=png&auto=webp&s=01459ffc0e98d47ef446f563fcf853f0fff36af1

The first real red day in 2 weeks lost support at the $14.50 USD mark but also had reduced volume. Can't win them all. We should consider this pullback extremely healthy and does not interfere with the overall bull trend as we were exceeding the Bollinger bands for 5 straight trading days. Exceeding the Bollinger bands is considered to be a strong indicator of volatility, and I strongly believe we have more volatility to come. I would also assume traders were taking their anywhere from 60%-100% profits off the table.

We did not bounce back up to the $24-$33 range as I expected on Friday, but again opinions are like assholes. Everyone has one. I believe that range is easily accessible still through this coming trading week.

Signs that make me bearish:  
\-1D chart RSI is still quite high but is reaching back into a healthy range.  
\-Lower volume Friday. But the overall market was low and red so I'm not too concerned.  
\-Gap to be filled on the chart. \~$11.56-12.30. Usually, gaps do get filled on charts but not always in the short term.  
\-Loss of the 14.50 support. On the hourly chart we had a small bounce in that range on Thursday after the massive opening and slightly recovered, a bounce again just after open on Friday but ultimately failed for the rest of the day. This is a volume issue and many taking profits/losses trying to swing trade.  
\-Possibility of reaching $12.10, if that fails next stop is probably \~$11.30

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nvjhe4fybp371.png?width=1811&format=png&auto=webp&s=817de62d8aedc2eacb1a9bcbbb5e3ac73bf1a80e

These are the bearish signals that I can find and are important to note but again the overall bull trend still exists on a daily, and when in doubt zoom out is the motto. One bad day does not mean you have a bad life.

Signs that make me bullish:  
\-We ended the day inside the top end of the Bollinger bands and they appear to not be contracting yet on the daily chart.  
\-20 DMA and 50DMA have just crossed. This is called a golden cross and the 200DMA is now beginning to slope upwards.  
\-Large amount of strength in the $13.00 range. If you look back at the hourly chart above where we ended Friday you can see where it is flat in comparison to on Wednesday. This shows strong support in this range and will be a powerful foundation to build a cup and handle formation. This range was also significant in the previous run in January

&#x200B;

\-Still a large following and people interested in $BB this weekend across forums, subreddits, and media. #1 ticker on WSB Thursday and Friday.  
\-Largest open interest of stock options is $20 USD.  
\-Put/call ratio still relatively low  
\-Small short shares available (Squeeze is in the realm of possibilities again)  
\-RSI looks healthy on the hourly for a dead cat bounce at open  
\-Currently, one of the best plays technically speaking but also fundamentally for the long term (1-2 years+).  
\-I have confirmation bias because cybersecurity is a massive growth market. If you didn't hear, JBS is the world's largest supplier of beef, and got hacked might actually cause a shortage of beef in the supermarkets or a large squeeze in beef prices. Go long on beef and cybersecurity.  
\-Institutions are still accumulating. Remember, around 48% of BB is owned by institutions and insiders. This is massive. One of the largest companies with large institutional ownership is Microsoft at \~70% or Facebook with an %80. We aren't that far off with a much much lower share count.

If the share price goes down significantly tomorrow I'll post another update, only because if the share price goes down with such a small amount of short shares available I believe this will only be tightening the slingshot further that would rocket $BB's share price to the $30s.

Things that we need to continue to look for:  
\-High volume  
\-Amount of posts and articles about $BB on Reddit, commercial websites, and other forums  
\-News or statements from $BB. One piece of news that's significant could be the catalyst to a moonshot.

This week's price target remains the same as what I wanted on Friday. Anywhere $24-$33USD.

208,A,nfqs26,2021-05-19 02:21:28,Discovering the True Rate of Inflation: A DD on the Fed,"*Would have posted on* r/investing*,  but they don't allow graphs. Read at your own risk.*

So I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**

1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.
2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  

[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

[A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/u1p8k5w2vyz61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313b90056ba27d95c63cbff50b7e0142d84b327)

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

212,A,npzfzx,2021-06-01 19:28:09,A reminder that CEOs are not WSB'ers,"On April 15, 2021 the CEO of AMC pledged:

"" We are going to pledge right now today publicly and we will file this publicly so it will be binding on us, because you can‚Äôt announce intentions and then not carry through it, **we hereby pledge at AMC that if the shareholders approve this authorization for 500 million new shares to be issued we will not use one of those 500 million shares in calendar year 2021. Not one. Not one**. ""

Today, only 45 days, (45 days later!):

"" AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC) (‚ÄúAMC‚Äù or ‚Äúthe Company‚Äù), announced today that it has entered into an agreement to raise $230.5 million of cash from the sale of equity to Mudrick Capital Management, L.P. in exchange for 8.5 million shares of AMC‚Äôs Class A Common stock. ""

&#x200B;

Now, certainly, in a technical sense, AMC could argue that these new shares that were issued were actually authorized in 2013, but that is just in a way a bit of legal wrangling. The fact is that when the CEO was boasting about not selling new shares, they were likely at the exact same time in talks with Mudrick Capital to sell shares (230M deals don't just happen overnight).

&#x200B;

Now, it may be good for AMC to get some cash, but we shouldn't overlook the duplicity here. Mudrick is a hedge fund, and if you think for a second they are going to have diamond hands, I would look yourself in a mirror. As soon as the squeeze is pushing shorts, Mudrick will be right there to help them close all their positions.

Edit: As several users have pointed out, it appears Mudrick has already sold their entire stake. This is BAD for a squeeze, as it means all the shares are trading on the market.

214,CLOV,nv3xfz,2021-06-08 15:23:38,$CLOV - Will the Real Meme Please Stand Up?,"Given all the hype lately around meme-ageddon and the explosion in price movement, volume, and sentiment around everyone's favorite ""meme"" stocks lately, I thought I'd do a simple (really, really simple) comparative analysis based on 6 month charts of some of go-to tickers.

**My purpose in doing so?** To see if we can establish a trend and differentiate these stocks in any meaningful way.

**Why do I think this is important?** The ""squeeze"" narrative has been used a lot since Jan following the parabolic movements of several stocks. Since then, I feel that all ""squeeze"" and ""meme"" stocks have been psychologically grouped as the same, but their trends show they are not.

**The simple hypothesis?** We should be able to easily differentiate the Jan stocks as compared to any of the others that gained attention post-January.

There was a defined and unique occurrence that took place back in Jan surrounding $GME, $AMC, $BB, $KOSS, $NOK, $BBBY, and Express. Since then, we have seen a wave of ""short squeeze"" narratives for other tickers, but the difference around the January stocks was how they appeared to all move in tandem and have a relatively strong correlation, setting them apart, and potential pointing to some broader scheme involved utilizing naked shorting and resulting in massive FTDs.

It goes to say this is an anomaly and I believe these stocks should be looked at differently when compared with other ""squeeze"" and ""meme"" stocks being pushed.

**Side Note:** For these charts, all tickers will be set to full screen scaling on Trading View in order to see how closely their trends in price action move together, so it's not comparative of current price per share but of their general movements, when those movements took place, and individual gains.

Some of the ""squeeze"" stocks that followed January's events, $CLOV, $RKT, and $MVIS, compared with $GME over a 6 month basis. $GME because it was the most notable Jan stock historically until recently.

&#x200B;

[It may not be as apparent from this first picture, but there is divergence in these stocks trends. I would argue the second half of the chart appears more correlated because everything became sentimentally grouped together as \\""meme\\"" stocks after the MSM started pumping WSB narratives for everything.](https://preview.redd.it/3jgm7j8rl1471.png?width=3335&format=png&auto=webp&s=457655244d8a809517d4a68c9ce168804f2d2f41)

It may not be as apparent from this first picture, but there is divergence in these stocks trends. I would argue the second half of the chart appears more correlated because everything became sentimentally grouped together as ""meme"" stocks after the MSM started pumping WSB narratives for everything.

**What can I infer from this, just from looking at it?**

$CLOV has done its own thing until closer to late March when it first started getting attention (again) after the massive influx of WSB participants post-Jan. Even so, if you look close enough, it has peaks and valleys that move against the trend of $GME.

$MVIS also definitely follows its own tune.

$RKT is actually the one of these 3 that looks like it could follow $GME, but it didn't ""squeeze"" in Jan with the others. It had a massive run up in the beginning of March that sticks out against the others.

It appears to me that it was really around March that this psychological collective was starting to be established as we see a little less divergence in trends, though they are still identifiable as different.

Now compare $GME and $AMC. Although $AMC didn't run up in March, if you study these lines, you can see there consistent moves up and down at the same time as $GME until recently May.

January peak when they triple fucked us says it all.

This may be a shoddy effort to show the differences I'm trying to highlight, but I think if anyone were to take the time to play around with some charts and overlay the tickers, you can see just from basic visual analysis that there is extreme similarity in all of the Jan stocks over 6 months, suggesting they are in their own bucket entirely independent of other ""meme"" stocks.

If we take the time to compare Jan stocks 1 on 1 with others, it highlights this difference.

I'll use Express here because no one talks about it but it has Jan stock correlation. This tells me that it isn't sentiment driven and is seemingly moving with other Jan stocks for another reason that isn't ""retail"" pumping it.

**Why did I bother to go through all of this?**

I think it's important to provide some distinction between the events of Jan and those respective stocks as compared to the more recent favorites. I'm not saying what will or will not ""squeeze,"" but I do think it's important to separate the narratives around ""meme"" stocks when evaluating risk and trying to understand what influences a particular stock.

If this wasn't so long already and if I had the character limit, I'd give my interpretation of the time line, when and why certain narratives formed, and how it's important, but I think the charts says enough.",Discussion,0.71

I'm getting deja vu. 

This stock has hit its tipping point today in my opinion by breaking through the 21 dollar wall. It appears that the shorts covered then reapplied at 21.20 which we just broke through again. This was exactly what was happening from what I can tell last time she gamma squeezed. 

Now with multiple stocks skyrocketing all in the same week, the hedge funds holding this down are extremely weak. RKT has been gaining volume the last week. RKT is a powder keg about to go off! The one major difference between this stock and the ""MEMES"" Is that ROCKET makes money, a shit ton of money.  

Now I understand that we dont have the dividend news we had last time. I get that. But I think with the continuing pressure we still see another massive spike in RKTS future!

The assumption being made here is that the stock market will react to AMC, BB, and ASO short squeezes EXACTLY as it did to GME. A true apples to apples comparison of what has happened to GME being applied to our other favorites.

Up first is teaching you how to calculate earning in the form of a percentage. The formula goes like this. (Current Value - initial Cost)√∑initial cost x 100= percentage return. 

GmE started at roughly 18$ before it gained squeeze worthy traction and eventually topped out at $483. I chose 18$ as the starting point t because earning up until that point were smooth and slowly trending upwards on a 1 year chart. GmE has 70 Million Shares outstanding. It's 18 to 483 dollars increase gives it a return of 2,583% roughly.

Applying this to AMC goes like this. AMC had a ""pre-surge"" stable price of 10$. 10x25.83=258$ however GME only has 15 percent of the shares outstanding that AMC has so you have to consider the market Cap. $258x.15%= $38.70 expected squeeze price. All variables being the same at its highest AMC could go to $38.70 

BB is going  to be very similar to AMC because of a large market cap. BB ""pre-surge"" stable price is $10 as well, this is being generous because a good argument could be made to use $8-9 but I decided to use 10. So 10x25.83=$258 however GME only has 12% of shares outstanding as BB so that has to be factored in 258x .12%= $30.96  I believe at the height of any BB squeeze due to market cap the price could soar as high as $30 using GME variables.

Here is where things get interesting ASO has a ""pre-surge"" stable price of $30 and GME has 77% of shares outstanding compared to ASO, a Much higher variable, with a much higher starting price, and a higher short interest than BB & AMC. Here we go 30x25.83= 775$ 
775 x.77= $596 squeeze price potential

So in essence we can triple our money or better on AMC & BB depending on when you bought in. AsO has the potential to be HUUUGGEüöÄüöÄüíØüòÉ",DD,0.78

BB:
60 $30c 01/2022 at $0.27
üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ


Already powering many of the telematics of current cars, BB is poised to benefit from their established relationships with big automakers. Getting certified with an automaker is not easy, so it is a barrier to entry for other companies wanting in on the action. Security and reliability are top of mind for these companies. You don‚Äôt want your car to get hacked easily, so what better than a cybersecurity company that happens to also do EV software, and already has experience with ICE cars. I did a long DD here 4 months ago and still stand by it: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxknrl/bb_dd_9_reasons_why_bb_is_from_former_bb_employee/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf


SONY:
100 shares at $101
üöÄüöÄüöÄ


I wouldn‚Äôt call this the Japanese equivalent for BB, as they aren‚Äôt a cybersecurity company. But Sony has a thriving consumer and B2B business that benefits greatly from consumer demand: the fact that they are literally selling every single PS5 they make is amazing and image sensors going out on many cell phones, including Apple using both image and lidar sensors from Sony. Great solid volume of sales to stabilize the company after some stagnant years.

On PS5, it‚Äôs actually a good thing that there‚Äôs a chip shortage. As Sony loses money on the hardware (and earn on game royalties and licenses), they are buying time to refine their manufacturing to lower costs, and lose less money on hardware sales. And because demand is so hot for the PS5, they are on track to build a bigger platform than even PS4 to charge 20-30% on every game they sell. That‚Äôs some fat margin.

Now, you‚Äôre probably wondering‚Ä¶wtf, I‚Äôm here to read about EVs, why you telling me about PS5s? Yeah, you‚Äôre right but a conglomerate like Sony is multifaceted. While they build up their EV software platform, they have cash cows in imagery and video games. And if Apple is really building an EV, I would bet (am literally betting) that they would rely on currently trusted partners like Sony for their imaging needs. You sit inside an Apple car and camera recognizes who you are and where you‚Äôre sitting? Well that‚Äôs probably a Sony camera‚Ä¶or 20 of them. There will be so many cameras inside and outside of any Apple car. I mean‚Ä¶my iPhone 12 has 4 cameras, and it‚Äôs a tiny slab of glass and my family can‚Äôt sit inside and drive down the road with others in the environment.

And when Japanese automakers get into EVs, they‚Äôll look into a Japanese partnership. Guess who‚Äôs probably in pole position?

Full disclosure, I also have 150 AAPL.



VW:
200 shares @ $33.32
üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

You are all excited about Ford. I am too but I‚Äôm not buying into them because I think they are overhyped. But what‚Äôs interesting about Ford‚Äôs EV play is that they are partnering with VW to do so. That means‚Ä¶even if Ford can‚Äôt sell that many cars, VW will probably still benefit from joint research development and cost sharing. We also know how much more climate change is viewed as reality in Europe, and that‚Äôs VW‚Äôs home territory. VW already launching EVs under Audi, Porsche in the premium sector, VW, Skoda and Seat in the value sector, and Bentley and Lamborghini will likely have their ultra premium EVs soon.

But you might wonder‚Ä¶what about Tesla? They are so great! Well yeah they aren‚Äôt that bad. But VW is a goddamn monster. It‚Äôs kind of cute when Tesla announces a new plant, oh this is my 4th plant! We now have Shanghai and Fremont and building out Berlin and Austin. That‚Äôs cute. VW has 136 plants around the world. The economies of scale is insane and will be able to source materials for incredibly better deals. Oh and there‚Äôs that other partner called Ford who builds millions of cars a year also jumping into to beat on suppliers to give them both better pricing. Welcome to the big leagues, EVs.

VW is likely to launching 5-10 EVs per year, the equivalent the full Tesla line up every year. And they have Electricfy America network (and Canada) and similar in Europe.

And one more thing: VW also does trucks. Like 18 wheeler trucks. They are one of the biggest manufacturers, behind brands such as Man, Scania, and Navistar. And trucks have even more of a compelling business case for EVs‚Ä¶Will merge this part with Volvo.


Volvo:
800 shares @ $26
üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ


Going to keep this briefer because this is already a novel. Now, when I say Volvo, I don‚Äôt mean Volvo Cars. That‚Äôs bought by Geely and yes they are making EVs under Volvo and Polestar brands. But I‚Äôm taking about AB Volvo, still out of Sweden, building trucks, mining equipment, backhoes, haul trucks and cranes.

EVs are so more more compelling because of the use and mileage they get. It‚Äôs not uncommon for a one year old truck to have a million miles. And as cities around the world clamp down on urban center access (congestion or polluter fees common in Europe, and allow EVs in for discount or free), EVs increasingly make more sense. You save so much on lower op/maintenance costs, avoiding tolls and tax credits. Oil prices will be going back up so saving on fuel costs is the smart thing to do.

Another thing is, governments around the world are spending trillions on infrastructure stimulus. What do these trillions buy? Concrete, steel, Volvo construction equipment, labor. Where does the concrete, steel and other commodities (like rising gold and silver prices) come from? They get mined out of the ground with big Caterpillar, Liebherr and Volvo equipment. Yep, there‚Äôs Volvo again!

So if you believe stimulus is happening, Volvo is a good choice. If you believe inflation is real, Volvo is a good choice. If you believe EV is the future for hauling shorter distances and/or heavy loads, Volvo is a good choice.

Ok apes, chimps, gorillas, primates of all stripes... I'm going to level with you. I am posting this mainly because I want to throw one of my best ideas into the ring. But that's not the only reason I am writing this. I also want to inspire those of you who are just getting started in this game. For those who say that retail investors can't consistently make money in markets, I present you with some recent gain porn for your viewing pleasure. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gyvyzp0yln371.png?width=1355&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf56089ae7e9cff017cacdc546e9aa3c9e55f329

Look, I won't lie, making money investing is not easy -- lots of smart people are trying to do the same thing. But the real challenge is having the emotional resilience to stick with your thesis, and while not easy, if you stick to basic math and only invest in what you know, it is simple. 

As retail investors, we have a huge advantage over the big guys on Wall Street who need to hug the benchmarks, satisfy investor demands for quarterly results and invest only where they can expect to generate acceptable ""risk-adjusted"" returns where risk is bizarrely defined as ""volatility"", instead of permanent impairment of capital, which is how I see it. 

We can arbitrage these structural weaknesses in institutional portfolio management by making contrarian bets on stocks that are currently out of favor with the big guys, provided we've done our homework on the business and believe that it is undervalued. Eventually, if we are right about the trajectory of the business, they will eventually be forced to buy us out at a huge premium when the results prove out and herd mentality kicks back in the other way. 

I've made a nice chunk of coin on several positions over the last few years, which has enabled me to make bigger investments, and I am currently up materially on my latest portfolio positions. These are positions I have held for long time periods, with Bed Bath and Beyond being the largest position, the longest held and highest percentage gains. In my view, it also has the most upside, so I want to share a bit more with you about my thesis.

**Nothing I've said or am about to say should be construed in any way as investment advice.** **This is just me sharing my YOLO, with an explanation for my thesis.** 

Bed Bath and Beyond was a successful business when it first arrived on the scene, practically creating and defining the concept of Big Box Retail. As so often happens in life, their huge initial success bred complacency, and the co-founders (Warren Eisenberg and Leonard Feinstein) who continued presiding over the Board basically ran the company like it was their private piggy bank, without regard for small (or even large) shareholders. 

Under the leadership of Steven Temares, the CEO they handpicked, the business failed to innovate and keep up with basic changes taking place in retail -- such as the rise of e-commerce. BBBY began to see online giants like Amazon and even brick & mortar mass merchants like Target and Lowes begin to eat their lunch. Steven Temares, along with the rest of the c-suite, continued to receive huge salaries and bonuses, while the two co-founders received generous perks like personal black-car chauffer services, all paid for by the company -- and therefore, shareholders. 

They also refused to answer basic questions posited by Wall Street research analysts on earnings calls, seeing the investment community essentially as a nuisance to be tolerated but not proxies for the true owners of the business -- public investors. 

Well, the situation got so bad that finally, circa mid-2019 in the year of our chimp lord, a trifecta of activist investors led by Legion Partners (founder was trained by legendary activist Nelson Peltz) and John Duskin at Macellum Capital decided to wage war, buying up \~6% of the stock and filing a 170 white paper detailing all of the problems with how the company was being run and proposing to replace the entire Board of Directors and management team with its own slate of nominees. The presentation, which is phenomenal, is posted here:

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886158/000092189519001180/ex1dfan14a09050028_04262019.pdf

They went so far as to create a website for their campaign, [restorebedbath.com](https://restorebedbath.com/), which they eventually dismantled after reaching a cooperation and settlement agreement with the Board of Directors. This agreement effectively ceded control to the activists, who proceeded to replace everyone. It was a real Red Wedding style bloodbath... I mean total scorched earth policy... no respect for life. While it's never pleasant seeing people get canned, these people deserved it. After years and years of unaccountable shareholder abuse, someone finally came along and pulled out the game cartridge, blew on it and hit ""reset"" on the console. And they saw that it was good. 

In November 2019 they announced Mark Tritton, legendary Chief Merchandising Officer from Target who was the main person responsible for their massive success in developing private label / owned brand programs, would be taking the helm as CEO. Since taking charge, Mark has consistently been executing on the playbook laid out by the activists in their white paper, which basically calls for making low risk / high return changes to bring Bed Bath and Beyond up to modern retailing standards using well established best practices. 

While some would argue that a turnaround of this magnitude carries high execution risk, I would disagree at this time for several reasons: (1) The changes they have been making are actually quite well established strategies for modern retailing, with loads of case studies to pull from (Best Buy, Target, Lowes, etc); (2) they have the best team you could ask for implementing these changes (i.e., Mark Tritton and John Hartmann, who became COO of BBBY after a highly successful run as CEO of True Value hardware chains); (3) their compensation is heavily geared towards stock compensation, so **they only win if we all win;** and (4) most of the highest risk action plans, like divesting of non-core assets, culling unproductive / unprofitable stores, reducing bloated headcount and liquidating stale inventories at reasonable valuations, are all in the rear-view mirror. 

As of June 2021, Bed Bath and Beyond is at an inflection point with a strong focus on driving profitable growth from its core business lines. This comes down to a few very important strategies: (1) focusing on digital first, omni-always capabilities (leading with the website and mobile app but making sure they are able to serve customers however, whenever and wherever they want to shop -- think curbside pick-up, same-day delivery and buy-online pick-up in store aka BOPIS); (2) focusing on key destination categories where the company is seen as an authority in the home, driving preference for BBBY over other chains and even national brands by defining its key categories using data and developing owned brands to fill out their assortment in those areas (they have launched 6 so far this year, with another 4 expected by end of year -- ultimately they expect 30% of their sales to come from the brands they have created). This will help help them in multiple ways. First, the products are only going to be available at BBBY, so they are re-establishing their authority in the home and preference for BBBY as a brand and not just a venue to shop other manufacturers' products (this also means these items can't be bought online except for thru BBBY, so it is Amazon defense playbook 101). Second, these products have been strategically developed in areas where they had gaps in their assortment relative to the competitors they were losing share to. As mentioned above, development of these brands was informed by **data**, including detailed line reviews and purchasing data. Third, and final, these products are designed to cost and have very healthy margins that should improve the overall margin profile of the business as they are rolled out. This fireside chat with Mark Tritton from January 2021 explains it all far better than I can, and is well worth watching for curious apes: 

[https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/videos/a-fireside-chat-with-mark-tritton-president-and-ceo-of-bed-bath-and-beyond/](https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/videos/a-fireside-chat-with-mark-tritton-president-and-ceo-of-bed-bath-and-beyond/)

**So where does this all leave us today?**

The company has successfully implemented its digital first, omni-always capabilities, rolling out BOPIS, curbside pickup and same-day delivery (just signed up deals with Instacart & Doordash). Digital sales were up 86% in the most recent quarter and 99% in the Bed Bath banner (they also own Buy Buy Baby, which is the largest national baby retail chain in the US with the bankruptcy of Babies R US -- this alone makes BBBY an interesting investment with tons of hidden value).

For the first time in **years**, the company began posting positive same-store sales for the last 3 quarters under Mark Tritton (consistently comping up in the mid-single digits). This is a very positive sign of the changes taking place already. Same-store sales metrics are probably the most important data point for retailers, as it basically tells you if consumers think they have a good reason to exist. Quite frankly, it is an extraordinary achievement by Mark and his team that after years of declining same-store sales they are now positive for 3 consecutive quarters, and I don't think this has gotten enough attention.

They have also begun launching their new owned brands, with 6 already launched and another 4 or so on the way this year. These brands have a strong focus on their top 5 destination categories (bedding, bath, kitchen & food prep, indoor decor, and organization) -- I've personally purchased and used these products, and they are excellent quality at reasonable price points. I think they will do great.

They are repurchasing $1bn of their own stock (at least $375mm completed so far at an average price of \~$23 per share, reducing their share count from \~126mm to \~109mm.

Normalizing their revenues for divested brands and culling of unprofitable / lowest productivity stores in their footprint, management has guided to \~$8.2bn of sales and $525mm of EBITDA **this year,** with sales comping up in the low- to mid-single digits range for the next several years and EBITDA margins improving to high single digits / low double digits resulting in EBITDA of $850mm-$1bn by YE 2023.

Applying simple mathematics and established standards of value, I believe the evidence shows that businesses in this industry (big box and specialty retail) would typically be valued at \~8-12x EBITDA which would imply an enterprise value (value of the whole business, not just the equity) of \~$9bn at the midpoint, which seems eminently reasonable for an iconic retailer under solid leadership with about 1000 stores and authority in key growing segments of the US economy.

Since they have virtually the same amount of cash as debt, the enterprise value should be about the same as the equity value, so \~$9bn at the midpoint above. With \~109mm shares outstanding today, that puts implied equity value per share at \~$82, but where it gets even more interesting is if you factor in the share buybacks. They've still got $625mm of remaining authorized share repurchases under their existing program, and depending on how cheap they are able to buy those shares they could materially reduce the share count further.

**So why are the big institutional investors continuing to ignore this stock? Why does everyone continue to ignore the insanely cheap valuation and upside potential under the extraordinary new leadership of Mark Tritton, John Hartmann and the rest of the new team?** 

I can think of several possibilities, but probably the main one is a backward looking bias, because the memory of the old management team and their awful performance dies hard. Their prolonged period of value destruction also gave rise to a narrative, parroted widely by thematic investors and talking heads on CNBC, basically a nonsense theory that all brick & mortar would die and the consumer would only ever want to shop at Amazon (somehow ignoring blatantly contradictory evidence provided by Target, Lowes, Walmart, etc). 

In this excellent interview with burgeoning hedge fund manager Dan McMurtrie (aka Supermugatu), he discusses the reality of how Amazon is killing bad retail, not all retail, and how certain investors / the media have taken the the idea way too far as they so often love to do. **I cannot recommend this highly enough -- well worth watching beginning at 39:45.**

[https://www.realvision.com/unmasking-supermugatu-how-the-pros-find-edge](https://www.realvision.com/unmasking-supermugatu-how-the-pros-find-edge)

It might take some time for BBBY to shake off the worries created during the former management team's tenure. Most of the time, the stock market is forward looking, but in this case investors have adopted a thesis that has them psychologically stuck in the past due to PTSD, and the distractions in rear-view mirror are blinding them to what is likely to happen in the next 6, 12, 18 months. 

Eventually, I personally expect BBBY to shock the market with positive results one of these quarters, forcing a rapid, seemingly unexpected valuation revision in the stock. They have already begun to put up excellent numbers, if you look at the underlying same-store sales, digital growth, growth in top 5 destination categories, for example. However, there has still been a lot of noise in the numbers from divestitures, culling of store footprint, COVID impact in 2020, etc., and it appears that perception has not caught up yet with the new reality.

While I haven't focused on it much here, the company also has an excellent balance sheet with over $1bn of cash, no meaningful near-term debt maturities, solidly positive free cash flow generation & very high short interest.

Even with all of the prevailing negative sentiment, this has been a profitable investment for me so far (I purchased heavily in periods where others abandoned hope over the last few years). In my opinion, the company is probably worth about $80 / share as of today, however with continued solid execution and more enthusiasm coming back into the name, I could see this valued well into the triple digits. 

So, even with my sizeable gains I haven't sold one share and don't plan to anytime soon. I am holding this baby to the end.",DD,0.72

234,TLRY,nn326f,2021-05-28 19:33:28,MORE ACT / CANNABIS / $SNDL &amp; $TLRY Potential,"What up peeps. I want to cover two tickers here, $SNDL which currently meets the sidebar rules with today's move. 1.6B market cap and is trading above $1. I get it mods, you gonna mod but I'll keep writing. The other is the infamous $TLRY.   


The News...

If you haven't read yet it looks like Federal Cannabis legalization my be around the corner. [Here](https://www.mpp.org/policy/federal/the-more-act/) is the House Bill. Supporters seem on board and like the reforms they have done to the bill including rescheduling cannabis. [Last time](https://mjbizdaily.com/key-us-house-lawmaker-reintroduces-federal-marijuana-legalization-bill/) the bill was introduced it cleared the House.   


Personally I think this gets a lot of support especially from a fiscal point of view. With stimulus stalling and a giant debate going on about how to pay for the stimulus I think cannabis offers the easiest way to collect federal revenue. A simple review of the bill and the fiscal benefits to the Fed's can be read [here](https://www.justtherealnews.com/congress/nadler-blumenauer-lee-jackson-lee-jeffries-velazquez-reintroduce-comprehensive-marijuana-reform-legislation/). The bill states a 5% fed tax. Money coming for uncle Sam, right when questions about paying for stimulus.... Personally I think it adds up, but that's for you to decide. 

Okay so that's the hype...

Let's talk about the tickers listed ($SNDL and $TLRY). 

$SNDL

I'll start with the cheaper YOLO, $SNDL. $SNDL short interest isn't high, but the company did issue convertible notes a while back around .7c if my memory is correct. I'm not saying they won't do it again, but they should be in a good place fiscally for now. Float is high with about 1.6B shares out there. However today's volume at the time of writing is over 415M. That's not bad given such a high float. It's about 200% more than the average volume. 

The options chain on $SNDL has me giddy. With over 200,000 options currently in the money on todays move above $1 there is some high potential here for some interesting action. The put to call ratio is just obnoxiously low at .08 it's screaming upwards betting. If we hold above $1 the potential squeeze up could be amazing.   


It's also broken up on the trend lines and out of the downward channel it was in. The regression channel from the peak squeeze back in Feb just broke out today according to my crayons I have laying around. 

$TLRY

$TLRY was the squeeze of a lifetime if you remember it back in 19'. The ticker was just a money printer with it's low float and stupid hype. Then they proceeded to do, like they all do, and issue debt. Shares tumbled since then falling from $120 --> $5. Ouch bag holders.   


Like all the cannabis stocks the Feb bump pushed $TLRY to above $60 in an amazing move. $TLRY has a lower short interest than $SNDL, but it also has a much lower float at about 300M. Compared to $SNDL the volume here isn't as good, but still remains decently above the avg volume around 36M as of right now. 

If we peep the options chain we also see a crazy low P/C ratio around .11. But we don't have the Open Interest in the chain like $SNDL does unless you roll out to Jun 18. Then we finally get some decent OI.   


Personally I am going with $SNDL. The option's chain looks better, the stock is cheaper, and the short interest is a little better. My advice would be to roll out till at least the Jun 11th $1 strike to not get eaten alive by Theta and IV crush. But WSB does what WSB wants and that's why I love you all.   
Do not go above the $2 strikes IMO. You will get crushed by theta unless we get an insane move, which could happen but I don't see the risk / reward there.",Discussion,0.91

243,DNMR,nunagh,2021-06-07 22:53:38,$CLOV &amp; $DNMR Flash Buy Signals,"One tried and true method of deciding when to buy‚Äîand when to sell‚Äîis to watch the charts. Clover Healthcare (CLOV) and Danimer Scientific (DNMR) both flashed buy signals in the past few days. Both companies are the target of Short Seller attacks and law firms soliciting customers to join shareholder lawsuits. The good news is that both CLOV and DNMR are rebounding, and I think this is just the beginning. Both are well off their 52 week highs, and both have a long way to run.

One of the simplest methods for new investors to answer the question of when to buy is to watch the Simple Moving Averages (SMA). When the 5 Day Moving Average crosses the 30 Day Moving Average going up, it‚Äôs a buy signal. 

Using this method, AMC gave a buy signal on May 13th, when the stock closed at $12.98. We all know what happened after that.

https://preview.redd.it/6p6b9786ow371.jpg?width=1049&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf9859bdf9aae55e8c9789b566e21e2231460f85

This method isn‚Äôt foolproof. It will give some false buy and sell signals, and by definition you won‚Äôt catch the high or the low, but it will catch major up and down trends.   


**$CLOV gave a buy signal on June 3rd, when the stock closed at $8.90**  
CLOV also gave a false buy and sell in May, essentially selling it and buying it back at the same price.

https://preview.redd.it/7y4x7t5cow371.jpg?width=1049&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7350ae99bd09b9121e359dd44801208114c36cbd

**$DNMR gave a buy signal on Jun 1st, when the stock closed at $21.88.**  
Following this signal with DNMR, you would have had a false sell and buy signal in Feb and Mar, but you would have sold it at $37.90 on 3/25, preventing a long, painful ride down before it bottomed out at $15.38. Selling it at $37.90 and buying it back at $21.88 would also let you buy back more shares. 

https://preview.redd.it/n75xpi6kow371.jpg?width=1049&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5bae3f68eb5c966cf9fe8a9526d7d1b4fc64409a

Even with the occasional head fakes, this signal catches the long term trends up and down. I think it‚Äôs another useful datapoint to double-check your investment decisions.  
 

**Support and Resistance**  
 As another datapoint, both CLOV and DNMR are above most of their moving averages. CLOV is above its 30, 50, 100 and 200 day moving averages. DNMR is above its 30, 50 and 200 day moving averages, but still below its 100 day moving average.  
 

**CLOV**  
 30 Day SMA: 8.30  
 50 Day SMA: 8.19  
 100 Day SMA: 9.61  
 200 Day SMA: 10.55  
 

**DNMR**  
 30 Day SMA: 21.61  
 50 Day SMA: 26.06  
 100 Day SMA: 34.60  
 200 Day SMA: 23.90  
 

**Fundamentals are Strong**  
Both $CLOV and $DNMR have fundamentally strong businesses in the early growth stage. Clover is a small, growing healthcare company with proprietary software. Danimer Scientific makes biodegradable plastic resin, and is aiming to address the single use plastic waste crisis. I believe both companies have bright futures, with sales and earnings expected to continue climbing in the years ahead.  
 

**Short Interest**  
This isn‚Äôt the reason to buy, but it may be icing on the cake. According to Marketwatch, CLOV has 35.8% of the float shorted, well above GME (21%), AMC (18.93%) and BB (9.0%). DNMR has 15.8% of its float shorted. (I realize this varies from day to day and site to site)

**CLOV: 35.8% of Float Shorted**  
**DNMR: 15.8% of Float Shorted**  
 

**Summary**  
 I believe CLOV and DNMR have bright, promising futures, and I expect them to gain both short term and long term.

&#x200B;

$CLOV option volume (call volume) and delta to calculate the magnitude of the gamma squeeze.

If you've heard gamma squeeze left and right but have no clue wtf that is, [check this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nuo1kj/clov_45k_deep_otm_weekly_yolo_310000_call/h0zzli8?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

&#x200B;

Yesterday we had around 310.000 call contracts traded - by my assumptions, that's around 10M shares bought by market makers just to remain delta neutral. That's 10% of the available share float.

&#x200B;

Today, **within the 30 minutes of trading, there has been 150.000 contracts traded**. Many have certainly been sold (particularly below 15C) but above 16C it's majority new bought contracts - voluime > open interest - no one is selling naked calls surely. That's around 100.000 new contracts, at a delta of 0.6, which is around **6M new shares bought**..

The day is just starting. I'll update this within 1 hour

EDIT 1:

30min after, we have 250.000 contracts traded!

Meaning, 250.000 contracts traded, say 75% of contracts were bought, around 150.000 now with a delta of 0.9 and 100.000 with a delta of 0.6 = over **15 million shares bought by market makers** today.

NEW UPDATE: 2pm  


You modafockers thought this was over? It's not. 

&#x200B;

And the tally is at: **SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND** call contracts traded! Let's assume 70% were bought, then we have 280.000 contracts ITM - representing 21.000.000 shares retired by market makers and 8.000.000 OTM purchased by market makers. That's 25% of the available float that is locked by market makers to hedge against the call contracts bought.

Deep down inside, I think we all know that grandpa \*assuming his dementia has not set\* remembers the glory days of a Blackberry phone. See, it was a status symbol, an icon of the decade. Grandpa would stroll around on a night out in-town, pull out his Blackberry, and well that's how he met your Grandma, and your Dad was born. 

Grandpa watching CNBC this morning called his broker and yolo'd $BB.

Mods, this is not a shit-post. I see $BB as the entry point for boomers everywhere to feel a part of a rally in a company they actually \*think\* they understand. $BB is far from making status symbol phones, as they are doing more important things now. (EV, Security etc etc ) But, grandpa doesn't need to know that, and we welcome him because $BB is a company for both the young and the old.

Sup, WSB folks!

It‚Äôs Roman here with my Technical ANALysis, remember me? I‚Äôm the guy who [put the beard on the line, stating that GME is heading at least to thousands](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/), soon, and my beard is doing well so far, as you may see. Furthermore, recently I did [AMC TA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc_looking_juicy_next_resistance_targets_1623/), and it got to [CBS fucking news](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/)! Btw, the first major resistance there of $16 has been broken already, $20 is the next one and the things are going according to the forecast.

Congrats to AMC hodlers, but today we‚Äôll take a look at the superior stonk‚Äòs current TA state, discussing how things might play out in the shorter term perspective.

The first thing to take a look at this [GME](https://imgur.com/a/eAxaHhE) chart, is the beautiful Bollinger Bands setup. Bollinger Bands is a powerful TA instrument, used by traders for the purpose of identifying potential support and resistance zones, as well as a trend direction. Furthermore, BB is a helpful tool to work with the volatility, as price action‚Äòs fluctuations are taken as a cornerstone measurement for the Bollinger channels. As you should be able to see on the chart, with the volatility in Jan, Feb and Mar the BB channel looks thick (just as your BF‚Äôs GF‚Äôs ass). Since the beginning of April, though, the consolidation is obvious, and the channel consequently has been narrowing down. But BOOM, the breakout happened yesterday followed by the conformational solidly looking gap today. The setup of a very similar nature crystallized in January too (highlighted blue) and it is easy to see what happened afterwards. Juicy, what else can I say.

MACD. The thing points up, indicating the bullish momentum, with all of the threes indicators (MACD, Signal and Histogram) being on the bullish territory and accelerating with the current price action.

And the most important factor to üêª in mind, resistances. As I mentioned in the title, the Purple Haze ($233) is being tested currently, and to my understanding, this is the most important price level for GME currently (refer to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/) for the explanation). As soon as this one is conquered, $350 and $481 seem to be the next two major resistances on the horizon.

I hope, that you enjoyed this little piece of TA, have a great day!

# Products & Customers

* BlackBerry isn't just a phone company any more. They provide best in class cybersecurity.
* BlackBerry's most notable product is QNX, an RTOS with several applications. [Read here for more.](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le53ol/comprehensive_guide_about_bb_and_how_it_shall/)
* In December of last year, Amazon announced a multi-year global agreement with BlackBerry QNX and developed IVY, a cloud-connected smart vehicle data platform. IVY allows automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data and create actionable insights from that date. It's possibilities are endless, and I highly recommend reading more on Amazon's initial announcement.
* OK, so what the fuck does the point above mean? It means that **right now, electric vehicles are a gold rush, and BlackBerry is the one selling picks and shovels.** Through Amazon, IVY is going to become an integral part of the EV process.
* The market is sucking the dick of EV manufacturers, but EV production is low margin and low scale. **BlackBerry IVY is data monetization, which is high margin and has unlimited scale.** Within a few years, BlackBerry will be making much more than the auto manufacturers they're partnered with.
* Blackberry QNX is used by 23 of the world's top 25 electric vehicle OEMs.
* BlackBerry targets more than just EVs though. They also have or are developing products for healthcare, financial services, government markets, energy, gas, oil, and smart grid connected transportation.

# Cybersecurity Leader

* BB offers best-in-class security, safety, and reliability. 18 of the G20 governments are customers, and they are the only software company to attain various security certifications from the US Govt.
* Ransomware attacks have begun to impact American businesses like never before. Today, the commerce secretary stated ransomware attacks are here to stay, and that businesses should plan accordingly.
* You know that oil pipeline that was taken out by DarkSide ransomware and caused oil shortages across the southeast U.S? That wouldn't have happened if Colonial Pipeline were using BlackBerry. Something tells me companies won't be making that mistake in the future.
* According to Frost & Sullivan Research, BlackBerry addresses 96% of cyber threats, and 77% of Fortune 100 financial companies use BlackBerry software.

[Here's a list of BB Certifications obtained in 2020.](https://preview.redd.it/qey899yxnp371.png?width=1259&format=png&auto=webp&s=f51e571ce7afcaf17126b2c168cb3f7a37343c35)

# Some Basics and Fundamentals

* BlackBerry has an \~$8bn market cap with $1bn+ in yearly revenue and $800m in cash.
* Since 2016, the number of QNX products has grown from 50 million to 175 million.
* BB owns \~38,000 patents worth approximately $450 million.
* BB recently won a lawsuit against Facebook. I am unable to find the details, but most estimates are for between $1bn - $5bn total, paid over the course of a few years. BlackBerry's current market cap is only $8bn...
* Blackberry has a strong customer base of critical infrastructure already, and their pivot from hardware to software means continuous subscription revenue.
* **If BlackBerry had the same market cap as competitor Crowdstrike -** **who it outperforms** **- it would have a stock price of $83.** That's just taking into consideration one aspect of it's business model.
* [Vanguard has doubled their position since Dec 31/2020.](https://np.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lzw0pn/vanguard_is_bullish_on_bb/)

# TL;DR: üöÄüöÄüöÄ BB is going past the moon and into Alpha Centauri. This company is so much more than a meme stock or a short term squeeze - it's a life changing opportunity. When BlackBerry starts getting IVY revenue, $20 will look like a joke and you'll have to explain to your wife's boyfriend why you didn't get in under $14 when you had the chance.

# BIG EDIT:

**I was asked about the bear case for BB. It's important to understand the risks of investing, and I'm not so in love with this stock that I'm blind, so here's the bear case:**

* A lot of investors have been underwhelmed by revenue so far, and BlackBerry missed their expectations for Q4 2020. But it's worth noting the reason for buying BlackBerry right now is that when IVY revenue starts rolling in these concerns will wash away. It's a longer term play, similar to Palantir.
* The bull case assumes CEO John Chen's estimate of being able to get roughly $500m for their patents is correct. If they get less than expected for that side of their business, or keep the patents and aren't able to monetize them in a meaningful way, that would be less than ideal.
* The Facebook settlement could end up being more like 500m than the 2bn+ that's expected.
* They could be passed in the cybersecurity field before they are able to leverage their current best in class service. This one is really unlikely considering how many other companies have tried to make products equivalent to what BlackBerry has - and failed.
* EV companies could end up making their own OS and data services to resist IVY adoption. Several are trying (Tesla always comes in this conversation as an example), but from everything I've read none have managed to make as safe and comprehensive a system as BlackBerry.

So, *if* IVY doesn't get adopted, they're no longer the leading cybersecurity company, their lawsuit is for less money than expected, and their patents are actually worthless - then BlackBerry is only a little undervalued instead of incredibly undervalued.

**Here's the most meaningful bear case right now though, and how the bulls can beat it:**

There seems to be a lot of upward resistance. Establishments, institutions, etc. are all convinced BB is a failed phone company stock worth $10. When it rises, large financial players short (because they believe they can buy back for $10 or less), buy puts, or just scalp to try and capitalize on the volatility which in turn creates a lot of resistance and breaks momentum.

I don't think there's any conspiracy, I think the big players are just incompetent. These are pretty normal pullbacks and reactions to a stock that's gaining so quickly. The problem is that those big financial players I mentioned (as well as a lot of people on WSB) don't understand *why* this stock is so desirable. They just think it's a meme stock that's being pumped and don't understand the potential of: A) Becoming an essential step of EV manufacturing; B) Being best in class security during an age of ransomware attacks. So instead of getting in and riding the momentum, they create a self fulfilling prophecy of pullbacks.

**The bulls can win the same way we've won in GME and AMC - by buying and holding. Continued days of large volume will completely fuck the bears who started taking huge short positions last week, leading to even bigger price movement. Buying shares or LEAPS and being patient is the way to play it and win big.** The bears win when bulls waste all their capital buying FDs that have no chance of finishing ITM or when they see a dip and paper hand their shares. It's funny to watch people freak out at a $2 dip when they easily could have just hedged that with a deep OTM weekly covered call. **Buy** ‚û°Ô∏è **Hold** ‚û°Ô∏è  **Yacht**

Regardless of the resistance that exists at the moment, there will come a day when big finance starts racing to get in on BB - and they'll pretend they were right all along. We've seen it constantly in tech stocks over the past few years. WSB can just expedite the inevitable by getting in on BB while it's still incredibly cheap.",DD,0.88

Congratulations, and fuck me, right?

(Not a financial advice)

Starting from the basics. The first step in any technical analysis, should be to identify the current major trend, including both a short term and a longer term scales. Referring back to April 2020, and up to the first half of December 2020, the consolidation of a flat nature (with several expansions) is prevalent - in the price action diapason of $9.5 to 11 dollars as the upper resistance. As 2021 was approaching, during the last days of December, an extensive upward impulse took place, flirting with $14 resistance level. 
From the current perspective, that rapid price movement looks like a conventional bull trap, to get poor animals slaughtered fast and cruel. And the commencing consequently nasty downtrend supports that proposition - starting on the 28th of December and lasting up to the 11th of May. Talking about a week long period, there is a retracement bull-run apparent, still in action.

The bearish four and a half month old trend outlined above should be of a prior interest for us here, because it is the major market setup to play in currently. As for the next step, it‚Äôs a good idea to grope the key downtrend resistance levels, which will both magnet the price action as well as recalcitrating it should the price action come near. The first and the most powerful resistance line should be drawn from the lowest point of Dec 28 daily candle‚Äôs tail, and include the following apexes: on Feb 4 (not touched, but not far); Mar 4; Mar 18; Apr 29 and May 13. Based on how this resistance surpassed the price action, it is appropriate to consider it the most important resistance the bears had in hands. As it had been broken the day before yesterday, it may be viewed as a bullish signal.

With a caution, definitely. Because there is the second most important downtrend resistance overhanging: just connect the December 28th daily candle‚Äôs opening price point with Dec 29, Jan 4 & 11 apexes, and the third of March shot opening price.

Moving further, another important tool worthy to be applied here is Fibonacci retracement (who would have guessed?). The starting point of the downtrend measurement being easily identifiable (28 Dec), and the final price point is not too difficult to find here too (the bottom low of $6.33 on May 11). You should notice, how well Fibo applies here, and how the price action confirms that by playing with these levels and in between those. Recently $8.13 (23.6% Fibo level) was conquered, but there is a significant resistance at $9.24 (38.2% retr.) and another solid one at $10.14 (50%). This price diapason ($9-10) seems to be insurmountable as a resistance zone from the current point of view, coupled with the 150 daily simple MA and the second resistance described in the previous paragraph, all converging in this zone.

Speaking about volume, the increase is evident recently. However, in order for the price action to conquer the resistance zone outlined above, a lot more (and I mean A LOT) buying volume is necessary.

MACD and StochRSI indicate the incipient bullish momentum, rolling up from the bearish zone and both pointing up.

TL;DR: So, buy UWMC? Dunno. Overall, a mixed setup, with additional confirmations necessary in order to enter the trade confidently. The reversal of a four and a half months downtrend is apparent, but the outstanding selling pressure (elaborated above) coming from $9-10 diapason looks scary to me. The best play for now would be sitting out and observing from the distance, with a careful entry as soon as $10 level (and preferably $11) is broken and confirmed as a support afterwards. YMCA looks solid though.

I hope, you‚Äôre happy now, u/memetron9000!

274,TLRY,nktkfy,2021-05-25 18:18:02,Legalisation of marijuana is proceeding. Possibly TLRY (Tilray) will explode soon,"The US House of Representatives passed a bill last month that would allow banks to provide services to cannabis companies in the US. Thus, the banks would no longer operate illegal and unlawful financing should they offer loans and other services to the companies. That would be a huge step in removing what analysts are calling an obstacle to the development of a national cannabis industry.

Legislators voted for the bill with 321-101 votes and sent it to the Senate.

https://preview.redd.it/5mpqdo4tja171.jpg?width=660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1255ec4f5a2471772ca27ad86ea25c16167d241b

The bill clarifies that proceeds from legal cannabis deals are not considered illegal and instructs federal regulators to create rules on how they would oversee such banking activities. Banks have so far been unwilling to do business with companies that sell marijuana or related products, fearing they could run into conflict with US federal law. This has left marijuana companies with few options to rely on a handful of small financial institutions or do cash deals. The American Bankers Association has aggressively lobbied for the SAFE Banking Act bill.

The banks have been in a difficult position due to the conflict between state and federal law, so it makes sense that Congress must act now to resolve this conflict. Thirty-six US states have now legalized medical cannabis, while 17 states already allow recreational use of cannabis by adults.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would try to push legislation. The positive reaction of the stock prices of Tilray, Sundial Growers, Aphria or Aurora Cannabis shows the great relief of investors. Investors hope that this could have kicked off further progressive reforms in the cannabis sector. This move took the potential of a game-changing marijuana law an important step forward.

If Congress passes the SAFE Banking Act and President Joe Biden signs it, it would likely become much easier and cheaper for marijuana companies to raise the capital they need to fund their growth initiatives. The law should also make cannabis companies safer and more efficient, as credit services would reduce the need for cash in day-to-day operations.

I'm gonna keep it short and simple for you. What do we like? Squeezes. While some of us are still waiting for the mother of all short squeezes, another type of squeeze is setting itself up in $CLNE. 

For those of you who are not in the know, $CLNE is a company that recycles natural gas from garbage dumps and uses it to fuel trucks and other commercial vehicles. If you've heard of Hyliion, Clean Energy would basically be their supplier with the difference being that they already have the necessary infrastructure and already make money selling their product.

But the fact that this stock is great long term hold and has its PT set between 11.00 and 27.00 (a great upside from today's price) by the end of the year is besides the point of this post. We want tendies, and we want them now.

And here's how to get them. $CLNE has become a very illiquid stock which means that purchases have a great effect on the price action. As pointed out by /u/NrdRage, a purchase of only 3000 shares could make the price action move up nearly 10% and it would only take 6 million dollars in capital to trigger what made you click the post : a gamma squeeze. 

As you all know by now, gamma squeezes are triggered as option sellers are forced to buy the underlying when there is a good chance that the options they sold will be ITM at expiry. Here is the current open interest (contracts for which the sellers would have to buy shares as the price action approaches the strike) for the June 18th expiry :

Anybody else see a nice lift-off ramp? I sure do.

As an added cherry on top, the stock has been severely suppressed by short sellers in the past week (namely Blackstone, a 3x leveraged hedge fund), which might be forced to cover in the event of a gamma squeeze.

You're making money right now on $GME, $AMC, $BB, or whatever. Allow me to introduce you to a company with boomer level fundamentals that took a haircut during the pandemic and is set to fucking explode. 


The company name is Tellurian, ticker is $TELL.


--------MY KNOWLEDGE AND BACKGROUND----------

Even though I have a double digit IQ, I am in charge of keeping energy producers from blowing up, spilling fuck loads of oil, catching shit on fire, and/or keeping seafood fresh and hydrocarbon free. I've been in the business for many moons. I have dealt with MANY companies. I‚Äôve seen MANY business types, I have seen transitions in business models as producers have dealt with energy price crashes. I work directly with company executives all the way down to operators and hands. I like talking to everyone and absorbing as much knowledge as I can, even though I‚Äôm mentally retarded.

Even though you morons can‚Äôt read, have your wife‚Äôs/gf‚Äôs boyfriend read this to you and DRILL it in your fucking smooth brain: LIQUID NATURAL GAS (LNG) DEMAND IS RISING AND WILL CONTINUE TO RISE FOR THE NEXT DECADE (‚ÄúdEcAde‚Äù is a period of ten years for you single digit IQ fucks) AND BEYOND. LNG will be the ‚Äútransition‚Äù fuel between dirtier energy sources and ""green"" energy. This transition is coming sooner than we think. 


Are you following?


What's this LNG, you might ask. You need to liquefy gas (basically ‚Äúconcentrating‚Äù it) so that it becomes economical to ship overseas. Overseas markets for LNG is massive and growing. Seriously look it up, EU, China, and others are increasingly relying on the stuff. It‚Äôs much more expensive for them to produce than the US.

When a producer (the company that puts together millions of dollars to drill a well) drills for oil, if your drill and zone prediction (a ‚Äúzone‚Äù is the area that a geologist, paid for by the producer, finds to contain oil) is correct, 99% of the time, three products will flow to the earth‚Äôs surface in your process. These three are water, oil, and NATURAL GAS. Producers will separate oil and water dispose of this waste water into a disposal well thousands and thousands of feet deep. Producers will then sell the oil.‚Ä¶ What happens to the gas?? Well, if the producer is lucky, there will be a pipeline within a mile or two of their well. They will have to pay WAY over 200K to 500K just welding a mile of gas pipeline to tie into this sales line then pay 100 to 250K for a LACT unit. This is why oilfield welders have fewer IQs than I do but make $150/hr, depending upon pipeline wall thickness (dependent upon flowing pressures and how safe the producer wants to be if not bound by DOT regulations)

If these costs aren‚Äôt too high, and the well is producing as much product as expected, then great, they sell gas. However, if they're producing less oil than predicted, or they're producing thousand of barrels of water per day, their disposal costs will be so high, they can‚Äôt afford to build the pipeline, they will just burn the stuff. Seriously, I can not tell you HOW MUCH GAS IS JUST BURNED. The VAST majority of producers just ‚Äúflare‚Äù the gas. Just the ‚Äúflare‚Äù vessel is like $30K. Imaging paying $30K to burn LNG that's worth 100s of thousands of dollars. I worked in the Permian basin in West Texas. Anyone here with this experience can vouch for me. At night, in the Permian, the sky is literally lit up with these flares. It‚Äôs like you're a goddamn ant on a fucking birthday cake that‚Äôs for both for your great great great mothers and her boyfriend‚Äôs birthday (basically a shit load of candles). It‚Äôs an amazing sight.

¬≠---------wWhY dO tHeY DoO WasTE gAAS??------------------

You‚Äôre in the middle of fucking NOWHERE. You‚Äôd have to run hundreds of miles of pipeline to sell the gas. This would cost more than drilling the well. No company in their right mind would do this. The only options is to flare it. This one company I was working for was burning over 100K worth of natural gas per MONTH PER WELL, they had FIVE wells. The US just burns the crap, we can produce it so cheap, it just makes more sense to burn it rather than bothering to sell it. Gas is a nuisance to us. Other countries would die for it. There is actually new technologies that converts LNG into GASOLINE for cars. If you‚Äôre a stupid brain dead fuck who doesn't believe me, fucking Google it. 



-------So what about this TeLlUriAn coMpaNIee?-----------

Charif Souki started Tellurian. If you don‚Äôt know who he is, he is a LNG god. He was a banker on Wall St, highest paid CEO years ago, pioneered the LNG industry. He and his team are impeccable. If you want to build a LNG empire, you hire Souki, if you want to know the future of hydrocarbon energy, you hire Souki, if you want a new boyfriend for your wife, you hire Souki. He built Cheniere Enerny (about 2 hours from my house), a company with $10billion in revenue and is trading $80/share. 
He was fired because Carl Ichan was a complete bully. The business was not being built to Soukies vision. Soukie took the best staff members along with him and started Tellurian. Can you imagine their trust in this guy? Leaving an established company to start a new one... LNG business model is requiring a change and Soukie realizes this. It will need to be produced at less cost, current business models aren‚Äôt sustainable. Cheniere Energy is over 20 BILLION dollars in debt. Yes, $20 BILLIOOONNNNNNNN. Guess how much debt Tellurian has? ZERO, NONE, $0.00. This is UNHEARD of in a new company in this industry. 

Tellurian just signed a 10 BILLION dollar purchase agreement from ONE company. TELL is currently talking deals with at least 4 other companies. This 10 billion dollar deal is a 10 year agreement. This is 1 billion per year. Their current market cap is just over 1 billion. Do you realize yet how undervalued this company is?? It‚Äôs mind blowing. They begin their Driftwood facility construction in Louisiana this summer. This will be the terminal to export LNG, 32 billion dollar project.

Do you know whats even better?? They wont completely rely on third party producers selling them gas to liquefy, BECAUSE THEY DRILL AND PRODUCE THEIR OWN GAS. They started drilling again after a brief pause due to covid-19. We pay for monthly reports of all producers who receive state permits for drilling. Just this month Tellurian has TWO permits.

Souki uploads regularly to YouTube (seriously what other major high level executive does this??), he was on Jim Cramers show multiple times, Jim Cramer was always contrary to Souki‚Äôs predictions, and SOUKI ALWAYS turned out RIGHT. Look it up, these are Jim Crammer‚Äôs words, NOT mine. Just a day or two ago, Souki said in his YouTube video ‚Äúwe are preparing for the ride of a lifetime.‚Äù I assume this is his way of telling us ‚Äúbuy in now you fucking retards‚Äù without being fined by the SEC.

------------HOW is ThiS LIKE GME, AMC, BB?-----------------

THE SHORT POSITIONS OMG YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS BY NOW. IT‚ÄôS 17%!! Most of these positions were taken out at pandemic start. The joke is on them, Tellurian paid off their debts during their worst time HAHAHAHAHA. There WILL be a short squeeze. These shorts have no fucking clue about this dream team, the true depth of industry, and future of LNG production. 


---------------------hOw MuchH CanI MAKe?---------------------

At the VERY VERY least, I‚Äôm betting we run to pandemic level of $10-11/share (REMEMBER THIS WAS BEFORE THEY EVEN SIGNED ANY PURCHASE AGREEMENTS!!!). Calls are still cheap.

305,UWMC,neg3ey,2021-05-17 15:20:55,$UWMC - The Long View,"$UWMC has become one of the most hyped stocks in the online investment community. Online activity appears to be ramping up after earnings and heading into May 21st option expiries. Since UWM is getting a lot of new eyes, it seemed like an appropriate time to share why some investors may consider UWM as a long term hold. 

UWM is a mortgage company that focuses exclusively on the broker channel. It‚Äôs the largest wholesale mortgage provider in the US and the second largest mortgage originator, behind Rocket Companies. 

It‚Äôs CEO is Mat Ishbia, who started as it‚Äôs 12th employee and who‚Äôs dad, Jeff, started the company as a side hustle. Mat and his brother own 94% of the company in Class D shares. The rest of the public float, \~100m Class A shares, are what is available for the public to purchase. 

# What trends are pushing $UWMC‚Äôs stock down? 

**The largest threat UWM is facing is raising interest rates**: 

About 75% of UWM income is related to refinance activity. The pandemic pushed rates to historic lows so most consumers were better off refinancing. Millions have done that, leading to record profit for mortgage providers like UWM and Rocket. 

**The strength of the broker channel:**

UWM is completely dependent on brokers finding business and closing loans. It doesn‚Äôt have any direct-to-consumer lending operations like Rocket does. 

**Short Interest:** 

Sophisticated investors are seeing 75% of income potentially attached to rate sensitive products (not all refi‚Äôs are rate sensitive like cash out), and are salivating. They think the market is under appreciating this headwind and shorting the stock. They have basically shorted all the shares they can. Friday the stock ended with 200 shares available and an insane 93% borrow rate. 

**SPAC:**

It is true that the SPAC market has softened recently. It is very reasonable to assume $UWMC is a part of that softening. It may not attract institutional investors because of the SPAC situation and the short period it has been publicly traded. Lots of other nice places to put institutional money.

**Competitors:** Mortgages are a mature market and competition is fierce. Rocket, LoanDepot and UWM mentioned a pricing war in their earnings. (LD statement). This will compress loan sale margins in the short term. 

**What trends are pushing $UWMC stock up?** 

**Short term retail pressure:**

there is a lot of retail attention on the potential short squeeze/gamma squeeze you could see this week in UWMC. My post is about UWM‚Äôs long term perspective, so I‚Äôll let [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ndcm0p/uwmc_is_a_powderkeg_low_float_high_short_huge/) take you further down that rabbit hole. Additionally, smart money is now tracking online sentiment, which can lead to increased institutional purchases. 

**Broker Channel Growth:** Mat has claimed two reasons for taking UWM public. He wanted access to the liquidity market and marketing exposure for the broker channel. For UWM to become the largest mortgage originator, Mat has targeted ‚Öì mortgages to be originated by brokers and UWM to own 50% of that channel by 2025/26. Currently UWM owns 36% of the broker channel with brokers originating 20% of all mortgages. Before the housing crisis in 2008, brokers were 58% of mortgage originations (Per Mat & Q1 2021 Earnings call), so it isn‚Äôt crazy to think they could get back to ‚Öì as it is growing: [https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum](https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum)

I had a loan with Rocket and tried to refinance with them. I then went through a mortgage broker and got the same loan for $4.5k cheaper in closing costs. This is because Rocket‚Äôs retail channel has 4% margins and it‚Äôs partnership network (includes wholesale, realtors, etc.) has 1% margins. 

**New Product Offerings:** 

UWM recently released new products like their jumbo loan. In earnings, Mat said he expects $2b in volume from Jumbo. They also added ARM‚Äôs, manufactured homes and expanded government programs. 

**Wholesale mortgage provider consolidation:** 

Mat said 3 of the top 25 wholesale lenders have been purchased in the last 90 days. This type of consolidation happens in mature markets by companies that are reaching for market share. THis could be a sign companies are under pressure to grow but cannot organically get market share from UWM. 

**UWM ‚ÄúAll In‚Äù Ultimatum:** 

Rocket and Fairway are priortizing other channels (cause the margins are so much higher) and trying to squeeze out brokers. UWM said if you work with those two, don‚Äôt work for us. The goal was to stand up for the broker channel WHILE putting some pressure on Rocket and Fairway‚Äôs partnership channel. This may have kickstarted the pricing war. 

**Aggressive Capital returns:** 

UWM pays an annual .40 dividend on its class A shares. That only costs them \~$42m/year. Remember their Q1 net income was $800m+. So their dividends hardly affect the balance sheet. The board just approved a $300/million share buyback as well that will reduce share count. Mat knows a thing or two about shorting stocks. He just sold at $10 and has authority to buy back with the current price under $8. The man successfully shorted his own company. What a legend. 

**Long Term Prediction:** 

I‚Äôm invested in UWM because I believe the capital returns will be aggressive during the upswing and the company will remain profitable in a downturn. With a 5%+ dividend return, share buyback, and \*potentially\* growing market share, UWM could be primed to overtake Rocket within the next few years.

Yadda yadda, not financial advice, if you buy yourself a ticket to Ramenistan that's on you. My favorite color of crayon is purple.

I'm new to this sort of thing (first write-up I've ever made lol) so I want holes to be poked in this relatively surface level DD. I'm also not the most knowledgeable on the intricacies of the steel manufacturing industry, since I'm going off of pure numbers.

With COVID recovery underway and the slow unfreezing of world economies, steel companies have been outperforming the S&P 500 by large margins, and this is one of those companies. I've noticed that compared to other players in the steel industry (X, NUE, STLD for example) MT's price is much lower than these players, and yet their fundamentals are roughly the same, if not better.

All statistics here are pulled off of [barchart.com](https://barchart.com/) and Yahoo Finance.

&#x200B;

Bull indicators that stand out to me

* P/B and P/E indicate undervaluation
* Relatively benign ROE and ROA, and yet other companies are trading at higher prices than MT
* Competitors who are smaller cap are trading at much higher prices

Bear / Neutral Indicators

* Negative profit margin (which can possibly be indicative of repayment of debt or new acquisitions)
* High amount of stock issued - dilution contributing to the lower trading price

On the fundamental  side of things, if a second wave of COVID hits, infrastructure and building development will begin to lower demand, thereby reducing price. However, the US government's infrastructure development plans could offset any pitfalls in demand made by COVID.

ASO is actively climbing now after for weeks I've been trying to wake you idiots up.  I said they were great because their p/e was good and I was called a boomer. I said it was shorted 40 percent and I was told it's not amc. I said DKS blew it out and my posts were autofiltered.  

So....

Aso has a P/E of 9.7 you goddamned idiots. 
Aso is small compared to Dick's and has enormous room to grow you shmuck.
Aso is the go to for team sports, outdoor sports, grilling, camping,  just about everything outdoor.
Dick's sporting goods blew out their earnings causing their PE to go from 16 to 9. ASO is likely about to blow theirs out, and when they do it's could bring the PE from 9.7 to 5. Given the fact that they can take so much more profit share, well you see the logic

You are small minded cowards who can't think outside the herd consciousness of WSB. You respond almost exclusively to negative reinforcement. If I were a ring master with a whip you might listen, but the closest thing you're going to have to the whip is FOMO and you're about to get that.

I don't know if The admins only allow through the ticker symbols that they hold or what, but the idea that this stock has to sit and flounder when it has an easy 60% upside without even a short squeeze or gamma squeeze just blows my mind.
So let's just forget about the idea that the company has tremendous potential for growth, has The opportunity for his short squeeze and a gamma squeeze, or could attain the status of meme stock.
Still, as a value stock it is way way way undervalued. You can buy and sell it till the cows come home, when earnings come out this stock is likely going to shoot up just like Dicks did. I'm giving you a suggested play is all.

I am just so frustrated with what happened today and the discussions I have been seeing that I sent a few comments and now honestly just need to vent, maybe someone can get something out of this retard's ramblings or we can have a discussion about any of what is below without attacking one another, maybe it will only help one person and that is fine it is better than saying nothing at all.

People who have been here for awhile probably will find little value in this post but who knows maybe you will. Hell, newer people probably wont either but it could be useful to think about some of what I have to say who knows I did too much brick red shit is getting weird.

***Keep in mind obviously I am retarded and my opinion is terrible, do not read further. I sniff glue, and none of this is financial advice all it is meant to do is engage your brain to think about things before picking sides or spreading information that could cause harm. Also, Excuse my grammar its worse than my investment strategy.***

I am generally curious to hear thoughts about the current situation in both what happened to AMC today or anything related to it, and I guess just general thoughts surrounding both BB and AMC without shitting on the other with misinformation and FUD. It is starting to look like a BB vs AMC brawl at the moment with AMC getting shit on for a terrible misguided reason. I don't know how many people are actually contributing to said shit but ***ignorance breeds FUD.***

I am not going to attack people investing in BB or anyone talking bad about AMC or vice versa because everyone is entitled to their own opinion and can say and invest in whatever they want to, I just hope you can think about both sides and research into it yourself before doing so at the least. Honestly, I believe that both companies have potential, I lean more toward AMC because I know more about it  (which is not much because again I am retarded) not because BB is terrible or a dumb investment I just do not know much about it so I will not have a strong opinion on it. I will however be looking into it tonight because more knowledge is always a positive. The more we educate ourselves, the better decisions we can make. That being said I think AMC is being shit on a little harder because of the FUD that happened today with AMC price and the media's pushing of BB and spreading AMC FUD as well. Paperhands more than likely contributed heavily today with short attacks to suppress AMC gainz but this is just speculation.

AMC's sold shares to Murdock 2 days ago and also some to the market today and it is being blown way out of proportion in a negative fashion which in all honesty it could very well be very advantageous to retail's gainz. On the surface that statement sounds insane to most people who do not know much about the stock market or business operations in general. If you look up information directly from AMC and try to understand what was actually done and why it was done and logically think about it instead of trusting others 100%, Today could have played out very differently. I'm not saying it was a terrible day by any means just stating that it possibly could have been better if FUD could have been spotted and stamped out by retail more efficiently by thinking for themselves and not relying on others most of the time. 

**Retail needs to be VERY cautious when reading about ANY news they hear about the market, retail has completely flipped the market upside down and media will be a huge factor in trying to get retail ""back in line"" we have seen it happening for months. There is and will also be more retail to flock to these stocks that will drive volatility higher which means retail must not accidently spread FUD and learn to think for themselves based on data and facts given. If we do not think for ourselves a little more, and be more skeptical about what we hear, less tendies will be had.** 

The 20m shares that got issued were going to go into the Outstanding shares regardless if they sold them to the market. The shares were going to be given to the executives of AMC for their personal benefit, instead they used these shares to secure capital to be used in the future benefit of AMC and thus retail, the shareholders. They gave up personal gain to have more capital infused into AMC, this to me is very good news. The only way shorts do not have to cover is AMC going bankrupt which capital they gained from those shares helps to avoid. **These shares were basically going to be a bonus that AMC executives refused in order to give it to the company.** Think about all that has happened to AMC, then think about what you hear happen at failing companies and what their executives do before said company goes tits up. Ill give you a hint they usually dont try to decline bonuses to help the company. Granted you could argue they are nowhere near close to claiming bankruptcy, but even so more than anything I think it proves that they actually give a shit and are grateful to retail for saving their ass, then I must have ate too many crayons.

About the ""dilution"" problem, think about it logically. Do you think that roughly 20m shares that were added on two different days with \~480M and \~590m volume on the days in question, to a share count that is already somewhere around 500M that is roughly 80% owned by retail already is fucking us over? If you think it does, is it really enough to jump ship / spread FUD? It could be, who knows, but my retarded brain thinks otherwise. I am not telling you what to think but rather to actually think about it/ research it and come to your own conclusion. Even if you have no interest in investing in AMC spreading negative things about it only hurts the other so called ""meme"" stocks that directly correlate to it.

AMC no longer has any shares to sell they have 46k shares left, which means retail will have the final say on any vote in shareholder meetings as they own the majority of shares and AMC can not ""dilute"" the outstanding shares if you believe that is actually what they have been doing with ill intent. They want to have the ability to issue 25m shares and given the circumstances that AMC just survived I think it is a good idea to have that option in their back pocket as they literally don't have to use them unless needed. **I am not telling you that you should believe what I believe.** I know a majority of retail might not agree with my opinion and that is completely fine I just want some thought to be put into it, think about it and research it yourself. If you come to the same conclusion then vote against it in the meeting. **Retail will have final say in the deal so we must be educated about any matter like this that may come to a vote**. This deal might be completely irrelevant in fact it probably is but who knows it is better to be prepared so an informed decision can take place. Retail literally has final say in decisions that can effect an entire multi billion dollar company. What Retail decides in any vote will effect the company and in turn each of the individual investments in it. Give it some effort

We all know what happened today with AMC price (6/3/2021). I Don't think it was the best day ever by any means but it was not all that bad. Considering the circumstances with the confusion that happened throughout the day with shares being sold by AMC, especially when you factor in new investors who are not yet accustomed to the FUD seen everyday ***Midday was was one fucking hell of a ride.***  We should think about the positives of today as well as the negatives instead of focusing mainly on the latter. I think today was nowhere near as bad as what some would think.

One final note, The live stream of AMC's CEO Adam Aron answering questions Is one of the main reasons I will continue to support AMC. **In my own personal opinion** I am extremely hyped for what is going to happen tomorrow. I could be completely wrong but it seems like He knows what the hell he is doing and he actually gives a shit. I know there is an argument that could be made that it was all an act because of retails majority share ownership. I just don't get that vibe from him, the man sounded like is taking us seriously or at least that he actually is taking steps to understand retail as best as possible in order to make decisions we would support as a majority. If you have not watched it yet I would recommend doing so if you are interested or are already invested in AMC. **Remember there are legalities that a CEO has to follow which could account for some of the things being said by Adam. I did not look into this but it is something to consider if something seems off, that doesn't mean that everything that seems fishy is because of this.**

I'm not going to end with some speech about holding the line or be proud. Just give thought to everything you see, be skeptical and do some research. The more of this that occurs the better off retail is as a whole, and the better off you as an individual will be in securing your tendies.

Anything said above was for the purpose of discussion and getting people to really give it some thought and effort before believing/spreading everything that seems like it is true or that you want to be true.

TLDR: Ignore entire wall of text and watch Adam Aron answer [Questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-EkPZMIAeM) then maybe read above if not just try being more skeptical of everything and put the research and thought into your actions. Effort will be what makes the difference. Emotions are peaking and it important we stay vigilant.",Discussion,0.85

The current CPI numbers stand at 4.2 percent which is the highest they have been since Sep 2008 (the increase was almost 4x of what was expected). 

https://preview.redd.it/rj016ez2k2171.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=1442c59a2d4c3ec1bac1511e4482602fea7b779b

While it is definitely [questionable](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) to showcase the annual inflation rates like how they have done here, the sudden rise in inflation that we are seeing currently can have serious long-term effects. To understand how increasing inflation can have detrimental effects on the market as a whole and the stock prices, first, we have to understand the basics of inflation. 

**What is inflation:** To put it simply, inflation can be considered as the rise in price of goods and services which in turn reduces the purchasing power of each unit of currency. As prices of products inflate, each unit of money undergoes a proportional drop in value. [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) is an extreme example (they had to print banknotes of 100 Billion) of what happens when a country does not control its inflation and goes into hyperinflation. A sudden rise in inflation can have an insidious effect on the economy: The raw material prices increase; consumers can purchase fewer goods, and revenue and profits of companies decline until a new equilibrium is reached.   

**Is it a serious concern among investors?** 

https://preview.redd.it/izi11ho4k2171.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcb3937bd948713d0212e5e160997ea135606f54

I analyze mentions and sentiment of various stocks to identify trending ones. I used the same data I collected to see the number of mentions of inflations and how it trends with S&P500. As expected, mentions of inflation have a negative correlation with how the market performs and we can see that it has exploded over the past few days. 

**How does inflation affect stock price?** 

The relationship between inflation and stock prices is not straightforward and no single rule applies. In the long run, shares can act as a hedge against inflation. i.e, the companies had enough time to adapt to the inflation in input prices and adjust their own prices, thereby increasing revenues and passing down the cost to consumers. 

But let‚Äôs be real here. None of us are interested in the long-term behavior and want to know the short-term impacts on stock prices. In general, stock prices have an inverse correlation (as can be observed from the chart above) ‚Äì i.e, as inflation rises, stock prices fall. This can be attributed to multiple factors such as falling short-term revenue and profits, general economic slowdown, and a prospect of lowered real returns. But the single most important factor to consider for short-term stock price swings is interest rates.   

**Interest Rates** 

https://preview.redd.it/r3x8iy46k2171.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=c25e4c38b82564549d283e0da696d8b8cbe3c2c7

The U.S federal reserve interest rates have been near zero from the time pandemic hit the country. This caused the market to be on a massive bull run over the past year as there are no attractive alternative investments that can generate a respectable return. This, along with the massive Covid economic relief bills, channeled a massive amount into equities (bonds with almost no interest were not an attractive investment anymore)

https://preview.redd.it/zdqrr0u7k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c297c21ae704ea4c8fb07da1d0b5fa57d6cedf8f

‚ÄùMoney printer go brrr‚Äù was not just a meme. 1/5th of all US currency in circulation was printed in the last year. Out of this, only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. While the Fed still hasn‚Äôt announced any concrete plans for an interest rate increase, it certainly is on cards if the inflation continues unabated. 

**What does it mean for my portfolio?**

Historical research indicates that during high inflation periods, growth stocks drop in price. This is predominantly because the valuation of the company is based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company, thereby adversely impacting the share price. 

https://preview.redd.it/3vg0lqm9k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f27c1616ad1560f271ff3a318b4ae301d434a626

Depending on where you believe our current economic cycle is, we have multiple options. If you think that the market is still in a recovery phase, you can still continue to invest in Growth stocks but if you believe that the market is overheated and inflation would be the final trigger for a slowdown then Value stocks, Commodities, and Real estate investment trusts can act as a good hedge against inflationary market changes. 

**Conclusion**

The short-term plays based on inflation entirely depends upon whether you believe the Fed‚Äôs explanation that the current jump is transitionary in nature and will settle down, or that the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force the Fed to increase their interest rates leading to the end of the bull run over the last one year. Whatever the case may be, we are in for some wild swings when the next inflation report comes out.

Not a single share has been covered, in fact there were more borrows this week (yes Hedges are shameless). I also want to emphasize on the lock up period for CLOV. The insiders cannot sell a single class B shares until the price is $30 for at least 90 consecutive days and have 700 million in cash so no need to fear any insider dumping/dilution like other companies. I have not sold any shares. I expect a much much bigger return for my investment**

I want to start off by saying this is not a post comparing CLOV to GME or AMC. While these stocks have some similarities, particularly being targeted by hedge funds for short squeezes, I‚Äôm not going to get into that. This post is for anyone who is somewhat new to investing, still learning about shorts and squeezes, and those of you who are more knowledgeable but want the full picture of what‚Äôs going on with this stock. You can also think of this post as a Part 2 to [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CLOV/comments/ngesez/this_is_the_bottom_and_youll_be_top_of_the_world/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Brief description of my last post - it was about the stock reaching its bottom at $6.80 and only going up from there (which was correct).

**TL;DR - Currently, the highest number of options purchased have a strike price between $7-18 for every single month. The goal is to stay above $12 to create a snowball of options being executed, thereby causing a gamma squeeze - the higher the strike price, the higher the limit to execute and the hedges are worse off.**

**What Is Clover Health?**

Clover Health is not just another insurance company. They have combined Medicare insurance services with new patient-centered technology aimed at facilitating the ease and effectiveness of diagnosis, treatment, and most importantly, prevention. This company should not be classified as a health insurance company, but a tech company. Their AI learning and database, Clover Assistant, make it easier for providers to eliminate unnecessary and repetitive lab testing, repetitive diagnoses, and it consolidates a patient‚Äôs medical history into one platform. This not only saves the patient headaches from navigating our decentralized healthcare system, but it also saves both patients and insurance companies an enormous amount of money by avoiding duplicated efforts. 

Currently, CLOV covers 66,300 customers across 8 states out of the 61,212,247 Medicare beneficiaries nationwide, which equates to .0011% of the beneficiary population. As you can tell, this number is extremely low, which makes sense since they are a brand new company. When they reach even 1% of the beneficiaries, this company‚Äôs stock price would be $100+ based on fundamentals alone. But I expect these numbers to skyrocket as they gain more members and their AI learning database improves more and more.

[CLOV Medicare Advantage Plan by &#37; of growth compared to competitors \(cloverhealth.com\)](https://preview.redd.it/wuoalim07q371.png?width=3297&format=png&auto=webp&s=b38cba4adeb4fcbbeae5d53ea93751964480113a)

CLOV has huge long-term growth potential, so the risk to reward is extremely favorable towards getting into the squeeze. Let me explain why.

**Positive Catalysts**

All the negative catalysts are out of the way and everything is priced in. Here are some positives I‚Äôm keeping an eye on: 

* DOJ/SEC case dropping or settling (even if CLOV is found guilty of taking advantage of Medicare, it will still be positive because at max they‚Äôll pay a fine and that‚Äôll be over with). I highly doubt CLOV will be found guilty though because the Hindenburg claims are rather baseless and the DOJ were forced to inquire about this only because it‚Äôs related to Medicare. 
* Biden‚Äôs health care proposal reducing the Medicare qualifying age below 65 would create millions of new beneficiaries. The hype around the proposal alone will create a huge stock price increase in all healthcare-related stocks, so CLOV will definitely benefit.
* CLOV is officially added to the Russell 3000, who will have to purchase a ton of CLOV shares.
* PR of any new partnership, expanding to further states, and increasing current partnerships. They‚Äôre growing rapidly as is, so news like this is bound to come out in the near future.

**The Dark Clouds Surrounding CLOV**

* As previously mentioned, the DOJ inquiry is still lingering and it‚Äôs unclear when it will be settled. Although it‚Äôs priced in, it is still something to watch out for.
* Hindenturd‚Äôs constant attacks despite insisting they don‚Äôt have any positions. Why would Hindenburg attack Chamath Palihapitiya even though they aren‚Äôt benefiting from it, according to themselves? This relates to the GME/AMC squeeze; Chamath was a big proponent of the push against the hedges. He was outspoken about the squeeze on several occasions and gave GME his validation, which in turn hurt Citadel and other hedges shorting GME immensely. Hindenburg‚Äôs report was created to hurt all of Chamath‚Äôs IPOs, especially CLOV. Basically, this is retaliation against Chamath for standing with the retail investors, and if I had to take a wild guess, Citadel has paid Hindenburg to write this baseless report. I‚Äôve added a link at the bottom of this post about the Hindenburg allegations and the counter from CLOV for those who were not aware of all the allegations. (PS - Despite all the negative press surrounding Chamath, his track record is stellar.)
* The constant manipulation by short sellers to create negative incentive. For instance, the fake lawsuits by Lifshitz that are shady at best; if you go to their website, you‚Äôll find the phone number listed goes straight to voicemail. All their social media lead to Wix.com platforms instead of their own. And, **THEIR PHYSICAL LOCATION DOES NOT EXIST** as shown in Google Maps. Lots of red flags.

**Let‚Äôs get down to the nitty gritty - The Daddy of all Short Squeezes**

CLOV is currently over 42.58% as of Friday, making it the highest shorted stock on paper (and it‚Äôs unclear how many naked shorts there are, which could easily be 70-100%+; it‚Äôs impossible to know since those shares are shorted illegally). THE SQUEEZE IS INEVITABLE, it‚Äôs just a matter of how much more the short interest increases, which will correlate to a bigger squeeze. Furthermore, the borrowed interest on CLOV stock has more than doubled to 3.7%, meaning those who are shorting have to pay much higher interest on borrowing the stocks, and that number will only continue to increase as demand increases. Soon, they won‚Äôt be able to borrow anymore stocks and will have to short it naked in order to suppress the price further, essentially digging a gargantuan hole in which to bury themselves.

[CLOV S\/I&#37; as reported by Ortex](https://preview.redd.it/yem0laz57q371.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0602994d6bc0ddc1305c2737a8b1d70de3f7c58)

No need to fear the company dumping their shares or diluting it because the Class B shares are locked up - the directors aren‚Äôt able to sell any shares until the stock price stays above $30 for 90 consecutive days or more. The company is $700 million cash flow positive and no debt, therefore there won‚Äôt be any dilution.

The P/S ratio is considered a particularly good metric for evaluating young, potentially high growth companies or companies in cyclical industries that may not show an actual net profit every year. Let‚Äôs talk about CLOV‚Äôs P/S ratio for a moment. 

CLOV‚Äôs 2020 revenue was $672.9 million compared to $462.3 million in 2019, which puts it at 45.6% increase in growth. They beat their own expectations and those of analysts by a wide margin. In 2018 and 2019, the market valued tech companies with IPOs at an average of 11.7 and 10.4 times (respectively) their previous 12 month earnings. Conservatively, that would put CLOV at $7 billion market cap, which is around $20+ fair value. But in 2020, that number doubled, which would increase CLOV‚Äôs market cap significantly. However, for this consideration, I‚Äôm using the 2018/19 valuation to be conservative.

**Bottom Line**

The fair value of CLOV is anywhere from $20-30 fundamentally, which makes it a very risk-free, undervalued stock that has been suppressed by short sellers. But this post is not about the fundamentals - this is about exposing the short sellers‚Äô manipulation of CLOV. On paper, this company is shorted 42.58% (though this is MUCH higher when you include the illegal naked shorts that aren‚Äôt reported), making it the highest shorted stock as of Friday. This number could go much higher as short sellers continue to borrow stocks and suppress the price further, which only hurts them more the longer this is shorted. As is common knowledge from previous squeezes, hedge funds are not going to cover anytime soon; they have to be forced by triggering their margins. As the Fed hinted recently, hedge funds are the most leveraged they‚Äôve ever been in the last 20 years, which means retail investors can take advantage of them just like they‚Äôve been taking advantage of retail investors for 100s of years.

I don‚Äôt know how much it could squeeze, from $50-150 or much higher, and there‚Äôs no telling where the ceiling will end up. The squeeze is inevitable, whether you or I buy it or not, but the process of how long it will take is up to the retail investing community.

Many are missing the point.

Even if an instrument is going to the moon, it doesn't mean the current entry is a low risk, high reward proposition...

Bear with me guys, here is the  famaous digital Dog   chart to exemplify this point. Fear of missing out is NEVER a good idea. Look how far you are from the moving average... I feel vertigo just looking at it.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x67cnp5evgy61.png?width=1665&format=png&auto=webp&s=335c9d39eff4e40743e8d537787822b7f4e1f433

You might feel like a star buying here, as the price might go parabolic some more... but what you didn't know is you're walking a high strung tight rope. The slightest wind and you come tumbling down 1000 metres.

Unless you are a good sentiment reader, it's hard without a chart to really see how dangerous the situation is.

Now to some  silver charts! Check out the setup for silver  .

 Here we go!

**Evidence #1 - US Dollar and inflation adjusted**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bhi4hxovwgy61.png?width=1825&format=png&auto=webp&s=41b14643cd570a05387b455f08e154b9d8c7739f

 Inflation adjusted shows the truth to how your purchasing power has been subdued, even if the US Dollar index had strong bear market rallies since 1980.

Half-life of 15 years (US Dollar loses 50% of it's value every 15 years).

New bearish cycle is about to start.

Silver & friends will have a strong tailwind.

 **Evidence #2 - Gold vs Dow Ratio** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rh5mmal3xgy61.png?width=1828&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc91b3183804c58e77330288e998a25010bf83ca

 Point and figure charts remove time scale meaning, and add new columns only when price action reverses sufficiently (else it just fluctuates in same column).

When US equities go in BUBBLE MODE, gold (and silver) get relatively cheaper, creating a low risk, high reward entry points.

We are at similar points prior to a 1929 crash or 1972 inflation cycle.

Buying silver or gold now is not buying EXPENSIVE, but historically CHEAP.

**Evidence #3 - Silver vs Dow's 3 ""inflation adjusted"" cycles**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9gtc4d2gxgy61.png?width=1838&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bf7822f7a5da4856e13fc475914b0d8da4108b2

 Arcs are a powerful tool to identify a downtrend, the slowing of that downtrend, and the eventual rise from the ashes.

When you get 2 bounces off the right hemisphere, the new uptrend is confirmed and probabilities of a sustained uptrend is increased.

Angle of descent is usually angle of exit.

This JUST happened now.

**Evidence #4 - Silver's 50 years bi-monthly log chart** 

Once the price is out of the red cloud, it is GO TIME! You may start to fly 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sdr2m405zgy61.png?width=1828&format=png&auto=webp&s=db5c954c04d705e9dfebe81bb33d5a576dbd9fce

**Evidence #5  Lastly - Silver's Relative Strength to SPX ( US equities)**

Another view for silver, now comparing it's performance vs SPX (US equities). When the capital flows leave US equities and start flowing in silver... it creates an explosive move. Don't believe me? check out the chart right below. 

https://preview.redd.it/tet12j4bzgy61.png?width=1828&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb61d89486d5ec0cf4a33c8ab7bed7986fba54ad

Notice the differences? Fear, and more fear. Close to the moving average, the risks are low, especially in a precious metals bull market. Nobody on mainstream media talking about silver really nowadays .

 **Conclusive Thoughts...**

THE INVESTMENT OF THE DECADE

 I‚Äôll just put this out there - silver is ABOUT TO GO TO THE MOON. This is the buying opportunity of a lifetime. A group of people around the whole world are buying up all the silver to drive up the prices. Everyone's doing it, and you should do it too.

**AMC**

(Bloomberg) -- Retail investors in India and South Korea have joined the meme-stock frenzy by piling into **AMC** Entertainment Holdings Inc. through local trading platforms giving them access to U.S. markets.

The money-losing movie-theater chain is among the five most-traded U.S. stocks over the past week on both Vested Finance and Stockal, two India-focused platforms for retail investors to buy U.S. equities. **AMC** Entertainment has accounted for 14% of trades on Vested this week, a greater proportion than Tesla Inc., Shopify Inc. and Facebook Inc.

**AMC** Entertainment closed 18% lower on Thursday after soaring 95% on Wednesday. Its dizzying surge in the past few weeks has pushed its market capitalization briefly above $33 billion. The craze for so-called meme shares such as **AMC** and GameStop Corp. is being fueled by pandemic-led lockdowns and low-fee trading plans that have encouraged new investors into global share markets.

‚ÄúDue to social media platforms like Reddit, information today travels quickly across borders and an Indian investor is as plugged into the U.S. markets as their counterparts in the U.S.,‚Äù said Viram Shah, chief executive officer at Vested in Mumbai. ‚ÄúSome retail Indian investors are driven by news and want to be part of any global trends or movements.‚Äù

Sitashwa Srivastava, co-founder and co-chief executive officer of Stockal, said that in the last three to five months, ‚Äúpeople have been chasing high volatility stocks a lot more. GameStop happened, and now, AMC is of great interest.‚Äù

**Korean Favorite**

Korean investors snapped up $225 million of **AMC** shares from Monday through Thursday, according to Korea Securities Depository data. That total is getting close to three times the amount spent on the second-most-purchased counter, Tesla, at $82 million.

A popular online forum among Korean retail investors contained dozens of posts from traders known locally as ‚Äúants,‚Äù discussing the prospects for **AMC** stock prices, and whether Blackberry Ltd. might replace AMC as the next meme target.

Michael Burry, the infamous investor who profited massively off the 2008 housing bubble is predicting, like many others, a collapse of the bond market. (Source: Scion Asset Management 13F) [He was even payed a visit by the SEC due to this warning](https://www.businessinsider.in/stock-market/news/big-short-investor-michael-burry-says-hell-stop-tweeting-after-sec-regulators-paid-him-a-visit/articleshow/81569128.cms), prompting him to delete his twitter account.

The FED only has two options at the moment:

Raise rates to curb current inflation. This would cause the treasury to raise its coupon rates (bond interest), which would mean lower bond prices. This means the government has to pay higher interest, ultimately leaving the treasury no other option than defaulting on its obligations.

2. The FED doesnt raise rates, and lets inflation (and later hyperinflation) eat away at the dollar. This would also make the bonds worth less, as theyd have to lower the price to compensate for the interest being worth nothing. In this situation, the fed would be the only one willing to hold government bonds which would worsen the inflation as they effectively dont get payed interest on it.

Option one, the government goes bankrupt due to interests being to high to pay back. Option two, the public goes bankrupt due to hyperinflation.

Either way, a short position would profit in this trade.

Here you can see we **broke out of a large descending wedge on Friday** (with fantastic volume). This is the same pattern damn near every speculative growth stock has been caught in for the past few months. Normally it has a bearish bias - because it is coming from downside. However, in this scenario - **it broke up -** which means **we can see some fantastic follow through to the upside.**

The price targets for this setup would be **22.61, 26.18, 28.05, 29.71.** These are all resistances - and in a normal situation you would either trim as we run into these, or scale in as we clear them.

However - given the news catalyst - it's hard to say how high we will gap up on Monday. Above that last level is **34.84** and **36.63.** It's unlikely we cross these without an insane short squeeze, or another pattern forming (at least on the shorter term charts).

Remember, each time we clear one of these levels on a **daily close -** it will become a support. As a result, you can trail your stop loss below them as we continue.

This is one of many examples of **""technicals precede news""** I have encountered throughout my trading career - and one of the reasons I try to ignore anything except for the charts while I am trading. It's hard to quantify arbitrary events - and especially hard to do so without bias. Thankfully, we will often **break out of a major pattern prior to a news release -** like you see here.

I'll be looking to day trade this stock next week depending where we open.

***TL;DR*** \- $SPCE broke out Friday & has positive news to help it along next week

Price targets are **22.61, 26.18, 28.05, 29.71**

Much of my knowledge of the markets has been acquired through reading countless hours of DD posted by others.

OBLIGATORY - BuY & HoDl!

Now that that is out of the way, I would like to reference a few authors and their inspired DD that helped get me to this point.  The below have DD's that are a must read if you have not already; please visit their profiles and read their posts.  I will attempt to summarize the main points briefly below.

u/Criand:

[1)]**The flurry of rules before the storm. GME might be hitting T+35 and T+21 next week**

[2)]**Things are shockingly similar to the February 24th and March 10th runup**

u/myplayprofile - I am highlighting just one of their posts, but it goes into linear correlation which is now shifting to logarithmic correlation between GME & AMC prices.  AND he explains how there is the possibility that AMC is being used by hedgefucks to hedge their GME losses.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

This post is focused on u/Criand's DD, which enlightened me and many others as to what the fuck has been going on with the 21 day / 31 day FTD cycles.

Basically his DD over the last few weeks is the most accurate hypothesis that we have to date regarding the FTD cycles, and one of his most recent posts shows how this theory is now supported by the price action seen on May 25th and in the following days.

Key Points:

* He clarifies the confusion around why the standalone T+21 day FTD cycles, which have been shown to cause price surges, do not act the same way as they did during the $480 run and the $350 run.
* Explains how the Feb-March $350 run was caused by a dual event of T+35 & T+21 day FTD cycles occurring in close proximity to one another (back to back trading days)
* Notes that the Feb 24th initiation of the run up to $350 was exactly 10 days before we peaked at $350
* He references u/yelyah2 DD, which shows how gamma neutral spikes on day 1 of the $480 and $350 price run ups, returns to normal for about a week, and then spikes up massively again, initiating the January and February Gamma Squeezes

Below is my furtherment of u/Criand's work all in one concise graphic which feels oddly like a child to me right now.  Not sure if that is just because I have not really written any DD's before.

Please click the image to view it blown up and actually take in what is being laid out for you with my lovely computer crayons which I swear to god I don't eat... EVER.

[Transparent boxes represent the initiation of the combined T+35 \/ T+21 day price movements + 6 days \(because it has only been 6 trading days since ](https://preview.redd.it/v8tmo6hdi5371.png?width=1287&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a7e70813852641f29b2e57d8fc64ea7f7b83f77)

Notes:

* I am not sure why I called the $480 and $350 price run ups in the visual ""Micro Squeezes"", but thats what came to mind.  Perhaps gamma squeeze is more appropriate given u/yelyah2 recent DD?
* Yellow is micro squeeze 1
* Blue is micro squeeze 2
* Pink is the past 6 days

Alright folks.  I have talked a lot about other peoples work, and given you a graphic.  Now comes my value add.

Key observations:

* Not only was it a 10 trading day ramp up from the February 24th initiation to $350 on March 10th, but it was also **EXACTLY 10 TRADING DAYS** between the January 13th initiation to the $480 peak on January 29th.  My reason for calling this out specifically is that it strengthens the theory surrounding the combined T+35/T+21 day price movements, and helps us further establish that we could potentially go **PARABOLIC AGAIN 10 trading days from 5/25 on JUNE 9th.**  Will they be able to stop us this time?  Maybe it doesn't even matter if the do... See my next points
* In the aftermath of the January ""micro squeeze"" the Dec-Jan price floor of \~$20 **DOUBLED**, and the new price floor was set at \~$40 between Feb 5th - 25th.     In the aftermath of the Feb 24th - Mar 10th ""micro squeeze"" the price floor of \~$40 **TRIPLED**, and the new price floor was set at \~$120 between Feb 5-25.  Given that the price floor doubled and then tripled after these two events, **could we be expecting the new price floor of more than 3X $120?** (That would be a price floor of $360+ for those of you who needed help there)
* Edit to previous bullet: someone makes a fair point that ""We can‚Äôt assume that since it doubled in January from $20 to $40 and tripled in March from $40 to $120 that therefore the next floor must be more than 3x $120. What if the rule in the sequence is +20->+80->+140? Or what if +20->+80->+20->+80?""  I have included this just to explicitly state that my question **""could we be expecting the new price floor of more than 3X $120?""** by no means is intended to say the price floor WILL triple again.  I feel like this is a good point to say that this is speculation and theorization based on observation and nothing more.
* The MACD line has literally only had significant crossovers (golden cross) 3 times this year.
   * Event 1, Yellow ($480 run)
   * Event 2, Blue ($350 run)
   * Event 3, Pink (May 17th - today)

Additionally, I have plotted trend lines for each of the events.

* Event 1 (Yellow) we saw a 10 day increase of roughly 1,733%
* Event 2 (Blue) we saw a 10 day increase of roughly 770%.
* 770 / 1733 = 44% or a 56% reduction in 10 day price increase, although the price was starting from a floor of $40 instead of $20.
* 44% of 770% would be 338% starting from $120 which would mean a peak price of \~$405 in event 3, **IF** this short pattern continues exactly the same.
* THIS PATTERN WILL NOT CONTINUE EXACTLY THE SAME.
* I am only observing the trend of the current pattern.  The sample size here is literally 2 events, albeit 2 very unlikely ""coincidental"" events.  And I don't believe in coincidence.
* The pattern will break for many reasons, but the main reason is that hedge fund manipulation literally cannot continue forever.
* Once they get margin called its off to the races, and hopefully this event is the straw that quite literally breaks the camels back (Kenny G, you are the camel)

Oh yeah... forgot about this one.  LOOK AT THE VOLUME.  ITS LITERALLY FUCKING INSANE.  MEDIA IS PUSHING AMC, KOSS, ANYTHING OTHER THAN GME AND YET IT HAS RUN UP FROM $132 (April 13th) TO $290 WITHOUT A SINGLE TRADING DAY VOLUME GREATER THAN 21 MILLION.  WE SAW VOLUMES OF MORE THAN 150 MILLION IN JANUARY!

Alright guys.  To summarize.  We could be looking at going parabolic again on June 9th based on the pattern identified by the authors I mentioned above.  The price action and technical signals are bullish as fuck.

392,AMC,nnriwg,2021-05-29 18:55:02,AMC Volume Price Analysis,"  

Hey fellow traders. Today, l‚Äôll present to you a very strong bull case on AMC that is not explained by simply putting a rocket emoji (I love this emoji by the way) or because someone else posted a strong YOLO bet on the stock. Here is my analysis based on volume, price action, and a powerful pattern named the flag, high and tight.

&#x200B;

[Weekly chart](https://preview.redd.it/5bruexp383271.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=f679d9584a983071eaf036df2e4c5be14069eaae)

Firstly on the weekly chart, we see a high tight flag that started developing from the low on January 5th at $1.91 (#1) to the high of the pattern which was achieved on January 27th at a staggering price of $20.36 (#2). In 17 trading days, the stock soared 1065.96%. It‚Äôs an understatement that this price action caught my attention. The following months saw the stock consolidate in a flag, high and tight on falling volume. Bulkowski studied this pattern extensively and it‚Äôs one of his favorites. HTF is characterised by a rise of at least 90% (aim for double) in less than 2 months followed by a consolidation period on ideally falling volume. I think we easily meet these criteria! The performance rank of this pattern in his work is 1 on 23 in a bull market (1 being the best) with an average rise of 69% and throwbacks happening 54% of the time. Price meets target 90% of the time. The measure rule helps us acquire a potential price target for this trade. In his work, Bulkowski tells us to measure the rise and project it 50% past the breakout point. With the measure rule, using the breakout point at $12, we would have a theoretical price target of $63.96 (1065.96/100/2\*12)). Now to the analysis based on volume and price.

On the weekly chart, we have the breakout on #3 with rising and above average volume. This confirms the breakout is not fake, but supported by the professionals. After the minor pullback, we see the momentum exploding and the price action ripping past $20 on very high volume. Like we will see on the daily chart, the last trading day of the week saw some heavy selling which can be seen with the long upper wick on the weekly chart. 

I attribute this to two things. First, the stock rose to overbought levels and a pullback was imminent. Two, the stock hit the ATH of around $35 and many market participants saw this as a good point to take profits.  While it is true the SI rose in this period, I do not believe shorts created this long upper wick. Seems more likely professionals were taking money off the table. This being said, I do not think we are witnessing a trend end since strong momentums like this one cannot be broken in a single day. Like a big cargo ship, it cannot be stopped simply by turning off the engine. More effort will be necessary to break this rocket for sure. On top of that, the most conservative assessment would bring us to $63.96 in less than 30 days (around June 10th) following the breakout and we have a 90% chance of hitting this target according to Bulkowski. If these are not good odds, I don‚Äôt know what is. I truly believe this is an opportunity of a lifetime!

&#x200B;

[Daily chart](https://preview.redd.it/wslu122983271.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a1d2f718d41538d8bfad7ffad44ade99c796356)

On the daily chart, we can see the flag, high and tight develop from January 27th on #2 to the breakout at #3 on May 13th. Developing this cause is important according to Wyckoff‚Äôs law of cause and effect. The development of a cause will be proportional to the subsequent effect. On May 14th (breakout day (#4)), we see rising and above average volume that confirms the start of a new trend. Then, the test of supply on the pullback at #5, we see falling volume until the stock reaches $12 which means there is no interest in selling at these prices. The rally resumes on very nice long white candles on steadily rising volume which means volume and price are in harmony fully supported by the great professionals. 

On the second to last candle, we see some selling happening as shown with the upper wick. On #6, we see a tall black candle that closes very close to the prior day‚Äôs close. I associate this candle with the bearish meeting lines candle. Bulkowski‚Äôs work establishes the candle to be a continuation pattern 51% of the time in a bull market, which is pretty much as valid as a coin toss. If the next day‚Äôs close is below this candle, Bulkowski tells us there is a 70% chance the candle acts as a reversal. So this is to be looked at closely for next week. The long upper wick and shorter lower wick associated with very high volume tells me there was more selling happening Friday by the professionals. 

We must remember that stocks do not trend in a straight line. Volatility is cyclical, and all this is normal price action. Even in the event that Friday‚Äôs price action is stopping volume by the great professionals and the beginning of a distribution phase, Wyckoff‚Äôs work tells us this is associated with a potential preliminary supply and this stopping action ALWAYS fails and thus the rally WILL continue. Ladies and gents, I cannot stress enough how AMC is trading currently at a discount and any entry point is a good one at this point in time. We do not choose our seats on a rocket ship! You get in, strap on, and enjoy the ride! Trying to perfectly time the bottom on any pullback is a fool‚Äôs errand! Looking back at the daily chart on AMC, #1 (hanging man) and #3 (dark cloud cover) shows us that any bearish candle in the recent history of this stock is likely to be very short lived. Shorting this stock based on the bearish meeting lines (weak bearish candle by the way) would be a very dangerous endeavour indeed.

[30 minutes chart](https://preview.redd.it/erdc846b83271.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ec91557abfecf685c4af681eaf68f0da6a1fd9b)

Lastly, on the 30 minutes chart, friday we see at #1 strong buying pressure as seen with the long lower wick and high volume at $25.50. #2 was a retest on falling volume meaning falling interest to sell at this price. I do believe we have strong support at this level.

No one has a crystal ball and this could go either way, but the odds are that we reach $63.96 by the end of June with a 90% probability according to Bulkowski. I am adding to my position at any dip in this stock. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qbs706tc83271.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=8669186d98ef0792b216b50992969cd1d08fe785

If history is of any guide, I expect AMC to have a short consolidation period with falling volume like we saw with GME before the great run up. Thus, I believe we have another week to add to our positions before this really takes off. Any close above 35$ will be extremely bullish

I‚Äôve been reading many posts explaining the short squeeze potential and this adds to the excitement of a strong bull run in this stock way past $63.96. AMC is currently the most shorted stock in the market as we speak. Though I have doubts that AMC will reach 500k like many claim, I do believe we have a strong squeeze potential in this stock as shown by the candles and volume recently printed on the charts. Ultimately, volume and price will tell us when it is time to close our positions.

Cheers,

20$ 07/16C AMC

30$ 07/16C AMC

Edit: Just to be clear, Bulkowski‚Äôs HTF gives us a 90% chance to hit the target in the next 30 days after the breakout. This target is his CONSERVATIVE target not MY target. I do NOT plan to sell at this target. I have no price target at this time since it could squeeze to 10k for all I know. More price action is needed to accurately assess a higher target.",Technical Analysis,0.91

394,BYND,nfh8o2,2021-05-18 19:50:03,$BYND Meat HALAL CERTIFIED TODAY,"[Here](https://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/isa-furthers-its-partnership-with-beyond-meat-with-the-certification-of-the-new-iteration-of-the-beyond-burger) is one of the many articles stating that as of today BYND burgers are now HALAL certified.   


If you don't know what Halal is or why this is relevant then you are probably not Muslim or Hindu. The certification will now give BYND a huge customer base boost in my opinion. Impossible Burgers did this in 2018 so the alternative meat market in the UAE has already been introduced. I think BYND is set to capitalize on this new certification especially as meat markets are already negatively impacted from COVID issues.   


$BYND also is sitting >20% short float so any upward movement in this stock could potentially start a quick move up. The stock is sitting near $100 and to me looks to be at a nice floor psychologically ($100 is a nice round bottom for people to buy near).   


Finally the OATLY IPO is coming quick. The alternative meat / protein space will likely be the talk of the town at near the end of the week which may bring BYND up or down with it as the IPO happens. The good ole sympathy trade...   


Disclosure: No I'm not muslim / hindu but I do have family that is. This certification gives them ""confidence"" that during the holidays they can still eat this food. It also allows them to serve this food at events, which is something I know has been an issue in the past for us personally. If it's not Halal it won't be served at a party / event.",Discussion,0.8

Ill point you to the same chart I did last time [https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/steel](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/steel) as you can see it still shows 0 sign of slowing down anytime soon. But aside from this chart lets talk about some recent events to prove why this chart is true.

&#x200B;

**Berkshire hathaway share holder meeting**

Warren Buffet himself talked about how they keep seeing raising commodity prices. He talked about how steel prices kept going up everyday. He used the example that general motors has to keep paying more for steel everyday. He said the economy is red hot!

**China steel rebate officially drops to 0%**

[https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/metals/042821-china-removes-vat-rebate](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/metals/042821-china-removes-vat-rebate-on-steel-exports-cuts-tax-on-raw-material-imports-to-zero) previously I spoke about how China was just talking about this being a possibility of this happening. However this has now happened. It being so recent it has yet to really have a massive effect on steel trade. However as the last of many companies steel reserves go empty they are going to have to eventually purchase more from China. This will not only increase China's export profitability since many countries were trying to compete with China's steel prices they will no longer have to and be able to keep marking prices up as the super cycle continues through the year. No more price competition on steel will simply drive prices further through the roof since ""cheap steel"" no longer exists.

**Steel demand continually on the rise while supply cannot keep up with demand.**

[https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/worldsteel-raises-2021-steel-demand](https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/worldsteel-raises-2021-steel-demand-growth-forecast-to-5-8/) Another very recent article talking about how steel demand is affecting multiple sectors in the industry. Covid-19 put a large halt on steel demand now that the great reopening is happening across many countries demand is revving up as steel mills have to ramp up production to the nines because they did not produce as heavily in a low demand market.

**Summer construction season.**

Many roads and bridges as we all know are worked on exclusively in the summer months. Not many companies have large reserves of rebar just lying around. As time goes on the prices are only going to go higher. These companies will have no choice other than to pay these ridiculous prices. Creating stronger demand as we go into these summer months.

**CLF beat Q1 earnings expectations**

Just a little icing on the cake [https://www.bizjournals.com/cleveland](https://www.bizjournals.com/cleveland/news/2021/04/22/cleveland-cliffs.html) they beat expected earnings by 2 cents EPS. Next quarter is expected to be even higher please stay tuned!",DD,0.93

399,LNG,nt8spt,2021-06-06 01:56:31,Tellurian $Tell annual shareholder meeting this week and likely third deal announcement that could kick off Stage 1 LNG Export project construction! This is going to be a huge value play!! üìà,"I was updating my original DD post this evening. ([Original DD Link for reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/TellurianLNG/comments/l8aspr/tellurian_tell_long_term_investment_outlook_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) After doing the math, if we have deals with similar terms such as Souki mentioned, we need one more to hit the Stage 1 benchmark. Each of the recent deals is for 3 mtpa marketing takeoff. *We have a gap of 2.5 mtpa assuming Total sticks with their agreement terms or modify's slightly as the expectation was FID by June 2021.*

One deal released a week for three weeks, leading up to the annual shareholder meeting next week. It's perfect execution on PR leading up to an all-out celebration by the leadership team. Souki can give the üñï to the shorts, Total for selling part of their shares, and get started with construction this summer to build out the local infrastructure, FID, and then NTP (notice to proceed) in Q1 2022 with Bechtel. üí∞

I believe the next deal will be with Korea Gas Corporation (KOGAS) or Sinopec.

KOGAS has the lion's share on their market and recent tweets about South Korea, Tell CEO being appointed to South Korea / USA business council. [https://mobile.twitter.com/TellurianLNG/status/1396127896939515906](https://mobile.twitter.com/TellurianLNG/status/1396127896939515906)

Sinopec recently signed their first long-term LNG contract with Qatar Petroleum for 2 mtpa. They're actively looking to secure future energy needs.  Let's do 2.5 or 3 mtpa with Tellurian and USA to have a larger contract than Qutar.  'Murica.

**Driftwood Project Stages**

|Stage|Plants|Capacity in mtpa|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Stage 1|Plants 1 & 2|11.0|
|Stage 2|Plant 3|5.5|
|Stage 3|Plant 4|5.5|
|Stage 4|Plant 5|5.5|
|Total||27.6|

SNK‚Äôs comment brings a great perspective on takeoff with Souki‚Äôs comments on mtpa being greater than Stage 1 alone. The overflow would start conversations about Stage 2. Construction of plants 1, 2, 3  could begin together.

&#x200B;

|Project Capacity|Percent of Assets|mtpa|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Original - Tellurian|40%|12|
|Original - Equity Partners|60%|15.6|
|Likely - Tellurian|58%|16|
|Likely - Equity Partners|42%|11.5|

&#x200B;

|Partnerships|Contract Type|Capacity in mtpa|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Total|Equity partner|1|
|Total|Marketing|1.5|
|Gunvor|Marketing|3|
|Vitol|Marketing|3|
|Total as of 6/4||8.5|
|Required for Stage 1||\-11|
|Remaining as of 6/4||\-2.5|

&#x200B;

Operating Costs on FOB (free on board) forecasts were mentioned around $3.50 to the water if I recall, which could be based on the project financing provided upfront through equity partners. Since the majority of the deals are from the marketing offtake, I assume the financing for Stage 1 will need to be secured by Tellurian via loans or infrastructure programs. This self-financing could put operating costs near $4.50 mark.

Project finance could be sourced by having a foundation of long-term take contracts with investment-grade partners. They list the credit rating of parties. With the recent infrastructure bill and the government's attempts at direct access to the bond market, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if bond issuance or infrastructure funds was part of the equation. Project partners such as GE or Bechtel could step up in agreements to provide sourcing. The majority would be bank debt. I hope stock issuance isn't the route taken.

Driftwood Stage 1 EPC contract costs $700 per ton. Lifted to $710 to adjust for market changes in 2019. I believe 1-2% lift is an understatement with current supply cost changes. I've seen a 5% rise in labor costs alone in 2020/2021 in my industry. Short term I would push closer to the 14% rise. That would be $98. This rise might not last the entire duration of phase 1 construction. I'll guesstimate $45. $745 per ton.

|Operating Costs|$/mmBtu|
|:-|:-|
|Drilling & completion|$0.88|
|Operating|$0.36|
|Gathering, processing & transportation|$0.79|
|Contingency|$0.22|
|Liquefaction|$0.75|
|Debt|$1.50|
|Total FOB|$4.50|

**Price Targets**

$1 just in asset valuation - Acquisition of Magellan Petroleum Corporation (Haynesville Gas Production Well) is valued $400M.

2021 - March/July = $4-$10 - Deals announced gap-up (3B valuation / 409M shares). $7.34

2021 - September or FID announced = $12 - 5B in capital in (5B valuation / 409M shares) $12.22

2024 = $37 at Stage 1 Project completion (15B in valuation / 409M shares).

2025/2026/Mid-decade will see a peak in Demand/Supply pricing where LNG company's valuations could get frothy.

Future: 40% capacity equals $70 a share

Future: 100% capacity equals $120 a share

Max would be 100B valuation / 409M shares at $245. Equity partners could comprise 60% of equity that would eat into total available shares.

MOON TIME! üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ","Industry groups from Japan and Finland will conduct¬†joint¬†research and development of sixth-generation¬†communications technology, looking to lead the creation of 6G standards in a field increasingly influenced by Chinese companies.

Finnish telecom supplier Nokia, a global leader in the industry, will join the effort.

Japan's Beyond 5G Promotion Consortium will¬†sign the¬†agreement soon with Finnish group 6G Flagship. The accord is to be announced Tuesday at the Global Digital Summit 2021, an event organized by Nikkei and Japan's Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications.

The initiative follows a [$4.5 billion commitment](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Telecommunication/US-and-Japan-to-invest-4.5bn-in-next-gen-6G-race-with-China) by Japan and the U.S. toward the¬†development of next-generation communications technology, in¬†a partnership announced in April.¬†Extending the¬†cooperation¬†to ""third-countries""¬†to promote secure connectivity is seen helping¬†in the competition with China to set global standards.

The Beyond 5G Promotion Consortium, which aims¬†to commercialize 6G technology in the 2030s,¬†includes the University of Tokyo along with major Japanese telecom players such as Nippon Telegraph & Telephone,¬†NTT Docomo, KDDI, SoftBank Corp. and Rakuten Mobile.¬†6G Flagship is led by Finland's University of Oulu.

Members of the Japanese consortium¬†will engage in joint research projects and¬†personnel exchange. The group is in talks for future collaboration with an American¬†counterpart that includes¬†telecom supplier Cisco Systems and chipmaker¬†Intel.

Shares of 5G patents owned by Japanese developers have¬†fallen behind the likes of South Korea's Samsung Electronics and U.S. player Qualcomm. NTT Docomo holds¬†about 6% of 5G¬†patents, compared with roughly 10% for Qualcomm and China's Huawei Technologies.

The internal affairs ministry aims for Japan to¬†command at least a 10% share in 6G patents together with a slice of 30% or more in equipment and software.

417,UWMC,nawd69,2021-05-12 20:54:55,Why is $UWMC the Best Meme Stock Today?,"I wrote a DD on $UWMC pre-earnings. ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n9xrrg/is_the_market_right_about_uwmc/)). It was obviously too long for people who can't read.

All other meme's stocks are trash today and $UWMC is the only breakout winner. Today's market movements show what UWMC investors already knew: Mat Ishbia is pissed Wall Street doesn't like his company.

See, Mat Ishbia has been in the trenches building UWM from 15 employees to 8,000+ for about 20 years. He did it profitably without outside financing. He sold 7% of his company to take it public at $10/share and Wall Street has been crapping on it ever since.

Remember when you were a kid and took hours drawing that nice picture for your dad and he looked at it for .5 seconds and said, ""You're shit at drawing."" and then went back to drinking his coffee and reading the paper? Yeah, that drawing is $UWMC except the kid is Mat and he is a billionaire.

Here is what is special and unique about $UWMC. The 100m+ shares of the float represent a small fraction of shares. So Mat's personal wealth is affected greatly by little Kenny on Wall Street trying to make a few bucks shorting it. Ken has millions on the line, Mat has billions. And if you don't know this about Mat, dudes a bonafide winner.

He is taking on Rocket Mortgage and plans to be the largest originator in America in five years. He keeps saying he is growing and Wall Street isn't listening. Now... he has a $300 million share buyback war chest, 5%+ dividend, and a tiny float. He just needs a match but the board gave him a flamethrower.

In the conference call he said, ""At these prices, I'm a buyer."" and seemed genuinely giddy to buy tomorrow.

So this price action is just the start of the share buybacks. I'm in it til $16/share.

418,BB,ntf8df,2021-06-06 08:16:40,$BB ideas for Monday,"Disclaimer: I got out from $BB on Friday.

$BB dropped below $14.30 (50% Fib Retracement mark). This mark was tested and rejected multiple time from Thursday through Friday. However at around 2pm $BB dropped bellow. Bulls immediately tried regaining this level but got rejected and we closed below. The next level is 61.8%, $13. Bulls must hold this one in my opinion. There's a big hole that is still unfilled when $BB gapped up from June 1st to 2nd. If $BB goes below $13, then we might retest June 1st closing of $11.56 and 78.6% retracement mark of $11.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/Pv2AQcyz/

Volume on Friday also wasn't great. Comparing it to Thursday is a bit unfair since that was a record breaking day. That being said, Friday volume was a half of what it was on Wednesday. This was also $BBs first negative day of this run. Looking back to January, first negative day of that run also coincided with lower volume and that was basically the end of that run. Volume was keep decreasing since that day going forward. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/onHdg7BE/

On Monday:

* If $BB opens above $14.30, it will most likely try and retest 50% retracement again. If we hold above, might be a good place to jump back in. 

* If $BB opens between $14.30 and $13, just wait and see, that's noman's land. If $BB starts to slide then I'm looking for a strong rejection at $13 before even thinking about jumping back in. If we go below $13, then there are good chances we'll retest $11.5 and $11 marks. If $BB starts the morning strong and goes up, watch what happens at $14.30. Going above and stabilizing that is a good sign. 
* And of course I'm looking for better volume than last Friday if there's to be continuation of this run.",DD,0.79

Are you enjoying a weekend of recovery from an unfortunate (read: 100% normal) week of buying high and selling low? WELL, same here. Now that I'm awake from that Friday night bender (it's Sunday?), I wanted to take a few minutes to do a couple of things....

1. TL;DR at the bottom, but I do hope you take a second to skim it
2. Review some analyst predictions and price targets on CLNE
3. Talk to you about CLNE short activity that has taken place over the last couple of days
4. Update the room on the status of market conditions surrounding CLNE and just some sentiment

If you want to learn more about CLNE, I've got a short DD post in my history from last week that you can check out; it's an easy read. Or, recommended, you can search for one of the more in depth DD's done here; all great work.

^(Disclaimers:) 

^(1. no images because auto-mod kept screwing me last time.  - 2. I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. - 3. 1,000 shares at <$8.25 average dating back to first purchase in 2020.  - 4. Thank you mom for turning my computer on and transcribing my incoherent mumbling into these words.)

# Let's start with a review of analyst price targets... CLNE closed Friday at $9.31

* 5 analysts have offered 12 month price targets on CLNE
* Low estimate is $11.00 (18.2% gain from Friday close)
* High estimate is $27.00 (190% gain from Friday close)
* Median estimate is $20.00 (114.8% gain from Friday close)
* **Cramer came out in May and said he doesn't like the stock**

""aNaLyStS aRe DuMb AnD Ur DuMb ToO"" - I know and I know. ""AnD aMaZoN iS GoNnA dIlUtE tHeM sHaReS bRuThUr!"" What? Ok..... **To quote Bill \[from science videos shown in elementary school class rooms whose last name happens to be the same as a small cap stock ticker\],** ***consider the following...***

* There's a legitimate case to be made for the stock having an extended-term floor of somewhere near $13.49, thanks to details of their partnership with little-known company called Amazon.
* As a part of the deal with Bezos Inc, which also supports 46 CLNE fueling stations, Amazon reserved the right to purchase up to 53 million shares on warrants at a strike price of $13.49.
* *However,* only a quarter of these are exercisable immediately. The rest are only vested after Jeff has made a certain amount of fuel purchases from CLNE. This drastically detracts from the cost of the deal, and the way CLNE runs those sales/revenues will most certainly be pumped back into additional infrastructure investment (see their earnings which are always dead on estimates and near $0.00 EPS)
* In short, Amazon has a huge stake pending in CLNE, but only after significant additional expenditure and investment. AKA..... *PARTNERSHIP*

# Moving on to the topic of... shorts and activity...

I'm not as fluent on this subject as I am some others like technical mumbo jumbo and early 2000's pop-punk/emo music (IT'S NOT A PHASE MOM), but I think you'll appreciate the information here and at least be able to connect the dots as to how this relates to the other popular stonk plays on this sub.

* Over the last 10 trading days, before Thursday/Friday, daily shares sold short sits at about 10% of volume.
* On Thursday this rose to 26.8% on the day - on Friday again to 32% on the day
* So what, 26 or 32% isn't huge, right? Sort of.
* The significance from the rise in ratio of shares sold short vs volume is the **concurrent spike in volume.... In terms of absolute numbers, shares sold short went from about 500,000 per day to 8.10 million on Thursday and 10.64 million on Friday.**
* The major short players on this stock have been Citadel and Blackstone.
* Spoiler alert.... **According to fintel, short shares availability is only 8.6 million as of June 4th.**
* With an average daily volume of around 5 million (again, before Thursday/Friday), how many days to cover....? You do the math.

# And some final thoughts about market conditions around CLNE and the options landscape...

I'm not here to push any squeeze thesis, just providing information to help you develop your own conclusions about what I believe to be a great stock play (I've been in since 2020). There is short and long term potential here, in my opinion.

* The \[now famous\] June 18th $13 strike call OI now sits at 29,544, an increase of about 25% since my last update and representing 2.95 million shares of exercisable calls. This is about 60% of the average daily volume prior to the spike in volume on Thursday/Friday.
* A reddit user, who I won't name because I haven't asked them, who used to work in IR at CLNE indicated to me during chat/discussion this weekend that the leadership team is aware of the recent uptick in interest/sentiment and are excited that people are not only interested in the company, but also believe in the product.
* The DD content and general sentiment on here the last couple of days, and months honestly, has been positive. The environmental side of the story is great. Besides needing a decent business case and technicals, never before in history (my opinion) has it been more important to have a good story/mission to make people feel good about what your company is doing. Our society is more social than ever.
* **üêÑüí®üöÄ** üåô

TL;DR

Do I think this is a one-way ticket to \[the planet\] Uranus? No. Do I think this will make me an overnight millionaire? No, especially because my position is relatively small. But, I do think that there is a legitimate shot at some gains both short and long term here. **The company has a product, sales, partnerships, a good story, and now the backing of an army of passionate people (read: apes) who, quite simply, like the stock.**

Thanks and take care.

In short, no.

SelfWealth members have been allowed to buy and sell GME as  well as others like AMC, throughout the entirety of 2021. This is in  stark comparison to other platforms that entirely halted the trading of  certain stocks.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME ‚Äì  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.¬† These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***",Discussion,0.88

428,UWMC,neetnp,2021-05-17 14:23:47,$200K all-in because I believe that $UWMC is undervalued. CEO agreed undervalued and declared a buyback to retire class A float (only class that gets dividends). BULLISH trend this week!," 

I  have shared my thoughts on UWMC in past. The company announced Q1  earnings and while they look like they are below expectations it was  explained by the CEO that because of the speed of their execution, their  results are reflective of the higher rate environment already while  competitors are lagged.

During    the Q4 2020 earnings call he  had mused about options that would be on    the stable, special dividend,  buyback or raising the dividend.

**Feb Q4 Earnings Quote:**

The     Board did approve a dividend, a $0.10 quarterly dividend to be  paid    on  April 6 for all shareholders of record as of March 10. **We expect  this to be a regular quarterly dividend**.

And     so you guys know how we're thinking about this. Our balance sheet   is  a   fortress. And our current liquidity position is very strong, and    we   have access to the capital markets as well. The way we think  about   this   going forward is we're producing a lot of cash. We're  going to   maybe   be more profitable than some expected and be very  successful in   2021.   And **if we have excess cash that I and the Board deem is too much,  we will be delivering that back**. And whether we have to **change     the  dividend in the future, as in raise it or a special dividend,     those  things are definitely on the table or even buying back shares**.

**May Q1 Earnings Quote:**

As     you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of      $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a      record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I always  **explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special  dividend or a share buyback program**. As you guys have seen, we **concluded      share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward   shareholders.    We announced the authorization of $300 million share   buyback over the    next 24 months**.  And **quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that**.

**Then in answering a question from an analyst**

Doug    Harter -  Great. And then just in terms of capital return, you    mentioned sort of  the float. I  guess just how are you thinking about    kind of **how much of  the float  you'd be willing to take out and pacing around share  repurchase**?

Mat Ishbia -  Yes, Doug. So I'm learning these rules as we go **because at this stock  price, I'm a buyer, right**?    And so we'll buy shares as soon as tomorrow, I  think, as our legal    teams say we're allowed to do. And so I don't know  how many I can buy    and what I can do, but I'm very conscientious of the  float.  If the    float was not a concern, **we'd be more aggressive**. However,  **we     have authorization from the Board to buy up to $300 million, and I'm      going to take advantage of that opportunity while being  conscientious     of our partners in the float.**

TL/DR:     UWMC and their board have been looking at ways to give back to     shareholders. Instead of a short term cash out, they decided on a     buyback that they are planning to exercise immediately on so that they     can retire shares while the SP is low. They will NOT buy so much that   it   will ruin their float % for Russell. The CEO is aggressive, has    approval to spend $300 and he's going to take FULL advantage.  The CEO has stated he is a BUYER! They are  not   waiting, it's being deployed now.

Disclosure I am still in long position with 25K  at 8.39 USD shares of UWMC

By now WWE should be on everyones tendie radar after today's outsized move on large volume (6x the normal daily volume). The combination of low float (\~44M), high short interest (18-22%) and the sheer number of extremely memeable wrastling GIFs set this one up to be one for the history books. The options chain is also primed to explode. I could easily see this running back to the old ATHs within the next few months.

On top of that we have the return of live events next month in Texas and potential buyout rumors floating around adding fuel to the fire. This summer is setting up to be big for McMahon and his merry crew of men in leotards, we should all profit from this greatly.

The assumption being made here is that the stock market will react to AMC, BB, and ASO short squeezes EXACTLY as it did to GME. A true apples to apples comparison of what has happened to GME being applied to our other favorites.

Up first is teaching you how to calculate earning in the form of a percentage. The formula goes like this. (Current Value - initial Cost)√∑initial cost x 100= percentage return. 

GmE started at roughly 18$ before it gained squeeze worthy traction and eventually topped out at $483. I chose 18$ as the starting point t because earning up until that point were smooth and slowly trending upwards on a 1 year chart. GmE has 70 Million Shares outstanding. It's 18 to 483 dollars increase gives it a return of 2,583% roughly.

Applying this to AMC goes like this. AMC had a ""pre-surge"" stable price of 10$. 10x25.83=258$ however GME only has 15 percent of the shares outstanding that AMC has so you have to consider the market Cap. $258x.15%= $38.70 expected squeeze price. All variables being the same at its highest AMC could go to $38.70 

BB is going  to be very similar to AMC because of a large market cap. BB ""pre-surge"" stable price is $10 as well, this is being generous because a good argument could be made to use $8-9 but I decided to use 10. So 10x25.83=$258 however GME only has 12% of shares outstanding as BB so that has to be factored in 258x .12%= $30.96  I believe at the height of any BB squeeze due to market cap the price could soar as high as $30 using GME variables.

Here is where things get interesting ASO has a ""pre-surge"" stable price of $30 and GME has 77% of shares outstanding compared to ASO, a Much higher variable, with a much higher starting price, and a higher short interest than BB & AMC. Here we go 30x25.83= 775$ 
775 x.77= $596 squeeze price potential

So in essence we can triple our money or better on AMC & BB depending on when you bought in. AsO has the potential to be HUUUGGEüöÄüöÄüíØüòÉ",DD,0.78

Given the short interest today (expected to be higher Monday), the Short sale restriction list, the massive amount of volume in last few days ( almost 200 million Thursday) , will the buying pressure lead to a considerable squeeze?


Black rock and other institutional investors have been increasing shares for the last couple of months. 

This has a relatively low float as compared to other successful shorts like AMC. Stocktwits watchers are growing like crazy. 

EV is having a big bull run this summer. And that‚Äôs not even mentioning all the political news .

440,BNGO,np937m,2021-05-31 19:48:39,BNGO Discounted Cash Flow Model,"https://preview.redd.it/ko3tmu2buh271.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=b152ff16064d6ce20439d94e448adac57d08878f

This my quick and top of the head version of DCF model for BNGO. Please note that I haven't made any pin-point assumptions. All assumptions are ballmark to just get an high level price estimate. I'm not a financial advisor nor a financial analyst. I'm just a random guy applying his financial education in real life.

I'm more than happy to hear your feedback and update my analysis with more accurate numbers or correct any wrong assumptions. Please let me know if I'm missing any other types of revenues/expenses. If you feel its justified, feel free to share it on other social media platforms! :)

Recently on SeekingAlpha, an analyst did his DCF model and his price came out to be $7.3 which I feel wasn't justified enough. I believe it was because he didn't factor in Saphyr 2.0 potential and didn't project his sales for longer years. Well, so I took it upon myself as a small little challenge to do a DCF myself.

NOTE: This does not include the Nanonozzle revenue projection because at this point in time, its really hard to estimate those numbers. Also just wanted to note that the top analysts on Tip Rank gave BNGO an average price target of $12. I think this sort of proves my analysis that BNGO is at least worth $12.

EDIT: I have received some critical feedback on my analysis from my post on BNGO subreddit. I will be incorporating those changes, but it will only affect my analysis positively.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*\*TLDR; #BNGO2THEMOON\*\*\*\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Units Installed:

Expected sales of Saphyr to increase about 80% every year as more and more labs/clinics/hospitals/etc start to adopt it. Though from year 2028+ I have reduced the adoption to 50% every year, giving me an almost 70% CAGR.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rent/Sold:

I have broken the sales of Saphyr into ‚Äúrent‚Äù and ‚Äúsold‚Äù. This is because there are different consumables agreement with each type of ‚Äúsale‚Äù. As per CFO in Q1 earnings transcript, he said rentals are more sales; however, this might change as Saphyr is still finding its level. My assumption is 60% rent and slowly reducing down to 35% by 2030+.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Revenue per Consumable:

We currently know it costs $550/consumable. As BNGO‚Äôs goal is to reduce it to $100, I have done about $50 decrement each year starting 2024 (when Saphyr 2.0 will launch) and achieving $100 from 2028+.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Saphyr 1.0/2.0:

Saphyr 1.0 is just 5000/14 rounding it down to 350 genomes per year. Why divide by 14? Because that‚Äôs what Saphyr 2.0 will be able to do.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Min 120 Genome per 6 month (Rent Agreement):

If someone rents from Saphyr, that‚Äôs what the agreement states currently. This means minimum 240genome runs at per Saphyr (rented ones) per consumable price every year. I‚Äôm assuming they are running the minimum and not the maximum capacity i.e, about 350/year.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sold Saphyr 240 Genome Bundle:

Currently BNGO has a bundle going out for clients who buy Saphyr. For them, the genome run would cost $450 instead of $550. However, for ease of calculation, I have not included the $100 discount in my calculation. Everything is being multiplied by consumable price for the year. I‚Äôm assuming they are running the minimum and not the maximum capacity i.e, about 350/year.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Saphyr 2.0 Consumables:

This was the trickiest part in my calculations and involves a lot of ‚Äúassuming stuff.‚Äù We all know they are aiming to launch 2.0 by 2024. Therefore, adoption of 2.0 will take time and as a result it will take some time for revenue to start increasing from 2.0. We also know it will be able to do 5000 genomes a year, but not every lab/clinic/hospital/etc will be running that much. So for my calculation I have assumed only 5% of 5000 genomes runs will be done on the Saphyrs installed everywhere. This will increase by 2.5% over the years up to 20% by 2030+. In terms of CAGR, it will be increasing by almost 180% every year. Given the power of Saphyr 2.0, I think its reasonable enough estimate. I also think this is somewhat conservative and the number will be even higher. My calculations are based on that only 25% of the full power of Saphyr 2.0 will be used. This section is debatable and I‚Äôm happy to talk more about it and update it with useful feedback.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Total Revenue:

Revenue growing at 79% CAGR. Again, this is a very conservative number from my perspective. Also, as per Eric (CEO), he expects the revenue to be somewhere between 2.6B ‚Äì 3.8B with 10,000 Saphyrs sold. In my calculation, we hit 10k mark in year 2029. We can see total revenue is around 2.3B, lower than Eric‚Äôs estimation. Though my consumables estimate is between his expectation. Its just the sale of Saphyr that seems to be off. I‚Äôm assuming 65% will be sales and 35% will be rent by 2029. Maybe more of sales and less of rent might be a better estimate??

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gross Margin:

Currently BNGO‚Äôs margin is around 33%. To be very conservative, I haven‚Äôt increased margin by a lot. I‚Äôm estimating margin to steadily grow throughout the years.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additional Costs:

This is any other costs over operating expenses, just being more conservative. I‚Äôm increasing it at a rate of 20-30% over the years at a 25% CAGR.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Net Profit/(Loss):

You can see BNGO will start to be profitable by year 2024. It will really start to pick up in net profits in year 2026+.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC):

Formula: Cost of Equity + Cost of Debt

Cost of Equity = Risk Free Rate + Beta\*(Market Rate ‚Äì Risk Free Rate)

Risk Free Rate = 10Yr Treasury Bond = 1.75%

Market Rate = 8%

Beta = 2

Cost of Debt = 0 (As BNGO rarely have any debt)

WACC = 14%

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Free Cash Flow:

Assumed Net Profits as a source of free cash flow available to the company.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Terminal Value:

Assumed a 3% industry average for BNGO. Although this is very unlikely because BNGO is far away from its maturity stage. But for ease of calculation purpose, BNGO will grow at 3% for the rest of its life.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Firm Value:

After discounting all the CFs for 10 years at 14%, it gives me the company value to be around 5.5B. This is about 3x the current market cap.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Outstanding Shares:

The current outstanding shares are 279M. For the sake of dilution articles out there, lets say BNGO raises extra $350M and lets say at $7 price, this would mean extra 50M shares. So, out outstanding would now be 329M.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Price per Share:

With the 5.5B MV and 279M O/S share, this gives me a share price of $20. This is about 3x the current share price. Giving a potential upside of about 200%. Even with the extra $350M offering, the price would fall to $16.7 per share.

Well, in any case, as per my assumptions in the discounted cashflow method, BNGO seems to be heavily discounted.",DD,0.92

A combination of **high short interest, low float, increasing call volume** and **volatility expansion** (leading to IV expansion) will force Market Makers to delta and gamma hedge and shorts to capitulate themselves into a death spiral.

**All signals are GO. It's a fucknado powder keg about to explode.**

The IV expansion of all existing strikes will cause MMs to overhedge, **making the options market weigh more on the underlying market**, and as strikes become in the money the price action becomes a self-perpetuating feedback loop. In fact, Market Makers tend to LEAVE after meme-ification of a stock, **decreasing the float even more, destabilizing price resistance** while demand skyrockets.

The ultimate reason why this is a great fundamental play? **It's not even a shitty MEME company**. It has great fundamentals and is one of the greatest beneficiaries of our inflationary environment-- **the steel shortage is a powerful macro trend** that's increasing the cash flows and fundamental value of the company, and the leadership is one that will use this macro trend to reinvest, balance their balance sheets, and prime themselves to increase their dominance in the iron/steel industries.

**TL:DR: My Thesis**

I think Netflix was secretly trying to drive these companies into the ground and hold their heads underwater with their hedgy henchmen. Their plan was within sight with the Lockdowns as both companies were hit hard. They were very close and slotted for BlockBusters fate until **we stepped in and fucked it up**. With everyone straped into their couches this last year binging tiger king how do you increase revenue? They've been trading sidways ever since. Now Netflix is fucked. The release of Cuties shot themselves in the foot (lost 800,000) viewers at such a competitive time in the streaming sector.

Karma's a bitch, just like my stepmom: Netflix has it coming, and that's why I'm not very tall and I hear they have hedges in between the Eiffel tower. *yeah you like that?*

Theres a bunch of reasons! The ceo has worked Mars Bars, Kellogg, and coor beer (which means hes well aware of distribution of products and marketing). 

They have one billion on hand and 0 debt. 

Their products are clean and modern, its the Apple products of marijuana from the looks of it. 

They just announced a joint venture which is seeking international opportunities. 

They are also one of the most heavily shorted stocks too,  which is what caused GME to explode. 

Cannabis is also legalized in canada and mexico now, so The united states is now pinched between two major cannabis producers. 

They recovered from a huge debt and are now positive in earnings for the first time ever. 

They‚Äôre the only cannabis company with 0 debt, positive investment returns, and they‚Äôre focusing on internal cultivation to maximize profit margins. 

Most of the other companies shifted away from internal cultivation and are buying marijuana as whole sale. 

They‚Äôve also recently acquired two other dispensary companies. 

Amazon also just backed marijuana legalization. 

Legalizing marijuana would also make the weed sector go crazy. Joe biden also plans on decriminalizing marijuana! 

SNDl now has steady growth upwards.

473,DD,nthp3b,2021-06-06 11:11:28,"DD RNG potential if compared with Hydrogen &amp; BEVs, USA (California) regulatory and legislative focus","Hello everyone, 

here a DD focused on RNG and Natural Gas developments in the USA, as previous one was more broad and had the intention to outline the state of the industry worldwide.

As you may know, California has always been at the center of attention as the most advanced state in terms of decarbonization efforts. Yet, it seems that not all decisions paid back in terms of quality of life and certainty of business activity.

**Californian** **Natural Gas power plants shut down, electricity imported from other states:**

Indeed, California, different from what someone would expect, has not a good and reliable supply of electricity, probably because it pushed too aggressively for the state's 100% electrification goal (see attached picture). During the most recent blackout in August 2020, some Electric buses were forced to shut down, in order to reduce electricity demand. In the next decade, virtual power plants' alike experiments will be more popular, therefore it is reasonable to expect a better match between the demand & supply of green electricity. But it will take time and for safety reasons, it would be better to rely on different sources of energy.

* [2020-08-21 Washington Examiner: California forced to defend green goals amid blackouts](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/california-forced-to-defend-green-goals-amid-blackouts)
* [2020-08-23 Oil & Gas 360 : Green California has the nation's worst power grid](https://www.oilandgas360.com/green-california-has-the-nations-worst-power-grid/)

The first question that arises, reading these topics, is about the never-ending announcements of companies like Nikola $NKLA (very dubious business potential) and Tesla $TSLA (amazing company with incredible potential) about the incoming, quick and easy electrification of Heavy Duty Transports.

**Hydrogen Alternative Focus**

Nikola revealed its lack of technological breakthrough when it was revealed that General Motors had the intention to market a Hydrogen trucks with the Nikola brand and...... GM Fuel Cells!! The drama related to the CEO trials made the rest. I am a huge fan of hydrogen , but as Cummins $CMI CEO confirmed, hydrogen trucks have a long long way to go before being adopted on a large scale (please note that [Cummins acquired Hydrogenics in Sept. 2019](https://www.cummins.com/news/releases/2019/09/09/cummins-closes-its-acquisition-hydrogenics) (second global leader after $BLDP in hydrogen fuel cells). According to Cummins and others, in the next years electrolyzer segment will grow first. Note that the hydrogen fuel needed for hypothetical trucks on California's road would need green hydrogen, thus it will put more stress on the grid.. Even if it is not focused on the US, I recommend readers this report of David Fickling about global green hydrogen potential by 2050. 

[According to David Fickling](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/the-hydrogen-economys-time-is-approaching/2020/05/08/383b1a04-9191-11ea-9322-a29e75effc93_story.html), hydrogen could meet 24% of the world‚Äôs energy needs by 2050, but it would likely take 31‚Äô320 TWh of electricity to hit this level. Last year, the entire world generated just roughly 26‚Äô000 TWh, of which 10‚Äô000 were coming from zero-carbon sources. By 2050 it may be achievable, but there are shorter deadlines for the transport sector. Actions today are required to match 2025 and 2030 emission targets.

If we want a high percentage of **green hydrogen**, a huge amount of grid investments is required today; high-tension grid infrastructure needs 5-10 years to be completed, therefore it is reasonable to say that hydrogen will be a sound reality for mobility from the late 2020‚Äôs on, not earlier. In addition, the potential of exhausted salt mines that could store hydrogen for months is just theoretical for now.

It is worth to remember that the sources for electricity generation in Europe are diversified and are not ready for a 100% renewable energy scenario:

* **Germany renounced to nuclear power** in 2011 and will renounce to coal by 2030, and the country is massively investing in gas pipelines, so it is very likely that it will not renounce to Russian gas.
* **France relies heavily on nuclear power**, with some of these power plants being soon too old to remain active. Therefore, traditional gas generation will be a ¬†likely alternative to overcome this problem.
* **The UK closed all its coal power plants** but decided to keep open nuclear and gas facilities.
* **Italy** relies heavily on gas and does not have any nuclear power plant.

None of Europe‚Äôs largest countries can afford a 100% green electricity sector that can satisfy both current demand plus the incremental demand coming from the green hydrogen sector. Therefore, some fossil fuel (natural gas) and nuclear plants are here to stay for the longer term.

**BLUE HYDROGEN CANNOT BE IGNORED -** The argument is different if we include in the discussion blue hydrogen along with carbon capture. In this scenario, we would need massive incentives and research investments in carbon capture technology, which now are still at an early stage. According to the European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen, [who spoke at the World Economic Forum in January 2020](https://www.ft.com/content/c93694c8-3d15-11ea-a01a-bae547046735), the EU will define the structure of a continental carbon tax by the end of this year (pre-COVID-19 intention, very likely now that the details will be published in 2021). For this reason, large trade partners like the US and China were advised to start their own studies on the tax, if they do not want their goods to be taxed at the highest possible carbon emission rate.

**HYDROGEN TRAIN FOCUS**¬†\- An interesting case in this regard is the Hydrogen train developed by Alstom and Hydrogenics (now Cummins Inc.) whose adoption has been delayed considerably. Alstom was able to sell its innovative product to some German and French regions. Nevertheless, in most of the cases hydrogen will come from fossil sources (Rhyne region etc.), with cleaner alternatives being provided at a later stage. In the region of Schleswig Holstein, where the green potential was massive, Alstom could have got the greatest commercial order for a hydrogen product worldwide; however, the green fueling station was at the heart of a controversy between the company and the tender offer authorities of Schleswig-Holstein. For this reason, 52 trains were allocated to the battery train manufacturer and the Alstom (Hydrogenics) & NEL consortium lost the tender offer. The proposed fueling station was massive for the time, being around 20 MW capacity, [but the cost of it was at the expense of the consortium](https://www.ln-online.de/Lokales/Lauenburg/Aus-fuer-die-Wasserstoffzelle-auf-der-Schiene).

**BEV Infrastructure focus**

Tesla instead kept postponing the launch of its Tesla SEMI. You can read again the last conference call transcripts which clearly states that the biggest issue from a product perspective is the fast charger technology, whose time of realization and commercialization is yet unknown. From a macro perspective instead is unclear how California may afford to charge thousands of Tesla SEMI with its current electricity grid.

**How does $CLNE fits into all this?**

 If you look at 2020 Q2 CC of $CLNE , management made a quite useful comparison for H2 fueling stations and BEV charging stations for heavy-duty. They told the story of a recharging facility in Los Angeles that was going to be built for $5.5 million to recharge 24 heavy-duty trucks in a day‚Äôs time, in like 20-hour time, using the equivalent of the electricity needed for 44‚Äô000 homes (!!!). Thus, it is reasonable to expect not many fleet operators to switch soon to BEV trucks.¬†

About hydrogen refueling, management commented on the experience they got operating a hydrogen station in California with on-site hydrogen generation through electrolysis:

‚Äú*Get a load of this, it requires about 20 gallons of water (each gallon is 3.785 liters) for every gallon of hydrogen you produce. So march that out on a nationwide scale. And the idea that we're going to do it with renewable sources at a station is going to be very daunting, okay?*

*I think that as you look at commercial truck stops with hydrogen, you're probably looking at something on the order of $15 million to $20 million, or more, per station. So this is a very expensive proposition because you're basically creating a whole new network. And really, the most successful stations around the world, and there's only a handful of hydrogen, is you're reforming natural gas.‚Äù*

It is clear why some fleet operators are switching to Natural Gas Trucks. Amazon in February and the Port of LA recently, with the decision to equate BEV and other Zero Emission trucks to the Natural Gas ones. 

**US Congress ""Californification"" , not so fast**

In the past legislative period, there were some bipartisan attempts to support RNG and Natural Gas mobility. US Congress has indeed shown some interest in the subject. Last June, a bipartisan effort was introduced in both the chambers of the US congress. The bill is called ‚Äú[Growing Climate Solutions Act](https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/09/10/growing-climate-solutions-act-gives-farmers-a-seat-at-the-carbon-market-table/)‚Äù and would allow farmers to generate revenue streams from different forms of carbon capture. Most notably, methane from livestock is mentioned in the legislation. If enacted at ¬†the federal level, decarbonized gas would receive a renovated interest from many different stakeholders. [Being a bipartisan deal](https://www.audubon.org/news/indiana-senator-mike-braun-discusses-bipartisan-climate-solutions-young-leaders), as farmers represent a prized electoral category, it should be enacted regardless of the next election results.

President Biden needs to show to his party and the American people that he is doing something about the environment. That is why he advertised the Ford BEV pickup and keeps saying that government's fleets will be electrified. As always, the political reality is much more complex than the headline announcements, and RNG has a lot of room to grow in this space. 

[Already in 2020, RNG represented 53% of all Natural Gas used in transport in the USA](https://bioenergyinternational.com/markets-finance/rng-surpassed-ng-accounting-for-53-percent-of-us-on-road-ngv-fuel-use-in-2020) . As noted in a previous DD, in California RNG is 90% of NG used in transport.

Let me know if you have further questions!

While I'm still not 100% certain on the longevity of the company yet until I see more progress, short term I think this thing has plenty of room to run in the current market. Also, this bad boy has seen numbers like $40+ and I'm confident if momentum picks back up this thing can get back up to the $20+ range.

There is information going around the $WKHS owns 10% of $RIDE and that $WKHS should go down with it as well. Initially, I thought the same thing until I did a little more research and found out that $WKHS owns part of $RIDE through a licensing deal where $RIDE paid $WKHS $12 million dollars in exchange for intellectual property and 10% stake in their company. This isn't something that $WKHS paid cash for, its basically free stake in that company.

However this is straight from the horses mouth from a Ford Dealership in Canada. They clearly state and clarify this partnership directly on their dealership website. Information I have just come across today.

[https://www.rivercityford.ca/xl-hybrids/](https://www.rivercityford.ca/xl-hybrids/)

What's more is in their latest today that have opened a new Centre in MI today again stating that it's where Ford and GM cars will become electrified.

[https://twitter.com/xlfleet/status/1402634437083471883?s=21](https://twitter.com/xlfleet/status/1402634437083471883?s=21)

I've been watching the level 2 for days and every time volume dries up it's being accumulating. In my opinion they are simply messing with the price.

If you want to read their investors presentation see below.

[https://xlfleet.com/assets/Uploads/PDF/Updated-Investor-Presentation-9.21.20.pdf](https://xlfleet.com/assets/Uploads/PDF/Updated-Investor-Presentation-9.21.20.pdf)

What a lot of people are missing about $XL is they have fingers in every sector of the EV market. 

They have substantial cash reserves of $400,000,000 roughly 1/3 of their market cap so there is no immediate requirement for cash.

**Please read full DD bullet points below:**

**Basic Stats:**

Market Cap: $1b

Public Float 94.4m

Shares Short: 22.11M

Share Float Short: 23.3%

32 days of consolidation at lows meaning an extremely strong base has been put in at this price. Everybody has been shorting during this period is now trapped.

Vanguard loaded up 6,000,000 extra shares with some other funds increasing their positions.

Possible entry into the Russel Index which would see far more cash flow into the name.

On the 26th March 2021 a total of 205,641 shares were awarded to employees at an estimated cost price of $6.81; With a one year lock up. Giving them a massive incentive to hit targets.

XL recently bought WEES in a 50/50 cash and stock deal which again in my opinion is a great buy. World Energy generated $18 million in total revenue and was free cash flow positive for full year 2020. Its acquisition, which closed Monday, is expected to expand XL Fleet‚Äôs electric vehicle charging infrastructure capabilities, the company said

XL recently inked a deal with UBS arena to provide charging stations, solar generation and energy storage. For a total of 1,000 charging stations which is one of the largest deployments in the United States.

The company they inked the deal with also owns another 30 properties. Meaning more contracts is a very likely outcome.

They also announced that to cover their current clients who consist of names like Fedex, Coca Cola, Pepsi etc they would need to install over 100,000 charging stations making them the biggest player in the industry.

100's of millions sitting in cash

Finally a Short Float of 23.3% approx 22,000,000 shares short. For a comparison this is more than $AMC and $BB.

The market cap and share float are so small that the room for an explosive move is enormous.

I'm personally looking for a minimum of Shitrons target at $60 a share and based on current future projections

I want to share what I think is lining up to be the next CLOV... 

Still largely under the radar is Vancouver based WELL Health Technologies (TSX:WELL) which also has significant short interest, strong fundamentals , and billionaire backers. They just completed a $206M acquisition of ‚ÄúMyHealth‚Äù now making it the largest private clinic operator in Canada.

Just prior to that, the company recently announced the $372.9M Acquisition of CRH medical which significantly increased WELLs footprint in the US... This is where it gets interesting. Not only did JP Morgan extend there existing credit line to CRH medical by USD$100M to $300M and RBC provide a C$200M secured credit facility for the recent ‚ÄúMyHealth‚Äù acquisition.¬†

But the company legit partnered with Fenwick & West to assist with a NASDAQ IPO in Q4 of this year.... Fenwick client base is Facebook, Amazon, Cisco, and recently COIN... We are on a launch pad waiting to take off. 

Jumping into the charts now... WELL has consolidated for a year while they have exponentially grown the fundamentals of the business. Just recently they blew through every moving average.

2. The FED doesnt raise rates, and lets inflation (and later hyperinflation) eat away at the dollar. This would also make the bonds worth less, as theyd have to lower the price to compensate for the interest being worth nothing. In this situation, the fed would be the only one willing to hold government bonds which would worsen the inflation as they effectively dont get payed interest on it.

Option one, the government goes bankrupt due to interests being to high to pay back. Option two, the public goes bankrupt due to hyperinflation.

Either way, a short position would profit in this trade.

I am not as rich as others here, but I bought stock worth 25k  to help and hopefully make a nice profit. cheers guys, may we all become  rich!   


My guess is we will see a blow-off top at around 420.69 per share, because at this price, the short squeeze will have happend (it has not happened yet). At least for me, this is where I will take around 50% profit.  


Here is proof of my position, I am from switzerland, that's why everything is in CHF. 587 shares, and I might buy more:

But honestly, once the shorts have to close their shorts, this is gonna explode like crazy.

From Tuesday, January 26th's close to Wednesday, January 27th's high, for GME, we saw an increase of 156%  


From yesterday's close to today's high, for AMC, we saw an increase of 126%   


GME has set the tone to what we're able to accomplish if we all stick together and just hold!   


Now let's forget what happened after January 27th on GME...  


GME has set the tone on what we are able to accomplish when we all come together and hold!  


This has been one hell of a week thus far and I firmly believe AMC, GME, all other meme stocks and rest of the heavily shorted stocks are only just getting started! You be the judge of it.
