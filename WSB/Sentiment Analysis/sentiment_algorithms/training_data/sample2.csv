Those include multi-factor authentication, endpoint detection and response, encryption and hiring a skilled security team. 🚀

The White House is warning businesses to take critical security measures to protect against ransomware, as hackers change their tactics from stealing data to disrupting critical infrastructure. 🚀

The open letter came after a string of ransomware attacks that stopped fuel from flowing up the East Coast and closed off beef and pork production from one of the U.S.A's leading food suppliers. There was 65,000 successful ransomware attacks last year, according to statistics. 🚀

“Much as our homes have locks and alarm systems and our office buildings have guards and security to meet the threat of theft, we urge you to take ransomware seriously and ensure your corporate cybersecurity match the threat,” Ms. Neuberger wrote. 🚀

BlackBerry Guard is a product that offers all of the above mentioned and is available for implementation. It utilizes Cylance for AI cybersecurity platform paired with managed and detection response with 24/7 support from incident responders and prevention experts. Products that they have available for implementation are BlackBerry Spark Unified Endpoint Security (UES) Suite,  BlackBerry Spark Unified Endpoint  Management (UEM) Suite and  Mobile Content Management (MCM). 🚀

TL;DR  Not one BlackBerry Guard customer was affected by the SolarWindsHack. 🚀🚀🚀

1,CRSR,nrldny,2021-06-03 21:13:55,CRSR about to break through its 3 month sideways cycle. A value-loaded rocket waiting for a little more retail volume to pop.,"bla bla apes bla bla stupid idiots bla bla not financial advice bla bla intro meme

Real talk, I'd like to reintroduce you to the deep value gaming market stock the world seems to have forgot about (something institutional bears & short sellers have taken full advantage of...and I will explain why)

I've been bleeding out on FDs in sideways trading hell on this for too many months and its about time everybody opens their eyes to the reality this play...and start reaping the inevitable rewards.

In the shadow of the $AMC mega-gains, you might overlook $CRSR's respectable 7% lift this week.  But this movement is actually the sign of a fuse thats just been lit.

I shouldn't have to give most of you too much introduction on the company itself. Corsair was founded in 1994, and has since become one of the global leaders in PC gaming hardware and peripherals.  The company IPO'd last September at \~$15 and made a heroic run up to almost $51 before retreating into a seemingly never-ending sideways cycle. 

The company is 100% legit, it has a proven track record in an exploding industry. Yet…it’s been almost completely overlooked for sexier tech plays. And the institutional bears have been taking full advantage of that. 

This stock is a red-hot ember being pissed on by bears artificially holding the price down, just waiting for kindling to light. That kindling is volume. When it makes a run, it is going to double  almost instantly. 

# Rockstar Fundamentals

Whether you care about the F-word or not, Corsair has been an incredible buy opportunity. Even before the pandemic their revenues and profits were growing.

CRSR is on track to exceed $2bln revenue this year, more than doubling 2019 sales.  Profitability margins have been increasing every year since IPO

They have plenty of cash in the tank, and have been paying down debts. Its held 5% by Insiders, and a whopping 77% by institutional investors.

&#x200B;

The company isn't a one-trick pony. Aside from dominating some hardware sectors like Memory, Corsair has been making strategic acquisitions in the streaming space (most notably scooping up Elgato.)

By all accounts, Corsair is making all the right moves and is currently firmly in undervalued territory.

# Months of sideways strangulation by FUD-bears and Shorts.

$CRSR investors have endured many months of maddening sideways trading. For the first few months it seemed like it was trading with the market...and that investors were just waiting to see what happened with some upcoming news.

But after releasing good news after good news, the stock has continued to stagnate, and bounce around in completely unnatural intraday boom/bust cycles. Almost on queue swinging -2% to +2% to -2%  every day.

The reason for this is due to a mix of a very **low float and ridiculously low volume.** These two factors have allowed swing traders and institutional short sellers to play this stock like a fiddle.

CRSR has just **92 M** shares outstanding, and  **26.51M** shares in the float.  Most of the shares are held by institutions.

Short interest has been hovering around 20%. Which is high on its own...but doesn't tell the full story. Big pocket institutions have been selling tens of thousands of shares short in the AM, then covering intraday.

With the low volume, it doesn't take much to push the price down substantially without much ammo.

The big boys have been writing calls / buying puts, and then using shorts and their own holdings to push  the price down before exercise.

Meanwhile, bears have been spreading FUD throughout the investment world about CRSR on 3 primary points. None of which have actually come to fruition.

1. **CRSR is a ""Pandemic Play"", and gaming will magically disappear after things return to normal.**   This is the biggest boomer bs. The pc gaming and esports industries have been absolutely exploding over the last few years. Not to mention the streaming space which has been growing independently of it.  CRSR sales are cyclical like every retail company, but Q1 sales showed no signs of slowing.   Gaming is not going anywhere.
2. **THE SPOOOOKY Lockup period will cause millions of shares to flood the market.** There was tons of FUD spreading about 14 million IPO shares that would become unrestricted for sale back in March. People were convinced that these shares would flood the market instantly and tank the price.  But the lockup period came and went, almost no shares were actually sold.
3. **The global supply chain shortages means CRSR will not be able to grow.**  True, the microchip shortage is a threat to CRSR, but its also a threat to every other company in that space. What they've announced in their reports is that they had MORE DEMAND THAN THEY COULD FULFILL. That is not a bearish signal.  Despite the supply chain woes, CRSR sales dramatically beat expectations...showing they adapted and overcame this issue.

You may also be interested that the latest to join the short party is our good friends at Shita-del, making a short play at the end of May.

# The 59% Earning Beat everybody ignored

While some were expecting lackluster Q1 21 results as the pandemic wanes and supply chain issues rage on, in the May 2021 earnings release CRSR subverted all expectations. They beat estimates by an incredible 59%.  If anybody needed proof positive CRSR could weather the FUD, this was it.

But despite the stellar report, the stock actually DROPPED on the earnings report, and never recovered.

You might be saying ""of course the stock dropped, every tech stock drops on earnings"". Yes, this is true, IF there is a runup in the share price before the announcement. But in this case, there was no runup...the stock had been stagnant and even declining before the announcement.

This is when every retail CRSR holder knew this stock was not making natural movements, it was being intentionally held down.

By every logical account, the stock should have lifted in the weeks following the Q1 results. And because it didn't, the market has been ignoring CRSR due to the very effective FUD campaigns and short seller.

But this also means that the stock has entered deep into undervalued territory.

# LOW FLOAT VOLUME ROCKET

Given all the drama, why should you be looking at this stock? Because the same factors that bears have been using to hold this stock down are exactly what will cause it to take off.

**ALL $CRSR NEEDS TO BLOW IS A LITTLE MORE VOLUME**

The big bears have written calls and puts stacked around the $30-$35 strikes out through the EOY

https://preview.redd.it/t0ujqgdnn3371.png?width=973&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a506a07911ed26f5cbef6624b56a4717068089c

As soon as there is enough positive momentum on this thing from retail, the bearish trading strategies will become ineffective. They will lose a ton of money.

# Breaking Out

CRSR just hit $35/shr today for the first time since early March. This might not seem like much, but its the spark we needed.

I will reiterate, all this stock needs to pop is slightly more positive volume. This stock is poised to blow up fast and hard.  The float is too small, the short-selling tactics will not work when this thing makes a run.

At the moment it can be moved with only about 50k shares volume....averaging under 2 million total volume per day. If the volume increases >2 million or so in a multi day period, its going to run.

As CRSR continues its exceptional performance, it's only a matter of time before it breaks free from the cycle, and it looks like it will happen sooner than later. When it does happen....the shorts will crumble.

\*\*TL;DR\*\* A few thousand more people buy $CRSR the rocket gonna go Pop

FUBO was caught in the Archegos drama and has had their SP literally crushed in the past few weeks.

Before the HwangBang there was a reporting error that sent the SP dropping into Gulag. The previous report didnt factor in GAAP and also did not take into account dilution, resulting in a dramatically high EPS miss. Even with massive sub growth larger than ROKU and NFLX they got their shit kicked in.

Now, the company has been in a ""quiet period"" for weeks, meaning they cannot comment on anything regarding acquisitions or any material information until the period is over per SEC rules.

That period ends in 45 mins.

FUBO is the number 1 sports streaming platform, and is rolling out sports betting in Q4, and has the most impressive sub growth of all streaming services % wise. Theyre introducing original content to offer alongside Live TV.

ALL analysts covering the stock are projecting $40-$60 and institutional buying is the highest ive ever seen in the last 2 months on any stock.

&#x200B;

Theyre presenting at the Annual Needham Virtual Growth Conference on 5/17. Theyre edge over DKNG is that they can legally share all analytics they collect via their betting platform, which DKNG cannot do via privacy laws since theyre technically a 3rd party, whereas FUBO does it in house.

In this the short seller allegations against Clover Many say it has the potential to 2x in the next few weeks, but does it? Is Clover Health Stock still a Buy?! Clover's high membership growth, short seller Hindenburg's accusations, the competition with United Health (UNH), the opportunity in the online health industry,  Clover uses a software, named clover assistance, that improves every interaction at the point of care with machine learning. Physicians currently use clover assistants to help them deliver better care to patients, which gives better outcomes to patients and physicians as well. The company currently manages Medicare advantage plans and receives roughly $10,000 in annual revenue per patient. 

Few weeks ago, Hindenburg, the famous short seller, accused Chamath, the “king of spacs”, of luring retail investors through CLOV. This instantly caused the stock to drop. We saw a pop when Clover and Chamath responded to this attack. CLOV took this attack in an opportunity to make investors know them better. Between both CLOV and Chamath, they responded to the claims point by point and even provided more information. Altogether, it shows that Clover has nothing to hide. Chamath is known for finding growth opportunities and has helped many great companies go public such as Virgin Galactic. Chamath has a reputation to keep up so I don’t think we would jeopardize that with a bad investment. This is not a DD do your own and this is straight up plagiarized information.

NOTE: FDA has not approved the 180 day device yet, so when approval comes the price can be pushed much higher!

Study results:

* Overall mean absolute relative difference (MARD) against reference value was 9.1% for the primary sensor over 49,000 paired points and 8.5% for the SBA sensor over 12,000 paired points.
* The percent sensor readings within 20 mg/dL or 20% of reference values (20/20% agreement rate) were as follows:
   * Across the full 40-400 mg/dL range, the agreement rate was 92.9% for the primary sensor and 93.9% for the SBA sensor.
   * In the hypoglycemic ranges of 40-60 mg/dL and 61-80 mg/dL, the agreement rates were 89.4% and 92.2% for the primary sensor and 96.5% and 96.8% for the SBA sensor, respectively.
* Confirmed hypoglycemic alert detection rate was 93% for primary sensor and 94% for the SBA sensor.
* There were no related serious adverse events, all sensors were removed during the initial removal procedure and 1.1% of patients had a mild infection at the procedure site.

“We are very pleased with the results of the PROMISE Study which demonstrate an excellent safety and accuracy profile for the 180-day sensor. This study was initiated December 2018 and we’re very grateful to the tireless Clinical Investigators and the devoted study subjects for participating in this important clinical trial,” said Tim Goodnow, PhD, President and CEO of Senseonics. “As we await hearing from the US and European regulatory agencies concerning our pre-market submissions of data from both the primary and the SBA sensors, we are pleased to continue to offer the Eversense CGM systems in both the US and Europe with our commercialization partner, Ascensia Diabetes Care.”

A lot has happened in the lithium world in the past few months. I am going to try to summarize why I’m bullish on Lithium of Americas (NYSE: LAC) [https://www.lithiumamericas.com/](https://www.lithiumamericas.com/). There are a lot of positive points, but also risky ones; but scared money does not make money.

Lithium of Americas is a junior company that is currently developing “two world-class lithium projects”:

\- **Thacker Pass Project in Nevada** (100% owned)

It is the largest known lithium deposit in the United States with probable reserves of 3,1Mt of lithium carbonate equivalent. [https://www.mining-technology.com/features/top-ten-biggest-lithium-mines/](https://www.mining-technology.com/features/top-ten-biggest-lithium-mines/) 

\- **Cauchari-Olaroz in Argentina** (49% owned)

LAC is currently developing this project jointly with Ganfeng Lithium and the site contains and estimated amount of 3.6Mt of lithium carbonate equivalent. [https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/projects/cauchari-olaroz-lithium-project/](https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/projects/cauchari-olaroz-lithium-project/) 

Both sites have an estimated lifespan of about 40 years.

For information, the stock went from $2.14 at the start of the pandemic to $28.75 in January 2021 and is currently sitting at $15.30.

As you know, due to environmental concerns, EV are starting to weight more and more in the eye of the consumers (hello Nio and Tesla stocks in 2020). Thus, some countries and states are announcing the end of petrol and diesel cars. For example:

\- **UK** will ban petrol and diesel cars by 2030. [https://thedriven.io/2020/09/22/uk-to-accelerate-ban-on-petrol-and-diesel-vehicle-sales-to-2030/](https://thedriven.io/2020/09/22/uk-to-accelerate-ban-on-petrol-and-diesel-vehicle-sales-to-2030/) 

\- **Norway** will ban petrol and diesel cars by 2030. [https://www.fleeteurope.com/fr/safety//article/norway-ban-new-fossil-fuel-cars-2025?a=FJA05&t%5B0%5D=Tesla&t%5B1%5D=CO2&t%5B2%5D=Fuel&curl=1#:\~:text=From%202025%2C%20it%20will%20be,agreement%20on%20this%20radical%20measure](https://www.fleeteurope.com/fr/safety/article/norway-ban-new-fossil-fuel-cars-2025?a=FJA05&t%5B0%5D=Tesla&t%5B1%5D=CO2&t%5B2%5D=Fuel&curl=1#:~:text=From%202025%2C%20it%20will%20be,agreement%20on%20this%20radical%20measure). 

I will not list every country that is aiming at banning fossil fuel cars from their roads; the list would be too long. But as you can see, more and more are willing to reach this goal.

Furthermore, more and more historic car makers are starting to look in this direction, competing with newcomers. For example:

\- **Hyundai** is aiming at reducing its production of petrol and diesel cars by 50% and only sell EV by 2040. [https://trak.in/tags/business/2021/05/29/hyundai-reduces-production-of-petrol-diesel-cars-by-50-aims-to-sell-10-lakh-electric-cars/](https://trak.in/tags/business/2021/05/29/hyundai-reduces-production-of-petrol-diesel-cars-by-50-aims-to-sell-10-lakh-electric-cars/) 

\- **Ford** is anticipating that EV (in general) will represent 40% of vehicles by 2030 and the company will invest 30 billion in the next 4 years in this segment. [https://edition.cnn.com/2021/05/26/investing/ford-electric-vehicle-investment/index.html](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/05/26/investing/ford-electric-vehicle-investment/index.html) 

All of these points have a common denominator: batteries. EV currently need lithium (among other things) for the battery (about 10kg/22 pounds each). [https://www.barrons.com/articles/new-risk-tesla-other-electric-vehicle-makers-lithium-supply-batteries-51601498472](https://www.barrons.com/articles/new-risk-tesla-other-electric-vehicle-makers-lithium-supply-batteries-51601498472).

Furthermore, vehicles sales are estimated to reach 117 million units worldwide. I know it’s a quick and maybe too easy solution, but it can give an estimate: if we combine this with the estimation of Ford (40% EV in 2030), EV will represent 47 million vehicles, thus 470’000t of lithium will be required. In 2019. Worldwide lithium production in 2019 amounted to 77’000Mt ([https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2020/mcs2020-lithium.pdf](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2020/mcs2020-lithium.pdf)); production will need to be multiplied by 6 to reach the desired amount to build enough batteries for EV.

I am betting the increased demand for lithium will drive the price higher than it ever was. The latter is slowly recovering and gradually increasing ([https://www.fastmarkets.com/commodities/industrial-minerals/lithium-price-spotlight](https://www.fastmarkets.com/commodities/industrial-minerals/lithium-price-spotlight)).

https://preview.redd.it/ok9mjmvyx9271.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d131d2f9fda983f372361158ae8431f2c6015c0

Unlike Piedmont Lithium who already signed a contract with Tesla, LAC has not. If the lithium price continues to increase, the longer they wait, the higher their asking price will be and the higher their revenue will be.

Costs of extractions are estimated to be <$4’000/t at their future facilities in Nevada and Argentina and the lithium carbonate price is currently sitting at about $12’000/t. If the price continues to increase, we can clearly see that their profits will skyrockets… ([https://www.lithiumamericas.com/thacker-pass/](https://www.lithiumamericas.com/thacker-pass/)).

Furthermore, LAC received in January 2021 from the Bureau of Land Management the **approval** of the Thacker Pass Lithium Mine ([https://eplanning.blm.gov/public\_projects/1503166/200352542/20033308/250039507/Thacker\_Pass\_Project\_ROD\_signed\_2021-01-15.pdf](https://eplanning.blm.gov/public_projects/1503166/200352542/20033308/250039507/Thacker_Pass_Project_ROD_signed_2021-01-15.pdf))
A few more autorisations are expected to be delivered late summer (water, air quality,...) 

Joe Biden is also defending its **$174 billion** proposal to support the transition to electric vehicles. [https://robbreport.com/motors/cars/president-biden-174-billion-electric-cars-1234604827/](https://robbreport.com/motors/cars/president-biden-174-billion-electric-cars-1234604827/) 

Now, unto the risks:

As soon as LAC received the approval, some people filed a lawsuit ([https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bartell\_BLM\_COMPLAINT.pdf](https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bartell_BLM_COMPLAINT.pdf)) against the Bureau of Land Management, alleging that environmental impacts (on groundwater for example) were downplayed.

Two administration officials told Reuter a few days ago that “Biden will rely on ally countries to supply the bulk of metals needed to build electric vehicles and focus on processing them domestically into battery parts” ([https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/biden-looks-abroad-electric-vehicle-metals-blow-us-miners-2021-05-25/](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/biden-looks-abroad-electric-vehicle-metals-blow-us-miners-2021-05-25/)). This could be a threat to US miners, but LAC already received the approval (the project is still on hold due to the lawsuit).

In my mind, the positive outweighs the negative, but it’s still a risky investment and I believe in LAC.

Feel free to add anything that I might have missed.

Micro Chips are needed more than ever. Ie Autos, Cloud, Block chain, Energy. 

AMDs big shift (2017) was to outsource foundry and bring in Taiwan base wafers which is highlighted as AMDs biggest successful move. 

AMD has commented in the latest ER that the chip shortage in the media is not going to affect their output. They have the strongest relationship with TSM and internally Lisa Su knows she will have dibs. This is a key foundation for AMD which is affecting two of their biggest lines (profit margin via cheap chips, and capacity not being affected as TSM is going to ship as many chips as AMD needs)

AMD has grown in double digits for the past 3 years. Ie QoQ growth, YoY growth, further, gross profit remains intact and will likely not change as TSM is their horse. Every earnings forecast is revised up. Expecting more double digit growth for the foreseeable future. 

With AMD stock price going down, current PE stands at ~30. This is very low for any tech sector stock, especially one that is expecting large growth in an industry that will only grow.

There is key support at **9.84** and **8.71** \- if you are one of the people long right now hoping for a squeeze - it may be in your best interest to stop out below one of those (daily close).

\-----

Fully prepared to be downvoted to shit for not going along with the group think - but for those who are more focused on making money than catering to their bias - I figured I would give a little $BB roadmap.

This one is not nearly as simple as my previous plays. We are already in the middle of the breakout. We've also **already hit the primary target** I had for said breakout.

From here - we need to look at key supports and resistances to determine whether there is good odds for more upside.

First - let me review the breakout in question:

[$BB 1Y 1D](https://preview.redd.it/19nhc3d71i271.png?width=2244&format=png&auto=webp&s=04bad77e41550e92a0c48c296b07d5f063009f9f)

Here you can see we were stuck in a descending channel from Feb 2nd\~ until May 25th. This is the exact same setup as many other meme stocks. 

After breaking said channel - along with a lot of the other names of this nature - we broke our first key level @ **9.84** with nice volume - and then followed through further to **11.86 -** the far target for this move. Overall - it was a fantastic play and generated some nice profits.

However - **Friday's candle was not pretty -** long wicks like you see there on the top end on a red candle are generally a bad sign for bulls - although I'm not crazy about candlestick reading. It's just one data point. More importantly - we closed lower than we opened with a huge increase in volume. This is often a sign of a major top (or bottom if the role is reversed). 

You can see a similar occurrence on **12/1** \- as well as **1/26** \- although the volume was much higher. Again - just another data point - but one you want to take note of. Every TA post I see here is pretty much people just cherry picking indicators that fit their bias - and that does no one any good. If there is one thing I know - **it's that if you go looking for confirmation bias - you will find it.** Be careful.

Now - let's take a look at the bottom line - **the data that we can actually put into practice, levels:**

Very key support is sitting @ **9.84** \- below that, **8.71.** If we lose the first one, it's not a great sign for momentum. If we lose the second one, I wouldn't go anywhere near this thing.

Now - **for the bull case:**

We have very key resistance @ **11.86 -** if we got a daily close above there, we would rocket straight to **14.37,** maybe even **15.72.**

How I would play this:

Enter long on a **daily close above 11.86 -** target **14.37** take half my position off - set a trailing stop loss on the other half and shoot for **15.72** if volume is supportive.

You always want to let the plays come to you - it's not good to force things.

*Not Financial Advice*

---

Update: Solid close today - memes are rangebound/in no mans land currently chopping back and forth - but potential for crossing that 11.86 tomorrow. The fact that we did not lose 9.84 today was a good sign.

Range is 11.86 - 9.84 looking for a break either way.

Small caps also broke out (RTY) which is great for meme names.

As I type this we are going over 12.10 -

53,BB,nrkvqb,2021-06-03 20:52:32,$BB - Expect Large Movements In 1 Month - Part 5," 

Well, it opened at $20. This pullback is normal and falls in place with expectations. Two major things I'd like to put out that I made in my post last evening:  
"" Tomorrow should if everything is reoccurring and following the trend, be a 30%+ day and probably the highest volume we've ever seen. ""  
We did just that. We hit $20 USD and the highest volume we've ever seen on a daily chart and there's still 1.5 hours left of trading left in the day. Expect a large momentum swing upwards during power hour.  
For all of you that are thinking about pulling out, don't. We haven't even lifted off yet, but we certainly are close.  
The majority of shares were traded at open, this means a large portion of people are sitting $18-$20 USD and will likely be accumulating more on this dip if they are wise.  
Tomorrow's expectation stands. The range will anywhere between $24.75 USD to $33 USD but it is impossible to tell at this point in the game.

Other things I would like to point out on the chart is whenever we've had large openings we have a strong tendency to trade lower than we opened.  
This is of the recent bull (crab) run:

&#x200B;

So what I'm trying to say here is, don't be scared of the short term from what you see at open and what happens the rest of the day. The charts will look uncannily similar and so will our movements. BB has not reached its critical mass yet but god damn are these charts looking similar except we are exceeding volume and institutions have put a LOT more money in $BB under the $10 USD price point.

BB's pincer has only begun to take shape. BB still has a lot of room to grow.

54,UWMC,nawd69,2021-05-12 20:54:55,Why is $UWMC the Best Meme Stock Today?,"I wrote a DD on $UWMC pre-earnings. ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n9xrrg/is_the_market_right_about_uwmc/)). It was obviously too long for people who can't read.

All other meme's stocks are trash today and $UWMC is the only breakout winner. Today's market movements show what UWMC investors already knew: Mat Ishbia is pissed Wall Street doesn't like his company.

See, Mat Ishbia has been in the trenches building UWM from 15 employees to 8,000+ for about 20 years. He did it profitably without outside financing. He sold 7% of his company to take it public at $10/share and Wall Street has been crapping on it ever since.

Remember when you were a kid and took hours drawing that nice picture for your dad and he looked at it for .5 seconds and said, ""You're shit at drawing."" and then went back to drinking his coffee and reading the paper? Yeah, that drawing is $UWMC except the kid is Mat and he is a billionaire.

Here is what is special and unique about $UWMC. The 100m+ shares of the float represent a small fraction of shares. So Mat's personal wealth is affected greatly by little Kenny on Wall Street trying to make a few bucks shorting it. Ken has millions on the line, Mat has billions. And if you don't know this about Mat, dudes a bonafide winner.

He is taking on Rocket Mortgage and plans to be the largest originator in America in five years. He keeps saying he is growing and Wall Street isn't listening. Now... he has a $300 million share buyback war chest, 5%+ dividend, and a tiny float. He just needs a match but the board gave him a flamethrower.

In the conference call he said, ""At these prices, I'm a buyer."" and seemed genuinely giddy to buy tomorrow.

So this price action is just the start of the share buybacks. I'm in it til $16/share.

I'm going to continue purchasing more and more shares, selling way OTM covered calls to be able to buy even more shares up until such a point as my cost basis is below the share-price (My average being roughly 7.5 right now), or the share price nets me a dividend yield below 5.5%. I'm currently wholly allocated to this, and that's why while it would be attractive at a 3% or 4% yield, I'm not going to keep continuously purchasing it. After a certain threshold is reached in regards to the share-price I'll just use the premium on covered calls, and the dividend as a backboard to purchase other securities at that point in time. Considering any shares I buy at 6.38 will net me a dividend yield of 6.26% yield, and the premiums on monthly options that are at 7.5-10 can range from 40 cents to 13 cents for that month for May 21.., I'm well capitalized to receive a minimum 15-20% annual interest on this stock while ensuring significant upside protection in that if my covered calls are exercised they would be exercised at a significant premium to my average cost basis.

T Stock currently has a 6.4% dividend yield. Look at it's balance sheet. Look at UWMC's. Then look back at T's. You'll understand why it's considerably safer to park your money in UWMC. The Payout Ratio for T stock also takes up the majority of earnings per share and by a strong degree, whereas UWMC by dint of its Class A dividend shares only being 1/16th of the shares has a dividend payout ratio that is essentially nothing at 41.5 million dollars a year.

Add to the fact that UWMC has just declared a 300 million share buyback, when the public float is equivalent to 693,000,000 and you see why I think things are going to change by dint of the fact the company is flat out going to be able to buy 43.2% of the float  of exactly 110 million shares. Considering that the dividend is over 6.2% while their senior notes have interest payments of 5.5%.... It makes complete sense for them to immediately start doing buybacks starting today, which is the day they are allowed to start.

Here are some of my thoughts after reading the earnings report please be aware that this was with the share price at roughly 6.5:

The Earnings Report was a decidedly mixed bag, and there's no two ways about it. Here are some of my thoughts that are additional:

1. The 49.1B in origination was a whiff, as they guided for 52-57B in originations. Gain on sale fell right in the middle-ish which was fine. I was right to guide for a little less or roughly 1B in net income, and if the salaries, commissions, and benefits hadn't increased exponentially 123,624 million they would have met right around 1B at 983,624,000.
2. I like they are guiding up as opposed to everyone else for Q2, and considering their miss for Q1 I feel they may even be being conservative so as to not disappoint again. One thing I didn't like was that their gain on sale margin was expected to be .75%-1.1% for Q2, but one part of that may be that they have an in-house jumbo program where they retain servicing which might compress margin. With that said, there is definitely a pricing war going on, and as the CEO of LDI said we don't know when that'll end but as he stated no one likes to sell something for ninety cents on the dollar, and we can expect higher margins when the pricing war cools. Please note RKT's wholesale margin is expected to be 1%.
3. I like that they are investing in "" Continued investment into machine learning and Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to further advance our operational excellence while driving down costs."" Margin expansion is key, especially since they already have a margin advantage.
4. I like that they have ""Continued to invest in our technology platform and on-site teams resulting in additional operational efficiencies focused on reducing costs, reducing closing times, and increasing loan processing speed"" since, again, margin advantage. I also like reduced closing and loan processing speeds.
5. I like that: ""Our continued investments in the cloud, as well as technologies that increase Underwriting efficiency, such as Automated Document Recognition and Optical Character Recognition, have strengthened our technology advantage while driving greater efficiency, and reducing both fixed and variable costs."" Ditto with everything else.
6. Their jumbo and government portion of both refinance and purchase are extremely low relative to Q1 2020 because they only turned the spigot back on them the latter part of March. This is probably why it's so low, and why they are guiding up. Remember the gain on sale margin for government loans are smaller than conventional though so that might help explain some of the margin compression. This should also help them Q3 and Q4.
7. The seasonally adjusted annual homebuilding rate is at over 1.7 million home as April. There is a 4 million home backlog, and to keep up with demand home builders need to build 1.2 million homes a year. It needs to be more than 1.2 million to start reducing the backlog.
8. RKT's share price was roughly 20 dollars when it announced its 1 billion dollar buyback and had a market cap of 40 billion at the time. UWMC's market cap is roughly 10.8B. So it's market cap is exactly 27% what RKT's was at the time of the buyback. But the share buyback is 30% of RKT's. So there is more bang for buck. Additionally, there was a 1.1B special dividend of 1.1B which equated to roughly 5.5% at 20 dollars. The current annual yield on UWMC is over 6%. What's more, doing share buyback will increase EPS, net income, cash flow, and the balance sheet as opposed to RKT where it will only help EPS. Therefore, there is strong upside to be had at this price point.
9. I like that their highest expense (employees) is variable and stands at above 2/3rds of their expenses since it's easy to downsize in times of hardship, or they can choose to maintain staffing levels but not replace people to leave for a natural deceleration of income.
10. RKT  is expecting closed loan volume of between 82.5 to 87.5B. That's a sharp decrease in origination volume of between 15.5% and 20.3%. This is an strong indication that the UWMC ultimatum knee-capped them. Please remember that the UWMC Ultimatum deadline was March 15, and Q1 is for the period ended March 31 for RKT. Please note that the Partner Channel isn't just wholesale broker's as they also lump other things in there like their correspondent (referral) channel there. I also found the 7.5% increase from 37 and something to 40 billion from Q4 2020 to Q1 2021 to be quite small regardless, but Q2 makes clear you can expect downward guidance on their Wholesale channel. Now, while UWMC may have won the wholesale volume war, it's paying a price. The entire wholesale channel is. While rates rising means a lower gain on sale margin, the pricing wars are cutting deep into gain on sale margin to. With that said, there is eventually going to be rationality as this cannot go on forever. No one likes to sell something for ninety cents when they can sell it for a dollar. So I call the gain on sale margin variable in essence. Finally, I expect investments to bear fruit and increase margin offsetting some of the pricing wars affect on GOS (for both sides to be fair).
11. I'm revising my expectations of 2-2.5 Billion dollars a year in net income to roughly 1.5-2.25 Billion, and I am being very conservative on the low end. I am calculating roughly 500 million in net income for Q2 2021 to be somewhat conservative. The way I am coming to that conclusion is by calculating a 49.1B origination for Q2 even though they are guiding for 51-55B (and considering the embarrassment of the whiff, and the new products they have on offer to increase capacity, I believe them to be conservative). I am also assuming a 75 basis point margin on gain on sale which is a touch more than 34% of the margin for Q1 2021. Under these presumptions they would be making 368,035,000 in loan production income. I am going to flat out live in delusion land and assume that Mortgage Servicing Income remains the same at 115,205,000 after accounting for the fact that mortgage servicing income minus change in fair value, plus gain on sale, and interest income equals that. That totals revenue of 483,240,000. I am going to assume the absolute worst and assume that they don't compress their expenses whatsoever and so their expenses will tally 317,000,000. Thus their net income will be 166,240,000.

I won't place the income tax because: ""UWMC's net income for periods prior to the first quarter of 2021 does not reflect an income tax provision, since UWM (UWMC's accounting predecessor) is a pass-through entity not subject to federal and most state income taxes. For periods commencing with the first quarter of 2021, UWMC's net income does not reflect the income tax provision that would otherwise be reflected if 100% of the economic interest in UWM was owned by UWMC. Therefore, for comparison purposes, UWMC provides “Adjusted net income”, which is our pre-tax income adjusted for a 23.78% estimated effective tax rate. “Adjusted net income” is a Non-GAAP Metric.""

If one looks at the net income attributable to UWMC on the cash flow statement and then divides by the provision for income taxes, then that is an effective tax rate of 26.8% for roughly 5.7% of the float which is roughly the 6 percent of free float. What I am trying to say is that we only pay net income on the 6% of free float that is the Class A public float. The adjusted net income would be if the entirety of the company was taxed, which it isn't, so disregard adjusted net income as it's not GAAP. We'll assume a 25 percent haircut to income tax as a result (though it would be a higher haircut, I'm just lazy) which would give taxes of 9,664.

After accounting for federal and state taxes, the new net income would be 166,230,336. Net income and thus EPS is pre dividend income, but let's count the dividend before EPS and count it as part of net income for a truly catastrophic scenario. So, let's assume no share buybacks occurred (worst case scenario), we'd then remove 10,310,420.5 (.10\* 103,104,205). The new net income after accounting for dividends is 155,919,916. Please note that in accounting you don't calculate the net income by putting the dividend as a expense. I'm just doing this to give you guys an absolute shit tier scenario with revenue misses, no mortgage servicing rights increases and thus no mortgage servicing income and interest increases, no margin gain, expenses that do not decrease, a bit more tax than they'd actually pay, no shares bought back, and dividends as an expense and thus weigh down on net income and thus EPS. I did not count the interest expense on the new 700 million senior notes however. But it should come to roughly 31 million.

The EPS would be .097, so round it to ten cents. Account for the same EPS for Q3 and Q4. You get 30 cents. This is 30 cents without the dividend payout ratio since the dividend is already accounted for. We'll not include Q1. The dividend of 40 cents alone will net you a p/e ratio of 16.175. The actual EPS for you as a class A shareholder would be 70 cents for the period Q2 to Q4. That would translate to a P/E ratio of 9.24. If you count the EPS of Q1 (which is Earnings per share of .47) then the FY 2021 EPS would be .70 and the P/E ratio would be 8.64. But if you count the dividend of .40 in addition to the EPS then it becomes 1.17 and the P/E ratio becomes 5.52. The only reason I count the dividend is because the dividend payout ratio is literally .006 (.10\*.06=.006) per quarter. However, you're still getting ten cents a quarter on a stock that is 6.47 while retaining your economic interest in the company itself which is adding roughly 77 cents in EPS FY 2021 under a catastrophic failure of epic proportions scenario.

This is already a no-brain play. The price of the stock has been suppressed for weeks by shorts and it is a ticking time bomb. B

Even the CEO has said these analysts should kill themselves.

The price of steel is at an all time high which means that the profit margins of companies lik CLF, who are vertically integrated with mining, processing, and producing are higher than ever. 

Let's take a look at the options chains

EXPIRING THIS WEEK:

24,000 OPEN INTERESTED OTM CALLS EXPIRING WITHIN 10% price difference.

EXPIRING NEXT WEEK:

30K ITM
30K OTM WITHIN 10%

With a 10.123B market cap @ 20.27 a share we are looking at 500M shares.

WITH THE CALLS EXPIRING WE ARE LOOKING AT 6,000,000 SHARES ALONE WHICH EQUALS MORE THAN 10% OF THE FLOAT.

With a realistic price target set 20% higher than current price, and a massive surge in options being exercised within 10%, I'm expecting a share price of AT LEAST $30 short term. I'm surprised this stock hasn't had more publicity in forums personally so I thought I'd add onto the post I saw earlier.

Bull sign or just measure of precaution?","So, while my wife and her boyfriend kicked me out this morning to play WWE in the living room, I bought calls on BB. Stonk went up. First time I’ve seen a *real* green day since March. While watching through the window, I switched back and forth between spanking the shit out of my little ape to my wife’s wrestle mania moves and my portfolio. 

As I lay in the front yard, covered in my own banana sauce, neighbors walked by with their dog, sneering that I had been subjected to “window duty” again. Immediately, I stood up, still covered head to toe in my banana sauce like I was attacked by some kind of spooky ghost. I walked right over to them, and proceeded to 360 no-scope cock slap them. Don’t worry, I hit the collat. 

As they lay on the ground in writhing agony with my cock perfectly imprinted on their faces, I had a sudden thought. Today was a good day. With BlackBerry up so much and the last strike for Friday being 20, BlackBerry has a chance to gamma squeeze. I went back into the house, glowing with a sense of accomplishment. I went to check the options chain to see how the rest of the BB calls did to see that MMs added strikes for this Friday, two days before expiration. So, gamma squeeze unlikely, but still.

Is this a bull sign? Or am I just a smooth brained retard doomed to bathe in his own banana sauce until the end of time? I’m wondering if this is just standard practice for MMs or they’re actually worried about how the price action is gonna go tomorrow. I’m tryna find out if I get to sit at the adult table tomorrow or if I have sit at the kid’s table again and eat my Dino nuggets as my wife’s boyfriend performs a special wrestling move on her he calls “the Cleveland steamer”.",Discussion,0.91

84,UWMC,nbkat0,2021-05-13 18:12:36,Why Boomers and Millennials like $UWMC,"Boomers and Millennials agree on little nowadays. One is lazy, doesn't listen, already knows everything, and only thinks about themselves. The other are millennials. But $UWMC is a stock both can buy and hold for short term or long term. Here's why:

**The millennials case for $UWMC:**

Stock Deeply Undervalued: millennials love stocks that hedgies have (allegedly) artificially pushed down the price. UWM is a growing company and Wall Street has positioned itself as if UWM is shrinking.

Share Buybacks: millennials will recognize this buyback is different then say Apple. With $300 million in buybacks, UWM can reduce the whole float by almost 40%.

Option Open Interest: There are 131,934 open interest in options (as of this morning) with strikes at $10 and under. That is a lot of shares that the sellers of those options would need to find. The float could be reduced significantly by share buybacks at that time. Institutional investors easily control 20+million shares and they aren't selling at these prices. Gores holds 15.8m shares they bought for $10 a few months ago.

CEO: Mat is pissed Wall Street doesn't love his company as much as he does. He will do what it takes to get the price to what he needs it to be with the buybacks. He is game to play.

**The boomer case for $UWMC:**

Mortgages: Boomers love mortgages, the bigger the better. UWM is the largest wholesale mortgage provider in America. The mortgage industry isn't going anywhere and boomer's small brains can at least understand that.

Healthy Financials: UWM runs a tight ship and is very profitable. It also trades at a low P/E around 6 or so. Boomers love low P/E's cause they hate tech and tech is ""expensive"". They buy low P/E companies like T cause they are much smarter than millennials at investing.

Dividends: Boomers love dividends. They think it is free money. At a $7.5 stock price $UWMC pays a 5.3% dividend. But even better, UWM pays a dividend on its class A shares only. Class A is only 7% of the outstanding shares, so it costs UWM $42 million to pay a 5.3% dividend. For context, their net income Q1 was $800m+.

Share Buybacks: Boomers love getting their capital returned in a slow, and boring way. UWMC has a $300 million share buyback underway right now.

Mat Ishbia: Mat is a CEO boomers love. He played team sports and won an NCAA national championship riding the bench at Michigan State. Boomers love reading stories like that because they always preached hard work to their own kids from the couch.

So either a short term or long term investment, boomer or millenial, $UWMC looks interesting.",DD,0.88

86,AMC,nw04kf,2021-06-09 18:35:01,$CLOV showing a similar pattern as $AMC and $CLOV prediction for this week,"Pattern:

I've been patient with AMC in the last of couple days with over $100k invested @$19. I'm starting see a familiar pattern with CLOV. I see a similar pattern with AMC's second day of rise and CLOV's behavior today. With an initial spike, both of these stocks all started with a high pre-market price and a cooldown throughout the day. Eventually, AMC showed this pattern for a day or two until it shot up for the last time before the short squeeze began. CLOV is still at an infant phase of a massive potential squeeze. The shorts are putting on pressure to keep CLOV low, but the counter pressure from retail investors are holding the stock and not give into the panic. Holding the line for a day or two will accumulate more retail investors, who are buying these dips. If CLOV is the next short squeeze play, it will surpass AMC in a heartbeat.

Prediction:

CLOV is a gamble play for sure. There is always a probability of short squeeze happening depending on many factors, like media and sentiment. However, CLOV was my next pick because the numbers showed me that it definitely had a massive squeeze potential, and I saw a familiar resemblance with AMC. High risk high reward.

If CLOV plays out like how AMC did, CLOV will close today with the resistance around $17\~$18 range. The next morning, CLOV will see a massive spike during the pre-market and cooling off for a bit throughout the day. Then CLOV would've stabilized around $20 and the shorts will start to get impatient. They will have to cover their shorts because they are not seeing CLOV going down anywhere close to $7\~8 again in the next couple of days. Thus, the short squeeze will begin. Once it begins, more retail investors will join in. With the options expiring on the 18th, more people will join in seeing a potential gamma squeeze. I can see this stock go to an unimaginable numbers if the pattern continues. 

This is a domino effect play. The first step has to be completed before moving onto the next. I believe that the first step is already completed, and we are at the second step, fighting against bearish sentiment. Third step is the squeeze. Fourth step is wait for the squeeze to stabilize, and the last step is to cash out the profit.

This is purely my personal opinions and not a financial advice. Seeing how big the wallstreetbets community is, a pattern like this is likely to happen again. At the end of the day, retail investors don't change their behaviors over night because we are not under any management or any strategy. The pattern will repeat.",Discussion,0.72

**EMA (Exponential Moving Average) significance:**

EMAs are one of my favorite indicators that I use to follow ""trends"" of a stock. It is darn near impossible to predict EXACT dates, prices, etc.. but EMA's allow a trader to notice trends and possible reversals. All stocks have a tendency to deviate toward the mean whether it is a crazy upward advance or sell off, and then will draw closer to the mean eventually. And in this case after a huge run up like that the price will settle a bit but as long as it stays above the EMA it will continue up. The stock has been above the 55 EMA on the 15 min chart since $12.44 and if it fights to get back above which it looks to be doing then I am seeing an upward to continuation (hopefully). But remember I am smooth brained, this is not financial advice.

Ok apes, chimps, gorillas, primates of all stripes... I'm going to level with you. I am posting this mainly because I want to throw one of my best ideas into the ring. But that's not the only reason I am writing this. I also want to inspire those of you who are just getting started in this game. For those who say that retail investors can't consistently make money in markets, I present you with some recent gain porn for your viewing pleasure. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gyvyzp0yln371.png?width=1355&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf56089ae7e9cff017cacdc546e9aa3c9e55f329

Look, I won't lie, making money investing is not easy -- lots of smart people are trying to do the same thing. But the real challenge is having the emotional resilience to stick with your thesis, and while not easy, if you stick to basic math and only invest in what you know, it is simple. 

As retail investors, we have a huge advantage over the big guys on Wall Street who need to hug the benchmarks, satisfy investor demands for quarterly results and invest only where they can expect to generate acceptable ""risk-adjusted"" returns where risk is bizarrely defined as ""volatility"", instead of permanent impairment of capital, which is how I see it. 

We can arbitrage these structural weaknesses in institutional portfolio management by making contrarian bets on stocks that are currently out of favor with the big guys, provided we've done our homework on the business and believe that it is undervalued. Eventually, if we are right about the trajectory of the business, they will eventually be forced to buy us out at a huge premium when the results prove out and herd mentality kicks back in the other way. 

I've made a nice chunk of coin on several positions over the last few years, which has enabled me to make bigger investments, and I am currently up materially on my latest portfolio positions. These are positions I have held for long time periods, with Bed Bath and Beyond being the largest position, the longest held and highest percentage gains. In my view, it also has the most upside, so I want to share a bit more with you about my thesis.

**Nothing I've said or am about to say should be construed in any way as investment advice.** **This is just me sharing my YOLO, with an explanation for my thesis.** 

Bed Bath and Beyond was a successful business when it first arrived on the scene, practically creating and defining the concept of Big Box Retail. As so often happens in life, their huge initial success bred complacency, and the co-founders (Warren Eisenberg and Leonard Feinstein) who continued presiding over the Board basically ran the company like it was their private piggy bank, without regard for small (or even large) shareholders. 

Under the leadership of Steven Temares, the CEO they handpicked, the business failed to innovate and keep up with basic changes taking place in retail -- such as the rise of e-commerce. BBBY began to see online giants like Amazon and even brick & mortar mass merchants like Target and Lowes begin to eat their lunch. Steven Temares, along with the rest of the c-suite, continued to receive huge salaries and bonuses, while the two co-founders received generous perks like personal black-car chauffer services, all paid for by the company -- and therefore, shareholders. 

They also refused to answer basic questions posited by Wall Street research analysts on earnings calls, seeing the investment community essentially as a nuisance to be tolerated but not proxies for the true owners of the business -- public investors. 

Well, the situation got so bad that finally, circa mid-2019 in the year of our chimp lord, a trifecta of activist investors led by Legion Partners (founder was trained by legendary activist Nelson Peltz) and John Duskin at Macellum Capital decided to wage war, buying up \~6% of the stock and filing a 170 white paper detailing all of the problems with how the company was being run and proposing to replace the entire Board of Directors and management team with its own slate of nominees. The presentation, which is phenomenal, is posted here:

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886158/000092189519001180/ex1dfan14a09050028_04262019.pdf

They went so far as to create a website for their campaign, [restorebedbath.com](https://restorebedbath.com/), which they eventually dismantled after reaching a cooperation and settlement agreement with the Board of Directors. This agreement effectively ceded control to the activists, who proceeded to replace everyone. It was a real Red Wedding style bloodbath... I mean total scorched earth policy... no respect for life. While it's never pleasant seeing people get canned, these people deserved it. After years and years of unaccountable shareholder abuse, someone finally came along and pulled out the game cartridge, blew on it and hit ""reset"" on the console. And they saw that it was good. 

In November 2019 they announced Mark Tritton, legendary Chief Merchandising Officer from Target who was the main person responsible for their massive success in developing private label / owned brand programs, would be taking the helm as CEO. Since taking charge, Mark has consistently been executing on the playbook laid out by the activists in their white paper, which basically calls for making low risk / high return changes to bring Bed Bath and Beyond up to modern retailing standards using well established best practices. 

While some would argue that a turnaround of this magnitude carries high execution risk, I would disagree at this time for several reasons: (1) The changes they have been making are actually quite well established strategies for modern retailing, with loads of case studies to pull from (Best Buy, Target, Lowes, etc); (2) they have the best team you could ask for implementing these changes (i.e., Mark Tritton and John Hartmann, who became COO of BBBY after a highly successful run as CEO of True Value hardware chains); (3) their compensation is heavily geared towards stock compensation, so **they only win if we all win;** and (4) most of the highest risk action plans, like divesting of non-core assets, culling unproductive / unprofitable stores, reducing bloated headcount and liquidating stale inventories at reasonable valuations, are all in the rear-view mirror. 

As of June 2021, Bed Bath and Beyond is at an inflection point with a strong focus on driving profitable growth from its core business lines. This comes down to a few very important strategies: (1) focusing on digital first, omni-always capabilities (leading with the website and mobile app but making sure they are able to serve customers however, whenever and wherever they want to shop -- think curbside pick-up, same-day delivery and buy-online pick-up in store aka BOPIS); (2) focusing on key destination categories where the company is seen as an authority in the home, driving preference for BBBY over other chains and even national brands by defining its key categories using data and developing owned brands to fill out their assortment in those areas (they have launched 6 so far this year, with another 4 expected by end of year -- ultimately they expect 30% of their sales to come from the brands they have created). This will help help them in multiple ways. First, the products are only going to be available at BBBY, so they are re-establishing their authority in the home and preference for BBBY as a brand and not just a venue to shop other manufacturers' products (this also means these items can't be bought online except for thru BBBY, so it is Amazon defense playbook 101). Second, these products have been strategically developed in areas where they had gaps in their assortment relative to the competitors they were losing share to. As mentioned above, development of these brands was informed by **data**, including detailed line reviews and purchasing data. Third, and final, these products are designed to cost and have very healthy margins that should improve the overall margin profile of the business as they are rolled out. This fireside chat with Mark Tritton from January 2021 explains it all far better than I can, and is well worth watching for curious apes: 

[https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/videos/a-fireside-chat-with-mark-tritton-president-and-ceo-of-bed-bath-and-beyond/](https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/videos/a-fireside-chat-with-mark-tritton-president-and-ceo-of-bed-bath-and-beyond/)

**So where does this all leave us today?**

The company has successfully implemented its digital first, omni-always capabilities, rolling out BOPIS, curbside pickup and same-day delivery (just signed up deals with Instacart & Doordash). Digital sales were up 86% in the most recent quarter and 99% in the Bed Bath banner (they also own Buy Buy Baby, which is the largest national baby retail chain in the US with the bankruptcy of Babies R US -- this alone makes BBBY an interesting investment with tons of hidden value).

For the first time in **years**, the company began posting positive same-store sales for the last 3 quarters under Mark Tritton (consistently comping up in the mid-single digits). This is a very positive sign of the changes taking place already. Same-store sales metrics are probably the most important data point for retailers, as it basically tells you if consumers think they have a good reason to exist. Quite frankly, it is an extraordinary achievement by Mark and his team that after years of declining same-store sales they are now positive for 3 consecutive quarters, and I don't think this has gotten enough attention.

They have also begun launching their new owned brands, with 6 already launched and another 4 or so on the way this year. These brands have a strong focus on their top 5 destination categories (bedding, bath, kitchen & food prep, indoor decor, and organization) -- I've personally purchased and used these products, and they are excellent quality at reasonable price points. I think they will do great.

They are repurchasing $1bn of their own stock (at least $375mm completed so far at an average price of \~$23 per share, reducing their share count from \~126mm to \~109mm.

Normalizing their revenues for divested brands and culling of unprofitable / lowest productivity stores in their footprint, management has guided to \~$8.2bn of sales and $525mm of EBITDA **this year,** with sales comping up in the low- to mid-single digits range for the next several years and EBITDA margins improving to high single digits / low double digits resulting in EBITDA of $850mm-$1bn by YE 2023.

Applying simple mathematics and established standards of value, I believe the evidence shows that businesses in this industry (big box and specialty retail) would typically be valued at \~8-12x EBITDA which would imply an enterprise value (value of the whole business, not just the equity) of \~$9bn at the midpoint, which seems eminently reasonable for an iconic retailer under solid leadership with about 1000 stores and authority in key growing segments of the US economy.

Since they have virtually the same amount of cash as debt, the enterprise value should be about the same as the equity value, so \~$9bn at the midpoint above. With \~109mm shares outstanding today, that puts implied equity value per share at \~$82, but where it gets even more interesting is if you factor in the share buybacks. They've still got $625mm of remaining authorized share repurchases under their existing program, and depending on how cheap they are able to buy those shares they could materially reduce the share count further.

**So why are the big institutional investors continuing to ignore this stock? Why does everyone continue to ignore the insanely cheap valuation and upside potential under the extraordinary new leadership of Mark Tritton, John Hartmann and the rest of the new team?** 

I can think of several possibilities, but probably the main one is a backward looking bias, because the memory of the old management team and their awful performance dies hard. Their prolonged period of value destruction also gave rise to a narrative, parroted widely by thematic investors and talking heads on CNBC, basically a nonsense theory that all brick & mortar would die and the consumer would only ever want to shop at Amazon (somehow ignoring blatantly contradictory evidence provided by Target, Lowes, Walmart, etc). 

In this excellent interview with burgeoning hedge fund manager Dan McMurtrie (aka Supermugatu), he discusses the reality of how Amazon is killing bad retail, not all retail, and how certain investors / the media have taken the the idea way too far as they so often love to do. **I cannot recommend this highly enough -- well worth watching beginning at 39:45.**

[https://www.realvision.com/unmasking-supermugatu-how-the-pros-find-edge](https://www.realvision.com/unmasking-supermugatu-how-the-pros-find-edge)

It might take some time for BBBY to shake off the worries created during the former management team's tenure. Most of the time, the stock market is forward looking, but in this case investors have adopted a thesis that has them psychologically stuck in the past due to PTSD, and the distractions in rear-view mirror are blinding them to what is likely to happen in the next 6, 12, 18 months. 

Eventually, I personally expect BBBY to shock the market with positive results one of these quarters, forcing a rapid, seemingly unexpected valuation revision in the stock. They have already begun to put up excellent numbers, if you look at the underlying same-store sales, digital growth, growth in top 5 destination categories, for example. However, there has still been a lot of noise in the numbers from divestitures, culling of store footprint, COVID impact in 2020, etc., and it appears that perception has not caught up yet with the new reality.

While I haven't focused on it much here, the company also has an excellent balance sheet with over $1bn of cash, no meaningful near-term debt maturities, solidly positive free cash flow generation & very high short interest.

Even with all of the prevailing negative sentiment, this has been a profitable investment for me so far (I purchased heavily in periods where others abandoned hope over the last few years). In my opinion, the company is probably worth about $80 / share as of today, however with continued solid execution and more enthusiasm coming back into the name, I could see this valued well into the triple digits. 

So, even with my sizeable gains I haven't sold one share and don't plan to anytime soon. I am holding this baby to the end.",DD,0.72

Overall, UWMC actually has had consistently higher net income margin than RKT, currently sitting at 68% vs. 58% for RKT.

UWMC's focus on wholesaling and working entirely with brokers makes it much easier for it to pivot to home purchase originations, which Freddie Mac actually predicts will grow 16% by 2022. Home purchases are more complex than refinances and the value of using a broker shines in those cases. In fact, UWMC is already more heavy on home purchases than its competitors. In the most recent quarter, 25% of its volume came from home purchases. Furthermore, a rise in interest rates may actually benefit UWMC in that the value of the loans they generate will be higher due to the higher cash flows.",Discussion,0.79

&#x200B;

\*\*\* If you aren't in TSM ( ***Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing***) you hate money. Here are some reasons you should look into this stock and buy it before it is too late. \*\*\*

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Economics 101, Supply and Demand.**

* TSM is the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the world
* THERE IS A WORLDWIDE SEMICONDUCTOR SHORTAGE
* Let me emphasize this point. THERE IS A WORLDWIDE SEMICONDUCTOR SHORTAGE

As many of you know, there is a worldwide semiconductor shortage (yes I said it again). These semiconductors are vital components in every electronic we use today. Without these semiconductors, things like smartphones, automobiles, video game consoles, etc. Would not be able to function.

(Read the following if you want to see why these semiconductors are so vital...or just completely trust me, that's fine too)

***\*ALL COMPUTERS NEEDS SEMICONDUCTORS TO FUNCTION\****

Semiconductors are used primarily in electronic devices, including chips, diodes, transistors, and integrated circuits. According to Goldman Sachs 169 industries rely on semiconductors. Anything that is computerized or uses radio waves depends on semiconductors. Your phone is a computer, your car is a computer, your video game consoles are computers, your amazon firestick is a computer, every aspect of your life is dependent on these semiconductors.

TSM PRODUCES THESE CHIPS FOR THE FOLLWOING COMPANIES AND MANY MORE:
-Apple
-Toyota
-NVIDIA
-AMD
-SO MANY MORE

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do you believe the future of automobiles are powered by electric? Not without semiconductors.

**Semiconductors in Automobiles**

1. **Vehicle electrification –** Semiconductors have made it possible to replace manual systems with electrical systems. Electrification of key systems provides benefits such as increased vehicle efficiency, reductions in carbon emissions, and minimizing oil dependency.
2. **Safety and driver assistance –** The increasing need for better safety and driver assistance systems in cars has provided a niche for semiconductors. Intelligent functions such as backup cameras, blind-spot detection, adaptive cruise control, lane change assist, airbag deployment, and emergency braking systems are all made possible through the integration of semiconductor technologies.
3. **Connectivity –** Cars are increasingly incorporating technology that improves their connectivity. New vehicles on the market include ever-more sophisticated telematics (long-distance data transmission) and infotainment capabilities which feed drivers information on factors such as road closures, collision avoidance, and even free parking spaces at their destination. On-board computers which handle this information have to process millions of lines of code every second. Semiconductors allow cars to stay connected in real-time.

Semiconductors are key to the future of the electric vehicle (EV) industry as they help to control the powertrain and battery. Semiconductors are also used in the variety of touchscreens that are installed in the driver’s dash and in the back of passenger seats.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**FINANCIALS/NEWS**

* Financially, the company has reported its third straight quarter of record sales in its first-quarter earnings report back in April.
* Its revenue came in 25.4% higher year-over-year to 12.9 billion.
* The stock has more than doubled in price over the past year
* Japan’s government recently announced that it wants TSM and Sony to invest $9.2 billion to build the country’s first 20-nanometer chip plant.
* Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) said on Friday (5/21/2021) that it has increased its 2021 output for a key component for automotive semiconductors by 60% compared with last year, amid a global chip shortage.

These are just a couple of things. If This has caught your eye please research TSM on your own and you can find more great news and financial statements...or don't, you've made it this far, might as well go all in.

105,DNMR,nunagh,2021-06-07 22:53:38,$CLOV &amp; $DNMR Flash Buy Signals,"One tried and true method of deciding when to buy—and when to sell—is to watch the charts. Clover Healthcare (CLOV) and Danimer Scientific (DNMR) both flashed buy signals in the past few days. Both companies are the target of Short Seller attacks and law firms soliciting customers to join shareholder lawsuits. The good news is that both CLOV and DNMR are rebounding, and I think this is just the beginning. Both are well off their 52 week highs, and both have a long way to run.

One of the simplest methods for new investors to answer the question of when to buy is to watch the Simple Moving Averages (SMA). When the 5 Day Moving Average crosses the 30 Day Moving Average going up, it’s a buy signal. 

Using this method, AMC gave a buy signal on May 13th, when the stock closed at $12.98. We all know what happened after that.

https://preview.redd.it/6p6b9786ow371.jpg?width=1049&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf9859bdf9aae55e8c9789b566e21e2231460f85

This method isn’t foolproof. It will give some false buy and sell signals, and by definition you won’t catch the high or the low, but it will catch major up and down trends.   


**$CLOV gave a buy signal on June 3rd, when the stock closed at $8.90**  
CLOV also gave a false buy and sell in May, essentially selling it and buying it back at the same price.

https://preview.redd.it/7y4x7t5cow371.jpg?width=1049&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7350ae99bd09b9121e359dd44801208114c36cbd

**$DNMR gave a buy signal on Jun 1st, when the stock closed at $21.88.**  
Following this signal with DNMR, you would have had a false sell and buy signal in Feb and Mar, but you would have sold it at $37.90 on 3/25, preventing a long, painful ride down before it bottomed out at $15.38. Selling it at $37.90 and buying it back at $21.88 would also let you buy back more shares. 

https://preview.redd.it/n75xpi6kow371.jpg?width=1049&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5bae3f68eb5c966cf9fe8a9526d7d1b4fc64409a

Even with the occasional head fakes, this signal catches the long term trends up and down. I think it’s another useful datapoint to double-check your investment decisions.  
 

**Support and Resistance**  
 As another datapoint, both CLOV and DNMR are above most of their moving averages. CLOV is above its 30, 50, 100 and 200 day moving averages. DNMR is above its 30, 50 and 200 day moving averages, but still below its 100 day moving average.  
 

**CLOV**  
 30 Day SMA: 8.30  
 50 Day SMA: 8.19  
 100 Day SMA: 9.61  
 200 Day SMA: 10.55  
 

**DNMR**  
 30 Day SMA: 21.61  
 50 Day SMA: 26.06  
 100 Day SMA: 34.60  
 200 Day SMA: 23.90  
 

**Fundamentals are Strong**  
Both $CLOV and $DNMR have fundamentally strong businesses in the early growth stage. Clover is a small, growing healthcare company with proprietary software. Danimer Scientific makes biodegradable plastic resin, and is aiming to address the single use plastic waste crisis. I believe both companies have bright futures, with sales and earnings expected to continue climbing in the years ahead.  
 

**Short Interest**  
This isn’t the reason to buy, but it may be icing on the cake. According to Marketwatch, CLOV has 35.8% of the float shorted, well above GME (21%), AMC (18.93%) and BB (9.0%). DNMR has 15.8% of its float shorted. (I realize this varies from day to day and site to site)

**CLOV: 35.8% of Float Shorted**  
**DNMR: 15.8% of Float Shorted**  
 

**Summary**  
 I believe CLOV and DNMR have bright, promising futures, and I expect them to gain both short term and long term.

-🚀 Intro to Protein and mRNA type Vaccines🚀 -
Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

             
                           
-🚀Differences how Protein vs.mRNA vaxs work🚀 -
Imagine if the whole spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize it to understand the whole picture, and helps modify your Messenger RNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates  one piece of that picture it can still recognize the virus due to being able to see various other parts of the picture. In the mRNA method using one portion of the picture as virus mutates,  it becomes easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine ... that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. .... And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein.



-🚀 Safety, Side Effects, and Adjuvenants  🚀-
 Every vaccine uses what's called an adjuvenant. This basically boosts the vaccines effectiveness. There's different kinds, and every company uses one in their vaccine. Not all are created equal. What makes Nvaxs adjuvenant (called Matrix M) so special is its the only plant based (soapbark tree) adjuvenant out there, and is the least irritating. This adjuvenant has been tested on pregnant women in the past and pases with the flying colors. mRNA adjuvenant vaccines use common molecules found in viruses and bacteria that stimulate our immune system. This approach has not been fully tested on pregnant women long term. One of the most common types that were used in the past were aluminum salts. They were found not to be ""harmful"" but we also didn't know enough about them and how they affect us on a grander scale. A lot of anti-vaxxers are against aluminum salts and giving it to the children. This is why Nvax will be the perfect solution for anti-vaxxers, children and the eldery that want something completely safe. Just using the term plant-based in a vaccine adds a good connotation, let alone the stronger protection/immune responce it provides. As far as what the virus is grown in,  Nvax uses a moth based formula. So it's insect and plant-based. Sounds like the Karen's will love this! Ultra safe. 


Adjuvenants work by creating an irritation/inflammation at the injection site, This in turn helps the vaccines be more effective apon administration. This is what makes you feel sore after getting a vaccine and specifically amount of adjuvenate that being used.  NVAX only needs to use 5mM vs  mRNA type vaccines use anywhere from 50 to 100 mM of adjuvenant. Therefore when getting a mRNA type vaccines you get a much stronger side effect due to the large amount being used. This is proof how effective nvax is because they need to use so little to be to get a strong immune response. Hence why they have the best data and we're called a first in class vaccine. In conjunction with how much adjuvenant is being used you can also say it directly alters the safety profile. Use too much and you get too many bad reactions. This is why Nvax has one of the best safety profiles out there.Hands down 🙌 Bottom of my post is a link with a lot of the data charted out that includes all the side effects of each vaccine charted.


 Lastly because the amount of ajuvenant used in mRNA type vaccines can only fit one maybe two strains max before throwing off the safety profile and risking not getting approval.  If they do use two strains they have to use less adjuvenant for both to combine them, meaning you're not going to get complete protection for each strain from the vaccine.  Nvax does not have this problem because of the such small amount they use, they could combine up to five different strains without an issue.... And right now with it being so clear that covid strains are going to keep mutating we need vaccines thay can cover multiple strains and give full protection on each one. Sometimes one strain can cover multiple strains but depending on where the strain mutates, a bad mutation will require addressing each strain individually and putting them together in one vaccine. Since you can't get four strains in one mRNA vaccine this puts us out at a clear advantage down the road when people need to do booster shots, and don't want to get multiple vaccines through the year.  So all in all it's clear Nvax adjuvenant separates itself from the pack and performs much better then other kinds on Safety, Effectiveness, Coverage of all strains and convenience of less shots in a given year.


-🚀 Logistics and Storage.🚀 -
Nvax can be stored in a regular refrigerator, and can be left out to sit out in room temperature for a while while you're vaccinating people. A special ultra low temp freezer is needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers. This is a majority of the world, not to mention the intricate ways you got to handle it so increases your distribution cost because you need special warehouses, dry ice etc. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

                 
- 🚀 Scientific conclusion 🚀  -
So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). As of now Nvax elicits the strongest immune response out of any vaccine with the highest efficacy. Another thing that's really important to know is every trial is not built the same. Every company creates different end points for their trials. Some are looking for severe disease, some are counting everything mild, medium and severe. Nvax counted every single possible infection whether it was mild medium or severe. Case in point j&j didn't have very good efficacy in South Africa so what they did was they only counted the most severe cases so they could say that their vaccine works. (Great you won't die but you'll get so sick you wish you did).
 When looking at mild cases their vaccine didn't work very well. This is why it's always hard to tell apples to apples when you look at efficacy numbers because every trial is different. So you have to look at the devil in the details. 


It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines. This puts other competitors far behind us, giving nvax a economic moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing! They teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy which of P3 is the same it's good enough for approval). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine, and phase 3 is already complete and now they're moving on for approval. They will running a trial on their flu and covid combo vaccine, and once launched they could double the price of current covid vaccine due to being a 2 for 1. Moderna and Pfizer are also looking at a combo shot but they haven't even started trials yet. The problem is they can't even finish their trials because flu is non-existent right now so be very hard for them to get trials done for a long time. 



 -🚀 Investment Thesis & Financials  🚀-
Nvax is pretty much de-risked at this point vs where they were a year ago. Yes you could buy other biotechs that can go up 20x, but they are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up, generally takes years for companies to get to this point if not decades.) They have all successful trials, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment; where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place, there are no more issues or glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""


They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. The before Memorial day weekend on one trading day before market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close.  Representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 


A link for future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract is at the bottom of the post in DD literature section. It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June, anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 



 -🚀My Positions 🚀 -
As far as my position I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $4.06, I panicked and sold once during February a couple months during the mini bear market and got back in a bit too early so got a wash sale as well 🙈 but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG  (Check out next link below this paragraph, it has My positions with the price chart mentioned above. My screen name on stocktwits is Johnnyknowsbest. Been on there and here since i started with nvaxz feel free and drop a follow if you want up to date info. But honestly the whole board is worth following there's so much good DD on there, we have a really strong tight knit group of longs that help each other with DD. 


Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO, where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June, but he said he thinks it could be earlier.  So sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

“Until further notice, Jefferies Prime Brokerage will no longer offer custody on naked options in GME, AMC and MVIS,” the memo noted. The firm will no longer allow the execution of short sells of those securities, the memo continued, noting that other stocks may be added to that list.

A Jefferies spokesman declined to comment. Street Insider reported the news earlier, citing an unidentified trader.

The news comes a day after the latest meme stock, AMC, closed at a record high of $62.55 after a 95% gain. The stock was down 5% Thursday at 1:37 p.m. New York time.

122,AMC,nnpn9z,2021-05-29 17:21:20,AMC &amp; GME Price Action Comparison before their squeeze,"What's going on y'all

&#x200B;

Just want to share some charts and information that I noticed while comparing AMC and GME before the squeeze

&#x200B;

So as you all know, this past week has been one for the books for AMC, from it's low on Monday, May 24th we witnessed an increase of 201% on AMC. Now this got me thinking and made me want to look back at the history of how GME started to move before it's squeeze.

&#x200B;

If you look at the candles closely, they are very very alot alike

&#x200B;

1. GME's breakout candle, on Thursday, January 13th and AMC's breakout candle, on Wednesday, May 13th are almost identical
2. After both breakouts, they traded above the bollinger bands for 3 back to back sessions
3. After GME's breakout, we saw a consolidation of price action for 5 trading sessions
4. After AMC's breakout we saw a consolidation of price action for 7 trading sessions
5. From GME's low on it's initial breakout to it's high the Friday before the squeeze, we saw on increase of 283%
6. From AMC's low on it's initial breakout to it's high the Friday before the potential squeeze, we saw an increase of 245%

&#x200B;

This is where things get interesting...

&#x200B;

The bullish candle that was formed for GME on Friday, January 22nd looks ALOT like the bullish candle formed on Thursday, May 27th for AMC

The spinning top candle that was formed for GME on Monday, Jan 25th looks alot like the spinning top candle formed on Friday, May 28th for AMC

&#x200B;

Taking into consideration the market is closed on memorial day, is this history repeating itself? If it is, that would mean the squeeze will start next week? Now I don't want to attach certain dates, I'm just sharing more information with you all. You be the judge of it.

Disclaimer: this is not financial advice.

I’m big on studying trends and I believe I have found a 2-3 bagger for you retards. I’ve been following $RIDE for about 2 months now, and I noticed the potential for a short squeeze beginning to form last week. I’ve noticed the propensity to squeeze comes from the following criteria:

* Short % of float must be over 20% ([over 28% of $RIDE’s float is short](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ride); probably closer to 30-32% since it was last updated)
* Small/Mid Cap stocks with considerable growth prospects ($RIDE has a $1.6B market cap) in a hyper-growth EV industry
* Heavily controversial stock, meaning some say it is way overvalued, some say it is undervalued

These stocks tend to be the most volatile. The charts are often comical to even look at (feel free to check out $RIDE’s 6-month chart for reference).

**$MVIS comparison:**

Taking a look at $MVIS, I noticed that Hindenburg research targeted them in a short & distort attack a few months ago.

I actually googled “Hindenburg MVIS” and the second article that popped up was titled “Technically Incompetent Short Seller Hindenburg Makes False Statements About MicroVision.” This bodes very poorly for Hindenburg, as they seem to have started to formulate a lot of their claims out of thin air.

More recently, Hindenburg targeted $RIDE with the same tactics. They called out $RIDE’s pre-orders for their trucks, while almost all EV companies are utilizing pre-orders, this[ has been clear ever since $RIDE went public](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/16/2127140/0/en/Lordstown-Motors-Releases-Business-Updates-Remains-on-Track-to-Begin-Production-of-the-Lordstown-Endurance-in-September-2021.html) last year.

I found a good[ rebuttal post for Hindenburg’s attack on $RIDE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkt7qi/the_bullcase_for_lordstown_motors_corporation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on this sub from not too long ago as well.

**$RIDE Intro:**

Lordstown Motors ($RIDE) is currently developing their [full-size all electric Endurance truck](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/endurance). They have an[ experienced management team](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/corporate-governance/management) with multiple execs from companies like Tesla, Volkswagen, GM, Honda, etc; also, GM’s investment in exchange for their [massive 6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/) helped them hit the ground running. They are targeting commercial fleets and government contracts with their truck initially. Their trucks will be $45,000 after tax credits and get a 75mpg equivalent. They also will require very little maintenance as they utilize true 4 wheel drive with hub motors in each wheel.

Discussing their[ full-year 2020 results](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020) on March 17th, $RIDE management confirmed that “Timeline to Start of Production (SoP) in September 2021 remains on track, with beta prototype build underway and the first beta vehicles to be ready by the end of March; vehicles to be sent for durability, crash, validation, and lighting testing with various partners and to early initial customers for feedback.”

They have[ shown their betas to the public](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1377350607518920705?s=20) as well.

**Ohio’s Endorsement of LMC:** 🚀 🚀 🚀

[U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), a Democrat who represents the Youngstown, OH area and is running for the senate currently, didn’t mince words about the (Hindenburg) short-seller report. He called it “‘bull\*\*\*\*. I mean it was just to me, it seemed like a hatchet job for (short-sellers) to make money,” he said. “And look, I mean (Lordstown) is threatening the status quo. And a lot of people are going to bet against them, figuratively and literally. It comes with the territory. You don’t get to the top of the mountain without a bunch of people trying to drag you down.”

[Secretary of State Frank LaRose](https://www.vindy.com/news/local-news/2021/03/ceo-extols-positives-of-lordstown-motors-on-heels-of-critical-report/): “I think what this is, is an opportunity to take a challenging circumstance from just a few years ago and turn it into a truly unique and amazing opportunity for not right here in the Youngstown area — Voltage Valley as we like to call it — but all over Ohio.”

[Ohio Governor Mike Dewine:](https://www.cleveland.com/open/2020/06/gov-mike-dewine-said-he-expects-success-from-lordstown-plant-in-first-normal-press-conference-during-pandemic.html) “Really, this is the future,” DeWine said of the truck and the facility, where he got a private tour. “I think this truck has a great competitive advantage over its competitors.”

[Senator Michael Rulli](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), the Republican state senator from the area, has introduced several bills in Ohio aimed at helping the electric-vehicle industry, said he’s visited the (Lordstown) plant recently. He said he’s seen the company’s robotic assembly line putting together a series of 57 betas. Based on what he’s seen, Rulli said he thinks Lordstown Motors will be producing thousands of Endurance trucks sometime this year or perhaps early next year. “They’re way way way far along,” he said. “Whoever wrote that article (Hindenburg) has never been in that (Lordstown) plant. That is a fact. Anyone who was in that plant would read that article and think it was garbage.”

**I WILL NOW SCREAM IT FOR ALL OF YOU: ALL OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TO $RIDE’S**[ **MASSIVE 6.2 MILLION SQUARE FOOT FACILITY**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/lordstown-motors-races-to-revive-shuttered-ohio-gm-plant.html)**. $RIDE IS LEGIT AND WILL BE PRODUCING ELECTRIC PICK-UP TRUCKS FOR COMMERCIAL FLEET CUSTOMERS IN JUST 4 MONTHS.**

They also [recently announced “Lordstown Week”](https://businessjournaldaily.com/lordstown-motors-stock-climbs-14-on-lordstown-week-announcement/) in mid June for analysts, customers, partners, and investors to attend. This will silence all of the short-sellers, lawsuits, and FUD.

$RIDE has an earnings call tomorrow 5/24 where they will be giving updates on crash testing. If they announce they are still on track for mass production in September, this will be HUGE.

**$RIDE Upcoming Catalysts include:**

* [Earnings call tomorrow 5/24](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-announces-timing-first-quarter-2021-financial) to discuss updates on crash testing and timeline to production.
* [Department of energy Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (ATVM) loan](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759546/000110465921037690/tm2110022d1_ex99-1.htm), which should be announced by the end of Q2 2021 (literally any day now).
* [Release of ERV in conjunction with Camping World](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2021/01/lordstown-motors-to-reveal-electric-commercial-van-this-summer/), which is expected next month, and the[ Camping World CEO has already leaked a sneak peak](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1379433681995984905?s=20) of it.
* Beta production updates and contracts with commercial fleets.

**Summary:**

$MVIS moved from $10 to $27 in just a couple of days, and I believe $RIDE is about to make a similar move from $10 back to $20+ with their earnings call being tomorrow after-hours.

EVs are front and center, and the government is pushing for the adoption of EVs in such a big way that you’d be a fool not to own a piece of the pie.

$RIDE has one of the lowest market caps out of all of the EV plays, and they are the closest to fully automated mass production (this September).

Position: 5 Jan 2023 calls w/ a $40 strike. I’m planning to buy more tomorrow before earnings.

**TL;DR:**

$RIDE stock has incredibly high upside, and I think it’s only a matter of time until it squeezes back up to the $20’s. I have been following the chart for a while now, and I believe institutions are currently loading up before this gets squeezed back up.

150,BB,nuou81,2021-06-07 23:59:53,Where can BB make it too besides the moon?,"I've been reading the BB tape for months. There is usually a very aggressive daily short position that takes about 20,000-40,000 shares after the open and keeps the price down. It generally stair steps the price down all day. It disappeared on the tape the moment it broke over 10 bucks. My guess is the big guys are ready to let the price start to sore. I doubt the real shorts went anywhere except for shorting at the top of key resistance levels.

If BB Ape buyers keep up the buying then BB could be sitting between extremely high historic levels at 42.49, 68.33, 85.32, AND 124.24 in a manner of weeks/months. Unlike AMC or GME, BB has historic levels to work off. That gives days traders and institutions a guide to trade and they will absolutely make those willing to take the risk a killing as this keeps going to their upper ranges. It will eventually be trading like the Internet of Things/Cyber Security that it is becoming before it monetizes and current buyers will just get in the ground floor and make some decent cash for their investment. When BB comes out showing that it has began to monetize the real accumulation phase will be over because the price will already be trading at the new ranges. Think TSLA, CCIV, etc. They all traded over their values highly and then fell back to earth before going back up. They whipsaw so that the big players can make money off selling high and buying low. Translate screw retail traders that buy high and then think its all over and sell low only to watch it rip again. 

My guess is that the sweet high spot of 85.32 is where BB will head to before a fall  for back to that 68.33 level. It will then  trade in range up towards 85.32 for a while. It will trade in a range for several months or up to a year or so before a rip beyond 85 to around the all time highs mentioned above as this becomes the new accumulation phase. The Prem Watsa's (Warren Buffett of Canada) will get BB to somewhere between the 70 and 80s before stepping off the gas and letting the shares fall back to no lower than the 20s-30s so they can acquire them again at a discount. Their motto is buy wholesale and sale retail. That is exactly what they did after the January surge. They bought every share they could at a discount and of course they sold some in the 10-20 range and will just buy more.

Good news for some of you on the PLTR earnings report. I suppose you'll be interested in knowing what happened to the stock.

https://preview.redd.it/qwsurb22tky61.jpg?width=1057&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=093e0d476e651e4bcece86ae9f8b96238e4a374a

Here we see some squiggles. It shows that the stock's underlying price movement is becoming less influenced by Gamma and more by \*insert hand waves\* other factors. What other factors? Wouldn't you like to know. But typically gamma is healthy so I wonder if the other factors are less so.

So then we look at the short interest volume. With such a large price jump - did people increase short selling or decrease? Were these shorts a part of options dealings? Were they MM shorting in the dark market? Who knows.

https://preview.redd.it/u9vivncftky61.jpg?width=1069&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da7488cc42dde49754c6ba599ac23cb6c33dcf11

Slight increase but I wouldn't say uber substantial. But it definitely isn't a decrease.

Looking at the options:

https://preview.redd.it/pk3sz1mqtky61.jpg?width=1049&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b44948c90a0f58bd3122e7f15d1f45cfef5fe27c

With a larger-than-expected increase in price, lots of options switched hands, mainly at the $20 at which \~150,000 calls became ITM and \~200,000 puts became OTM. Oof to those bag holders.

But the real interest is in how the options landscape changed. Yesterday's options:/

https://preview.redd.it/hbdu3y31uky61.jpg?width=1047&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ccca5e3d569161e72bccbc00112a259a570487d2

Accounting for the switching of ITM/OTM you'll see a decent increase in calls (\~160k) and puts (\~118k). Since overall delta exposure doubled towards zero it can be said that the majority of those were dealer long and customer short. This is healthy behavior. Considering volatility dropped as well, this suggests continued upside. 

It seems as though the healthy earnings report re-vitalized the stock. There is still rocky ground, however, there may be resistance at $20 but with increased liquidity and stabilizing gamma, there is an argument to be made that it should go beyond. 

The caveat is that if there is downside if it starts causing liquidity issues again the stock may continue its previous trajectory until the options landscape changes more drastically. With okayish accuracy, you can see with increase in volatility, 1.6mil options will have to be hedged via purchasing underlying with 1.8mil via selling. So back to the 1.6:1.8 as before. (For those wondering, did the decrease in volatility today help the stock rise with 1.6million options needing hedging via purchasing with decrease in vol? or was it the prospect of tendies. Lemme know).

TL;DR: You deserve your tendies today but dont let them get cold.",DD,0.79

170,RNG,nthp3b,2021-06-06 11:11:28,"DD RNG potential if compared with Hydrogen &amp; BEVs, USA (California) regulatory and legislative focus","Hello everyone, 

here a DD focused on RNG and Natural Gas developments in the USA, as previous one was more broad and had the intention to outline the state of the industry worldwide.

As you may know, California has always been at the center of attention as the most advanced state in terms of decarbonization efforts. Yet, it seems that not all decisions paid back in terms of quality of life and certainty of business activity.

**Californian** **Natural Gas power plants shut down, electricity imported from other states:**

Indeed, California, different from what someone would expect, has not a good and reliable supply of electricity, probably because it pushed too aggressively for the state's 100% electrification goal (see attached picture). During the most recent blackout in August 2020, some Electric buses were forced to shut down, in order to reduce electricity demand. In the next decade, virtual power plants' alike experiments will be more popular, therefore it is reasonable to expect a better match between the demand & supply of green electricity. But it will take time and for safety reasons, it would be better to rely on different sources of energy.

* [2020-08-21 Washington Examiner: California forced to defend green goals amid blackouts](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/california-forced-to-defend-green-goals-amid-blackouts)
* [2020-08-23 Oil & Gas 360 : Green California has the nation's worst power grid](https://www.oilandgas360.com/green-california-has-the-nations-worst-power-grid/)

The first question that arises, reading these topics, is about the never-ending announcements of companies like Nikola $NKLA (very dubious business potential) and Tesla $TSLA (amazing company with incredible potential) about the incoming, quick and easy electrification of Heavy Duty Transports.

**Hydrogen Alternative Focus**

Nikola revealed its lack of technological breakthrough when it was revealed that General Motors had the intention to market a Hydrogen trucks with the Nikola brand and...... GM Fuel Cells!! The drama related to the CEO trials made the rest. I am a huge fan of hydrogen , but as Cummins $CMI CEO confirmed, hydrogen trucks have a long long way to go before being adopted on a large scale (please note that [Cummins acquired Hydrogenics in Sept. 2019](https://www.cummins.com/news/releases/2019/09/09/cummins-closes-its-acquisition-hydrogenics) (second global leader after $BLDP in hydrogen fuel cells). According to Cummins and others, in the next years electrolyzer segment will grow first. Note that the hydrogen fuel needed for hypothetical trucks on California's road would need green hydrogen, thus it will put more stress on the grid.. Even if it is not focused on the US, I recommend readers this report of David Fickling about global green hydrogen potential by 2050. 

[According to David Fickling](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/the-hydrogen-economys-time-is-approaching/2020/05/08/383b1a04-9191-11ea-9322-a29e75effc93_story.html), hydrogen could meet 24% of the world’s energy needs by 2050, but it would likely take 31’320 TWh of electricity to hit this level. Last year, the entire world generated just roughly 26’000 TWh, of which 10’000 were coming from zero-carbon sources. By 2050 it may be achievable, but there are shorter deadlines for the transport sector. Actions today are required to match 2025 and 2030 emission targets.

If we want a high percentage of **green hydrogen**, a huge amount of grid investments is required today; high-tension grid infrastructure needs 5-10 years to be completed, therefore it is reasonable to say that hydrogen will be a sound reality for mobility from the late 2020’s on, not earlier. In addition, the potential of exhausted salt mines that could store hydrogen for months is just theoretical for now.

It is worth to remember that the sources for electricity generation in Europe are diversified and are not ready for a 100% renewable energy scenario:

* **Germany renounced to nuclear power** in 2011 and will renounce to coal by 2030, and the country is massively investing in gas pipelines, so it is very likely that it will not renounce to Russian gas.
* **France relies heavily on nuclear power**, with some of these power plants being soon too old to remain active. Therefore, traditional gas generation will be a  likely alternative to overcome this problem.
* **The UK closed all its coal power plants** but decided to keep open nuclear and gas facilities.
* **Italy** relies heavily on gas and does not have any nuclear power plant.

None of Europe’s largest countries can afford a 100% green electricity sector that can satisfy both current demand plus the incremental demand coming from the green hydrogen sector. Therefore, some fossil fuel (natural gas) and nuclear plants are here to stay for the longer term.

**BLUE HYDROGEN CANNOT BE IGNORED -** The argument is different if we include in the discussion blue hydrogen along with carbon capture. In this scenario, we would need massive incentives and research investments in carbon capture technology, which now are still at an early stage. According to the European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen, [who spoke at the World Economic Forum in January 2020](https://www.ft.com/content/c93694c8-3d15-11ea-a01a-bae547046735), the EU will define the structure of a continental carbon tax by the end of this year (pre-COVID-19 intention, very likely now that the details will be published in 2021). For this reason, large trade partners like the US and China were advised to start their own studies on the tax, if they do not want their goods to be taxed at the highest possible carbon emission rate.

**HYDROGEN TRAIN FOCUS** \- An interesting case in this regard is the Hydrogen train developed by Alstom and Hydrogenics (now Cummins Inc.) whose adoption has been delayed considerably. Alstom was able to sell its innovative product to some German and French regions. Nevertheless, in most of the cases hydrogen will come from fossil sources (Rhyne region etc.), with cleaner alternatives being provided at a later stage. In the region of Schleswig Holstein, where the green potential was massive, Alstom could have got the greatest commercial order for a hydrogen product worldwide; however, the green fueling station was at the heart of a controversy between the company and the tender offer authorities of Schleswig-Holstein. For this reason, 52 trains were allocated to the battery train manufacturer and the Alstom (Hydrogenics) & NEL consortium lost the tender offer. The proposed fueling station was massive for the time, being around 20 MW capacity, [but the cost of it was at the expense of the consortium](https://www.ln-online.de/Lokales/Lauenburg/Aus-fuer-die-Wasserstoffzelle-auf-der-Schiene).

**BEV Infrastructure focus**

Tesla instead kept postponing the launch of its Tesla SEMI. You can read again the last conference call transcripts which clearly states that the biggest issue from a product perspective is the fast charger technology, whose time of realization and commercialization is yet unknown. From a macro perspective instead is unclear how California may afford to charge thousands of Tesla SEMI with its current electricity grid.

**How does $CLNE fits into all this?**

 If you look at 2020 Q2 CC of $CLNE , management made a quite useful comparison for H2 fueling stations and BEV charging stations for heavy-duty. They told the story of a recharging facility in Los Angeles that was going to be built for $5.5 million to recharge 24 heavy-duty trucks in a day’s time, in like 20-hour time, using the equivalent of the electricity needed for 44’000 homes (!!!). Thus, it is reasonable to expect not many fleet operators to switch soon to BEV trucks. 

About hydrogen refueling, management commented on the experience they got operating a hydrogen station in California with on-site hydrogen generation through electrolysis:

“*Get a load of this, it requires about 20 gallons of water (each gallon is 3.785 liters) for every gallon of hydrogen you produce. So march that out on a nationwide scale. And the idea that we're going to do it with renewable sources at a station is going to be very daunting, okay?*

*I think that as you look at commercial truck stops with hydrogen, you're probably looking at something on the order of $15 million to $20 million, or more, per station. So this is a very expensive proposition because you're basically creating a whole new network. And really, the most successful stations around the world, and there's only a handful of hydrogen, is you're reforming natural gas.”*

It is clear why some fleet operators are switching to Natural Gas Trucks. Amazon in February and the Port of LA recently, with the decision to equate BEV and other Zero Emission trucks to the Natural Gas ones. 

**US Congress ""Californification"" , not so fast**

In the past legislative period, there were some bipartisan attempts to support RNG and Natural Gas mobility. US Congress has indeed shown some interest in the subject. Last June, a bipartisan effort was introduced in both the chambers of the US congress. The bill is called “[Growing Climate Solutions Act](https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/09/10/growing-climate-solutions-act-gives-farmers-a-seat-at-the-carbon-market-table/)” and would allow farmers to generate revenue streams from different forms of carbon capture. Most notably, methane from livestock is mentioned in the legislation. If enacted at  the federal level, decarbonized gas would receive a renovated interest from many different stakeholders. [Being a bipartisan deal](https://www.audubon.org/news/indiana-senator-mike-braun-discusses-bipartisan-climate-solutions-young-leaders), as farmers represent a prized electoral category, it should be enacted regardless of the next election results.

President Biden needs to show to his party and the American people that he is doing something about the environment. That is why he advertised the Ford BEV pickup and keeps saying that government's fleets will be electrified. As always, the political reality is much more complex than the headline announcements, and RNG has a lot of room to grow in this space. 

[Already in 2020, RNG represented 53% of all Natural Gas used in transport in the USA](https://bioenergyinternational.com/markets-finance/rng-surpassed-ng-accounting-for-53-percent-of-us-on-road-ngv-fuel-use-in-2020) . As noted in a previous DD, in California RNG is 90% of NG used in transport.

Let me know if you have further questions!

174,BYND,noprc0,2021-05-31 03:54:08,BYND,"The case for BYND

Improving fundamentals: It just received a double upgrade and now has two consecutive analyst upgrades. The total addressable market for BYND is potentially in the trillions of dollars: displacing animal-based beef, pork, eggs, cheese, and chicken. The World Economic Forum has argued that global meat consumption must fall within the coming years. According to Forbes, 60% of Gen Z is looking to base their diets on “plant-forward” foods. 

BYND market cap’s only $10 billion. It’s growing like a weed. Yearly revenue growth for the past three is 131% compounded annually.  

And BYND might have a durable competitive advantage. According to analyst Alexia Howard, for BYND, “as plant-based products tend to be relatively complex to manufacture, moats could prove to be deep.” Additionally, as of 2019, the company had one patent and 21 U.S. and international patent applications.  

It’s attempting to achieve price parity with animal-based meat in the next few years and ultimately even produce for cheaper. As the first-mover, it also has the potential to achieve economies of scale faster and become most attractive from a price standpoint. Its competitor Impossible Burger has had to turn down partnerships because it hasn’t had the infrastructure that BYND has and couldn’t produce sufficient product to service big partnerships. BYND’s further along and has been able to garner partnerships with the likes of KFC, McDonald’s, Starbucks, Pepsi, Pizza Hut. Impossible Burger also produces its food with GMOs, which are outlawed in many countries. BYND already sells products in 80 countries.  

Remember that the GME run started in 2020 with not only high short interest but attractiveness from a fundamental perspective that led big investors like Michael Burry and Ryan Cohen to move in aggressively. BYND has this fundamental attractiveness more than a lot of companies with a high short interest, which analysts are largely downrating.  

BYND’s growth took more of a pandemic-related hit than other food providers because much of its growth involves people buying their products in restaurants. It is, therefore, considered a re-opening play. 

BYND spends 7% of revenue on R&D, which is many times that of more mature food providers, so the future looks bright. 

High short interest: According to both MarketWatch and Ortex, BYND’s short interest is higher than AMC, BB, and GME. 

Favorable externalities: Good against global warming, good for animals, good for global resources, good for human health. This gives incentives to many influentials (celebrities, governments) to encourage people to consume plant-based meat. Governments have subsidized the electric vehicle industry. Will they do the same for clean meat?  

Cramer has suggested BYND as a WSB play to his 250,000 viewers during each of his last three Mad Money episodes (Tues, Weds, Thurs; no show Fri) and elsewhere on CNBC. A couple people here have suggested Cramer has done so as a distraction. I understand the bitterness toward hedge funds: They’re selling out, making a lot of money while not adding much to society. But Cramer’s offering insight to nonprofessional investors to help them make investing decisions. I just started watching Cramer again about a month ago and just about everything he’s liked most has moved up in value: Roblox, Ford, Wells Fargo. He has, in the past, consistently said favorable things about BYND and Ethan Brown. He’s even suggested in the past that going against BYND is going against history. 

And anyway, the proof is in the pudding: BYND short interest is higher than AMC, BB, and GME, according to MarketWatch and Ortex. And it would be a lot nicer for a company displacing animal meat to sell stock and get more capital for R&D than a cell phone or a movie theater company. 

I was following the market in 2013, and this situation reminds me so much of Tesla in May 2013. The stock started rising on fundamentals, and commentators thought it was highly priced and thought it was rising only due to a short squeeze. But electric vehicles were the future and Tesla kept rising for years, even though there was concern that big players would get into the industry. Beyond Meat is also the future and has the potential to rise even after the short squeeze, which is one reason institutional investors may be buying. BYND’s market cap of about $10 billion is also the same as Tesla’s when its run started in 2013 and commentators were scoffing at its valuation. Now it’s over $600 billion. 

This stock right now is potentially set up for a  strong run within the next few months: increasing bullishness of institutional investors, high short interest, and maybe the increasing support of WSB. It’s 40% below its all-time high. I wouldn’t be surprised if it doubles in the next several months.  

Disclaimer: I’m not in any other squeeze plays. I will probably write covered calls on AMC and hedge with puts because their short-term calls are very highly priced. (This is a delta-neutral position that should not impact AMC share price.) I have BYND calls and may buy more because their short-term calls are still cheap.",DD,0.71

182,UWMC,ndcm0p,2021-05-16 02:39:04,"UWMC is a powderkeg: low float, high short, huge buyback, unhedged options (Consolidated DD)","I'm sure you've all seen some of this in various threads over the last few days so here is what I see as the complete short term case for UWMC in one place. Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor this is not advice don't listen to me etc.

Before the content let me say I'm not going to talk about the [fundamentals of this company](https://www.reddit.com/r/MillennialBets/comments/n0414o/uwmc_a_fundamental_analysis_of_why_this_stock_is/) today (they're great), [the value even with no short-term price movement](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nd9hyr/uwm_holdings_looks_like_a_value_bargain_with_low/), [a super good dividend](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/ndc6pu/united_wholesale_mortgage_uwmc_is_the_most/), [the wild housing market](https://the1a.org/segments/housing-pandemic-market/), [the great strategic decisions the company has made](https://twitter.com/SleipnirPerkins/status/1378305915800186884), or anything other than strictly the stock. I like the company, but I love the stock.

&#x200B;

* **Low float, low volume**

UWM has 1.6 billion total shares, but 1.5 billion of them are owned by the CEO and not traded. The Class A shares outstanding are 103million, with \~13million owned by insiders. That's a 90 million public float, with another 25.5million in institutional ownership. Institutions can sell, of course, but a lot of this ownership is large conservative firms that aren't day trading this stock. (Pension funds, Vanguard, etc.). I would estimate the actual ""active"" float at less than 70 million.

Average daily volume is very low - volume Friday was 4 million, and there have been recent days with volume south of 2 million. The last time volume was more than 20 million was the first week of March, and look what happened to the stock. (Spoiler: it ran up to 12.50) If this stock gets real sustained volume, it can and will fly.

&#x200B;

* **Short interest, high short volume**

In the post-GME world we just aren't going to see short interests over 100% anymore - the highest on the market right now is 40-50% in Pubmatic and Root. But the shorts aren't gone, they're just more sneaky. The official Short interest over the last two months has been in the moderate zone, a bit below 20% of the active float. 

Short interest through May 15 won't be available until the 25th, but short volume has spiked since RKT's disappointing earnings took the stock down to ATLs. In fact over 50% of the volume on 6 of the last 7 trading days was short sales. ([Source](http://shortvolumes.com/?t=uwmc)) The shorts are here and they are relentless.

&#x200B;

* **Short Fee Spike, low short shares available, failure to settle**

Last Monday, there were up to 400,000 short shares available with about 3% interest. **Right now the short fees are around (or over) 100% with almost zero shares available to short.** ([Source](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/uwmc)) It's [over 300%](https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_330645419.jpg) on Ortex. This is the same pattern that was seen in AMC last week, RKT in March, and other stocks that have had rapid runs.

Regarding naked shorting and FTS - It's happening, and it's significant. UWMC has been on the threshold securities list for 12 straight trading days. I'll [let the recent post on this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ncczh8/uwmc_on_nyse_threshold_securities_list_regulation/) speak for itself and not explain this again except to say the official FTS data is only available with a 1-month lag so recent hard numbers aren't available.

&#x200B;

* **Huge Buyback**

Monday during earnings, UWM announced they will be buying back **$300 million** **in stock** over the next 2 years, starting this week. At the Friday closing price of 7.51, that's about 42.5 million shares, or **half of the active float** of the stock. Disclaimers: 1) they can only use about half the money (21 million shares) before the public shares become too low to be considered in the Russell 1000, which the CEO has said he wants next month. 2) They have 2 years to spend the money. But, they have every incentive to strike quickly due to the cheap stock price (and the CEO has said as much). 3) There are legal limits on daily buybacks equal to 25% of the average daily volume of the stock - 7M right now, so a limit of 1.75M shares per day. That's still a huge, huge potential amount though.

What does this mean, in effect? Besides the obvious buy pressure and lowering of outstanding shares, **incredible uncertainty and risk for anyone now shorting the stock.** It's tough to go heavily short when a million-share buy order could be coming in at any time. 

There's no way to know when buybacks are happening, but  there was a suspiciously big buy on Wednesday afternoon at about 1:45pm. Based on this and [public statements from the CEO](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nclll1/uwmc_the_most_important_statement_for_all_shares/), It's safe to say that the buybacks are actually happening now and not theoretical.

&#x200B;

* **Options - Would you look at that**

This is where it get juicy. The options interest on this stock is massive, especially on next week's 5/21 expiry. **Between the $7.5 and $15 strikes, there are 205,500 open call contracts expiring next Friday. That's 20.5 million shares if they are all exercised. Most importantly,** the average delta of these options is currently about 0.1 **-** meaning the big Market Makers are only 10% covered on the shares**.** The 9, 10, and 12.50 strikes each by themselves all have open interest near to or greater than the entire daily volume of the stock on most days! 

As for puts, above 7.5, there are almost no (<5000) open puts expiring.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion -** What needs to happen

First, this needs to sustain above $7.5. The stock spent most of the day last Friday banging against a 300k share Ask wall at $7.5, and finally broke it at close (and climbed AH!). This was huge and encouraging, but I am 100% sure the shorts and option MMs will be back to try to pin it at 7.5 all week long. (Tangent: go look at what happened on April 16, the last options expiry date. it closed at 7.49 on the dot, wiping out everyone's options on both sides.)

Second this needs to get to, and through, $9. Once the price approaches and breaks $9, Delta is going to force the MMs to buy shares to cover their contracts. And once the price momentum breaks to the rapid upside through the $9, $10, $11, and $12.5 strikes, there are 12 million short shares that will need covering. 

It's not quite a pure gamma squeeze, and it's not a pure short squeeze, but there's elements of both here and it's all converging this week.

**TL;DR:** This stock has a low active float, a whole bunch of shorts, and a huge amount of unhedged calls expiring on Friday. All in the midst of a gigantic share buyback.  The conditions are perfect for a huge run.",DD,0.85

However this is straight from the horses mouth from a Ford Dealership in Canada. They clearly state and clarify this partnership directly on their dealership website. Information I have just come across today.

[https://www.rivercityford.ca/xl-hybrids/](https://www.rivercityford.ca/xl-hybrids/)

What's more is in their latest today that have opened a new Centre in MI today again stating that it's where Ford and GM cars will become electrified.

[https://twitter.com/xlfleet/status/1402634437083471883?s=21](https://twitter.com/xlfleet/status/1402634437083471883?s=21)

I've been watching the level 2 for days and every time volume dries up it's being accumulating. In my opinion they are simply messing with the price.

If you want to read their investors presentation see below.

[https://xlfleet.com/assets/Uploads/PDF/Updated-Investor-Presentation-9.21.20.pdf](https://xlfleet.com/assets/Uploads/PDF/Updated-Investor-Presentation-9.21.20.pdf)

What a lot of people are missing about $XL is they have fingers in every sector of the EV market. 

They have substantial cash reserves of $400,000,000 roughly 1/3 of their market cap so there is no immediate requirement for cash.

**Please read full DD bullet points below:**

**Basic Stats:**

Market Cap: $1b

Public Float 94.4m

Shares Short: 22.11M

Share Float Short: 23.3%

32 days of consolidation at lows meaning an extremely strong base has been put in at this price. Everybody has been shorting during this period is now trapped.

Vanguard loaded up 6,000,000 extra shares with some other funds increasing their positions.

Possible entry into the Russel Index which would see far more cash flow into the name.

On the 26th March 2021 a total of 205,641 shares were awarded to employees at an estimated cost price of $6.81; With a one year lock up. Giving them a massive incentive to hit targets.

XL recently bought WEES in a 50/50 cash and stock deal which again in my opinion is a great buy. World Energy generated $18 million in total revenue and was free cash flow positive for full year 2020. Its acquisition, which closed Monday, is expected to expand XL Fleet’s electric vehicle charging infrastructure capabilities, the company said

XL recently inked a deal with UBS arena to provide charging stations, solar generation and energy storage. For a total of 1,000 charging stations which is one of the largest deployments in the United States.

The company they inked the deal with also owns another 30 properties. Meaning more contracts is a very likely outcome.

They also announced that to cover their current clients who consist of names like Fedex, Coca Cola, Pepsi etc they would need to install over 100,000 charging stations making them the biggest player in the industry.

100's of millions sitting in cash

Finally a Short Float of 23.3% approx 22,000,000 shares short. For a comparison this is more than $AMC and $BB.

The market cap and share float are so small that the room for an explosive move is enormous.

Great setup but keeps getting dragged under the breakout

Volume increasing steadily - uptrend is still intact

There aren't a lot of great levels to play off of right here - so **look for a candle close** (1h, 2h, 1D - up to you, each is a better signal than the one before) **above 11.47 to enter** and use that as support

Some resistance at **12.11**, but should target **14.12** at least - above there **15.72, 17.31**

\---

Don't know where all the hype for this stock went - but it has a nice setup so I thought I'd share.

[$CLNE 1Y 1D](https://preview.redd.it/knx94mwsw3471.png?width=2224&format=png&auto=webp&s=817708ac80814cefd26c55bda41979bb0969aa4e)

It's a large falling wedge going back to February. It has tried to break out 3 times in the past 3 trading days and keeps failing. There **aren't a lot of levels near the breakout point** \- which is a major thing I look for. You need support to play off of on the long side - and confluence generates better signals. This is probably why it keeps dropping back in.

However - volume is steadily increasing in an uptrend  (positions are changing hands) - and I've noticed a trend of tickers flooding the front page --> seemingly being forgotten about --> pumping 200% a week later - so **I'm keeping a close eye on this one.**

The nearest level - and a great one at that - above the breakout point is at **11.47 -** it will be resistance at first but once we clear it, great support. I'm looking for an hourly candle close above to enter - and I'll add more on a 2 hour close, followed by a 1 day close. Options chain is actually pretty solid so looking at Julys.

Targets/resistances above are **12.11, 14.12, 15.72, 17.31 -** each should become support after we close above it.

Who else picked up some juicy berries?

As I already stated with the last chart update - the former 12$ resistance is the make or break area for the bull case which was finally confirmed yesterday. After the shorts won on Friday 28th May, the bulls took over now. 

Furthermore the **predicted spike above 12$** occured. The huge volume is a very bullish indicator and suggests a further acceleration of the uptrend. The next price target is around 25$. 

A pullback to the resistance at 12$ is not a bad sign. In most cases a minor correction is a healthy feature of a trend. Adding at this point might be an appealing opportunity for new investors. A stop loss below the support of 12$ reduces the risk and provides a good risk/reward.

Academy Sports and Outdoors (ASO🚀🚀🚀)  is a brick and mortar Sporting Goods and Outdoor retailer that is CRIMINALLY Undervalued right now. They have a Strong Buy Rating on Yahoo Finance with an Estimated 100% return on tendies. Additionally they have a Strong Buy Rating from Zach's.  I believe their upcoming earnings 6/8 will be monumental and they should be delivering a brinks truck to your driveway...

**Recent Events**

ASO just recently paid down over 99Million Dollars in debt. This will save them an estimated per year 9Million on interest alone. In Addition the S&P Global has increased their credit rating to a B+ from originally a B.  Academy has been trimming the fat and becoming more lean in the retail space--setting themselves up to deleverage debt and enhance growth opportunities.

Currently they are trading at a P/E Ratio of 10.72, this represents a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 14.98. 

**Competitors**

Dicks is one of ASO's largest competitors. During their earnings report they announced a crushing of earnings, this is resulting from primarily their ecommerce, in store purchases opening up and yes you guessed it, GUNS. Their share price after earnings announcement jumped from roughly $84 to $98. I see ASO moving in a similar pattern, expecting to CRUSH earnings with ammo, guns, retail, and ecommerce trading. With the pandemic in the rearview, anecdotally I was in there this past weekend, and grills, outdoor gear, and other items were flying off the shelves.

**Short Squeeze? (jk)**

One thing that is interesting is according to Yahoo Finance the Short % of Float is 26.06% with 93% of Shares held by institutions. (Melvin?)

**TLDR**

Academy Sports and Outdoors (ASO) is undervalued in terms of fundamentals, I believe this next week's earnings report lead to all signs of them crushing it, which will in turn make Apes rich and those shorts eat shite.

201,DD,nw6lmm,2021-06-09 23:16:51,A quick DD on CLOV borrowing fee,"Since I saw a lot of misinformed comments in the daily threads, I figured I would share this information.

The current borrow fee rate for CLOV is 116.7% (https://iborrowdesk.com/report/clov). The borrow fee rate is not the short interest; that is the number of shares shorted. 

The borrow fee rate is the amount it costs per year to short a share, as shorting requires borrowing. To put it into perspective, for a costant price, a yearly borrow fee rate of 116.7% would imply a daily cost of paying 0.3197% of the value of the shorted share.

0.32% in the world of returns is a lot. 

Yesterday, the short interest rate on CLOV was 43.54% (https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1402368431291314177?s=20). This number might be lower now, as the borrowing fee rate depends on other factors (volatility, ease of locating shares) than just the supply available; shorts may have covered a bit. It will, however, not be a lot lower. What this implies is that for some 30%-50% of the number of shares available on CLOV, the shorts are paying 0.32% of the price of the share just for holding the position, every. single. day. 

The shorts are absolutely bleeding buckets. In fact, this situation, including the drop today, is incredibly similar to GME; I dare say even more so than AMC. Another great buy, support each other please.

I currently hold multiple call options comprising 19% of my portfolio, and that's only because GME takes up 60%.

Obligatory rocket emojis 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Edit: Since I made this thread I received a lot of good, confirming information, which I would like to summarize here:

- The short interest rate is currently at 50.42% according to Ortex.

- https://fintel.io/shortSqueeze model states CLOV is currently most likely to squeeze.

- questrade Canada also has a borrow fee of 59%.

- Additionally https://www.shortsight.com/ shows that CLOV has a bullish sentiment with a low share availability score of 4, meaning shares are confirmed really limited across the board. This means multiple brokerages are confirmed to have a hard time locating shares. That is huge. Remember what caused GME to not be allowed to be bought anymore? Borrowing fee rates were high for a ton of brokers, and some, including IBKR and Robinhood, had these high borrowing rates in place because they were running out of shares to locate. They could no longer provide the shares they are obligated to provide to those who either want to short or buy the share. And hence they shut both down, as otherwise the brokerages themselves would trigger an insane and instant shortsqueeze. An incredible indicator.

213,UWMC,nw121b,2021-06-09 19:15:07,UWMC will squeeze,"$UWMC will squeeze for the following reasons:
1. Major shareholders have zero intention to sell as the company is extremely profitable and they even issued a $300M share buyback program that started in May 21.
2. Long holders will not sell, the stock is issuing a 4%+ dividend on July 6th and most of that will probably be auto-reinvested into the stock.  The company has Triple digit YOY growth and q1 2021 was the best ever.
3. There is a 22% short interest on float.  This is extremely high on a profitable company.
4.  The real reason this will squeeze is because the cost to borrow is a staggering 38%. Together with the love from long holders, the $300m share buyback program and high interest on every single stock message board, this is looking to be the absolutely best squeeze possibility. 

In fact Fintel has UWMC at a higher squeeze score than even CLOV.  We all saw what CLOV did.  Get in UWMC and make the dream come true.

EDIT with some stats for newcomers to UWMC:
146% YOY Revenue Growth
136% YOY Income Growth
+253% Operating Income

UWMC is the nations #1 wholesale mortgage lender based out of Michigan. They have a variety of advantages over their competitors in the mortgage field. 
I understand a lot of people are trying to move the sub away from chasing short squeezes, however it is worth nothing that this stock is sitting at 20.5% short interest and the borrow rate is quite high https://iborrowdesk.com/report/uwmc .

218,GME,nnpn9z,2021-05-29 17:21:20,AMC &amp; GME Price Action Comparison before their squeeze,"What's going on y'all

&#x200B;

Just want to share some charts and information that I noticed while comparing AMC and GME before the squeeze

&#x200B;

So as you all know, this past week has been one for the books for AMC, from it's low on Monday, May 24th we witnessed an increase of 201% on AMC. Now this got me thinking and made me want to look back at the history of how GME started to move before it's squeeze.

&#x200B;

If you look at the candles closely, they are very very alot alike

&#x200B;

1. GME's breakout candle, on Thursday, January 13th and AMC's breakout candle, on Wednesday, May 13th are almost identical
2. After both breakouts, they traded above the bollinger bands for 3 back to back sessions
3. After GME's breakout, we saw a consolidation of price action for 5 trading sessions
4. After AMC's breakout we saw a consolidation of price action for 7 trading sessions
5. From GME's low on it's initial breakout to it's high the Friday before the squeeze, we saw on increase of 283%
6. From AMC's low on it's initial breakout to it's high the Friday before the potential squeeze, we saw an increase of 245%

&#x200B;

This is where things get interesting...

&#x200B;

The bullish candle that was formed for GME on Friday, January 22nd looks ALOT like the bullish candle formed on Thursday, May 27th for AMC

The spinning top candle that was formed for GME on Monday, Jan 25th looks alot like the spinning top candle formed on Friday, May 28th for AMC

&#x200B;

Taking into consideration the market is closed on memorial day, is this history repeating itself? If it is, that would mean the squeeze will start next week? Now I don't want to attach certain dates, I'm just sharing more information with you all. You be the judge of it.

In accordance with Russell US ground rules, the reconstitution of the Russell US Indexes will take place after the market close on 25 June 2021. Performed annually, reconstitution ensures that the Russell US indexes continue to accurately reflect the current state of the US equity market and its market segments, including market capitalization (e.g., large and small cap), sector breakdowns, and style structure.

&#x200B;

# Timetable:

**Friday 07 May 2021:** Rank day. Russell US Index membership eligibility for the 2021 reconstitution is determined from published information and market capitalizations at market close.

&#x200B;

**Friday 04 June 2021:** Preliminary membership lists are published after market close. **This is the catalyst.**

&#x200B;

**Friday 21 May to Friday 11 June 2021:** Query period. Users are welcome to query the published data; any corrections will be communicated after market close each day. Merger and spin-off companies will be re-ranked when the transaction is effective between the rank day and the index lock-down. No further re-ranking will occur after.

&#x200B;

**Friday 11 June 2021. Monday 14 June 2021:** **Lock-down.** No further corrections will be implemented\* and the Russell US index reconstitution can be considered final (with any further changes to shares and free float isolated to changes associated with corporate events).

I want to talk about some other information on this stock. If the squeeze doesn't work out then it's good to hold an undervalued (at current prices) stock right?

**Valuation:**

Earning is negative as they are still heavily spending and growing

P/S of 1.67 (as of 6/7 closing) is industry low, suggesting that they are undervalued (compared to AMZN 3.82, BABA 5.2, PDD 13.8, EBAY 3.92, ETSY 10.54, W 2.27)

**numbers from the latest** [8-k](https://sec.report/Document/0001157523-21-000651/) **and** [10-q](https://sec.report/Document/0001564590-21-027024/)**:**

Revenue $772m, up 70% Q/Q. Wish is spending heavily on sales and marketing, $470m last quarter (61% of revenue). They have been consistently spending \~60% to 70% of revenue on sales and marketing, and they anticipate reducing this to 40-45%, at which point they will likely be profitable. Comparing to ETSY for example, ETSY is only spending $151m out of $551m revenue (27%) last quarter. Of course ETSY is in the black - they are just not spending as much to grow. Meanwhile ETSY has a $21.6B valuation on $2B sales compared to WISH's $5B valuation on $2.87B sales.

One of the concerns cited by analysts is the drop in monthly active users (MAUs) from 109m to 101m Q/Q. The explanation given by WISH is that they decided to de-emphasize in emerging markets due to logistic issues during the pandemic. But I anticipate that they will ramp back up. For example [WISH recently partner with the south african postal services](https://www.businessinsider.co.za/global-online-store-wish-has-struck-a-deal-with-the-sa-post-office-to-deliver-products-faster-2021-4), indicating that they are going back to growth in emerging markets.

**Balance book:**

WISH has $1.6B cash. \~$2B total assets, \~$1.1B total liabilities, giving $930m equity.  For a growth company these numbers are excellent. Again comparing to ETSY, $1.16B cash, $2.5B total assets, $1.8B total liabilities, $684m equity. 

**Insider selling:**

Another concern that a lot of people have is the amount of insider selling. First of all, it's normal for insiders to cash out for a new IPO company like this. This is certainly done with scheduled sales - they wouldn't want to sell at like 30% of IPO prices either but they couldn't change the scheduled sales. This on top of short seller has driven the prices to <50% of IPO prices, <30% of ATH. I think the insiders would certainly be reconsidering their next selling schedules, and we may see less selling pressure.

**Technicals:**

Again, the stock is near all time low, and at <50% of IPO prices, <30% of ATH. The spike today poked out of a descending wedge and a breakout looks very promising.

**Conclusions:**

From a pure price point of view, it's an excellent entry point into WISH, even after today's spike. I think this is a low risk, high reward play at it's current price. In the bull case, WISH gets a valuation similar to ETSY, and that would make WISH have a market cap of $25B for a share price of $40. For the bear case, I don't see how WISH can drop much more. Let's say it goes to $5, that would make it have a market cap of $3B with a P/S of \~1, and that would be absurd.",DD,0.74

250,CLOV,nv6onb,2021-06-08 17:35:17,CLOV - Has the potential to Gamma Squeeze and Short Squeeze,"Hi Apes,

I want to keep this short and simple. CLOV is a great company that is in the health and tech sector (Healthcare technology company). They provide a real solution as a business.

1). This stock is shorted at 39.36%+, as per Ortex.

2). It's going to be included in the Russell Index, this means shares will be purchased by the Russell index as it'll now be included.

3). A lot of call options have been bought on the stock and a Gamma Squeeze is in the works as we speak.

4). CLOV is one of the highest shorted stocks on the market at the moment. I believe only a handful have more short interest than CLOV.

5). There's a very real possibility of a Gamma Squeeze + Short Squeeze combo to take affect on this stock if it continues to rally and investors hold.

Large Volume + SI% [If price is maintained or increases, over time shorts will have to cover] + Gamma Ramma = Nice Price.

There's a lot of DD on this company for those who don't know what CLOV does as a business.

As mentioned in my original post yesterday, I believe this stock has the perfect setup to flourish like GME and AMC have.

As seen by a recent post here that has been gaining traction, $CLF is a ticking time bomb of fundamentals and shorts getting fucked.

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvscvi/clf_crushing_shorts_with_steel_beams

The post above highlights some of the points on why the stock is an amazing play.

The link below shows the latest short interest report with 21% SI

https://fintel.io/ss/us/clf

""The 6 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for Cleveland-Cliffs Inc have a median target of 24.50, with a high estimate of 33.00 and a low estimate of 20.00. The median estimate represents a +20.93% increase from the last price of 20.26.""

This is already a no-brain play. The price of the stock has been suppressed for weeks by shorts and it is a ticking time bomb. B

https://youtu.be/kcagi2icXaU

Even the CEO has said these analysts should kill themselves.

The price of steel is at an all time high which means that the profit margins of companies lik CLF, who are vertically integrated with mining, processing, and producing are higher than ever. 

Let's take a look at the options chains

EXPIRING THIS WEEK:

8,000 OPEN INTEREST ITM CALLS EXPIRING
24,000 OPEN INTERESTED OTM CALLS EXPIRING WITHIN 10% price difference.

EXPIRING NEXT WEEK:

30K ITM
30K OTM WITHIN 10%

With a 10.123B market cap @ 20.27 a share we are looking at 500M shares.

WITH THE CALLS EXPIRING WE ARE LOOKING AT 6,000,000 SHARES ALONE WHICH EQUALS MORE THAN 10% OF THE FLOAT.

With a realistic price target set 20% higher than current price, and a massive surge in options being exercised within 10%, I'm expecting a share price of AT LEAST $30 short term. I'm surprised this stock hasn't had more publicity in forums personally so I thought I'd add onto the post I saw earlier.

&#x200B;

Option volume is a fraction of yesterday's for $WISH and $CLOV at this time. Lot's of ITM option volume (could be sales) and smaller volume OTM

&#x200B;

Might start taking profits now and see how the day goes

&#x200B;

$WISH:

Big price ramps from $10; $12.5; and $15 - doesn't look like it's  only retail buying  after-hours and pre-market. How many of the people here actually have permission to buy during pre-market or post-market hours?

&#x200B;

Next ramp is at $17.50 but the real money gonna be in the $20s. So much call contracts traded yesterday at the $20 strike

How high can $WISH go?

Pre-market is at $15 with a volume gap and no resistance until $20. From $20 upwards, the path is rockier BUT... We did see a lot of call volume at $20 and even more at $25. So if price reaches and is able to break that higher resistance up to $25, then it's fly high land

&#x200B;

$CLOV:

Same buying pattern, steady increasing. Now in $CLOV we didn't have higher option strikes than $22. They are available today tho. So keep checking the volume on the new strikes to estimate where this is going. Yesterday's option volume was   I N S A N E

Now They're Doing a NASDAQ IPO with Fenwick &amp; West who Just Completed The COIN IPO!!!,"Obviously CLOV has gotten all the attention as of recent. CLOV was up 85% today and had volume over 732M. The reddit army has taken charge and sent CLOV to truly to the moon. 

I want to share what I think is lining up to be the next CLOV... 

Still largely under the radar is Vancouver based WELL Health Technologies (TSX:WELL) which also has significant short interest, strong fundamentals , and billionaire backers. They just completed a $206M acquisition of “MyHealth” now making it the largest private clinic operator in Canada.

Just prior to that, the company recently announced the $372.9M Acquisition of CRH medical which significantly increased WELLs footprint in the US... This is where it gets interesting. Not only did JP Morgan extend there existing credit line to CRH medical by USD$100M to $300M and RBC provide a C$200M secured credit facility for the recent “MyHealth” acquisition. 

But the company legit partnered with Fenwick & West to assist with a NASDAQ IPO in Q4 of this year.... Fenwick client base is Facebook, Amazon, Cisco, and recently COIN... We are on a launch pad waiting to take off. 

Jumping into the charts now... WELL has consolidated for a year while they have exponentially grown the fundamentals of the business. Just recently they blew through every moving average.

RSI is still below 60% and heading in the right direction - Stochastics finally hit that oversold zone and have started to aggressively turn bullish. 

&#x200B;

Today we saw the stock find new support on the 50day SMA for a strong close.

I think it's very likely we see this breakout of its consolidation period tomorrow and find new support above 8.50 which would set it up for a potential Squeeze/Run into new ATH.

The sky is really the limit here as the company approaches $500M in revenue with Positive EBITDA and a NASDAQ IPO on the horizon. I think it has the potential to be 1 of 2 things.

On May 11, UWM said it would repurchase up to $300 million of its shares over the next 24 months. This is a sort of dividend to shareholders.

With its $12.8 billion market cap, the $300 million represents a 2.34% buyback yield to shareholders (i.e., $300 million/$12.8 billion) over two years. This is also worth 1.17% annually, or 13.6 cents per share.

Add that to the 5.25%dividend yield (i.e., 40 cents annually divided by $7.68). So the “total yield” as I call it, is worth about 6.42% (i.e., 53.6 cents divided by $7.68). At $10 per share, the total yield is 5.36 % annually more appropriate valuation.

As there are about 1.605 billion shares outstanding, the adjusted EPS will be $1.16 per share. At the recent price of $7.38, this puts UMVC stock on a forward P/E of just 6.4 times forward earnings. That is very cheap.

My estimate of $1.16 is close to analysts’ estimates, as seen by Seeking Alpha, of $1.14 per share. They also estimate $1.23 for next year. That puts UWMC stock on a forward P/E of just 6 times earnings.

I believe a more appropriate valuation is 8 times earnings. That puts the value at $9.84, or roughly $10 per share. This is a potential 36% gain for UWMC stock.",Discussion,0.86

* The market is sucking the dick of EV manufacturers, but EV production is low margin and low scale. **BlackBerry IVY is data monetization, which is high margin and has unlimited scale.** Within a few years, BlackBerry will be making much more than the auto manufacturers they're partnered with.
* Blackberry QNX is used by 23 of the world's top 25 electric vehicle OEMs.
* BlackBerry targets more than just EVs though. They also have or are developing products for healthcare, financial services, government markets, energy, gas, oil, and smart grid connected transportation.

# Cybersecurity Leader

* BB offers best-in-class security, safety, and reliability. 18 of the G20 governments are customers, and they are the only software company to attain various security certifications from the US Govt.
* Ransomware attacks have begun to impact American businesses like never before. Today, the commerce secretary stated ransomware attacks are here to stay, and that businesses should plan accordingly.
* You know that oil pipeline that was taken out by DarkSide ransomware and caused oil shortages across the southeast U.S? That wouldn't have happened if Colonial Pipeline were using BlackBerry. Something tells me companies won't be making that mistake in the future.
* According to Frost & Sullivan Research, BlackBerry addresses 96% of cyber threats, and 77% of Fortune 100 financial companies use BlackBerry software.

# Some Basics and Fundamentals

* BlackBerry has an \~$8bn market cap with $1bn+ in yearly revenue and $800m in cash.
* Since 2016, the number of QNX products has grown from 50 million to 175 million.
* BB owns \~38,000 patents worth approximately $450 million.
* BB recently won a lawsuit against Facebook. I am unable to find the details, but most estimates are for between $1bn - $5bn total, paid over the course of a few years. BlackBerry's current market cap is only $8bn...
* Blackberry has a strong customer base of critical infrastructure already, and their pivot from hardware to software means continuous subscription revenue.
* **If BlackBerry had the same market cap as competitor Crowdstrike -** **who it outperforms** **- it would have a stock price of $83.** That's just taking into consideration one aspect of it's business model.
* [Vanguard has doubled their position since Dec 31/2020.](https://np.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lzw0pn/vanguard_is_bullish_on_bb/)

# TL;DR: 🚀🚀🚀 BB is going past the moon and into Alpha Centauri. This company is so much more than a meme stock or a short term squeeze - it's a life changing opportunity. When BlackBerry starts getting IVY revenue, $20 will look like a joke and you'll have to explain to your wife's boyfriend why you didn't get in under $14 when you had the chance.

# BIG EDIT:

**I was asked about the bear case for BB. It's important to understand the risks of investing, and I'm not so in love with this stock that I'm blind, so here's the bear case:**

* A lot of investors have been underwhelmed by revenue so far, and BlackBerry missed their expectations for Q4 2020. But it's worth noting the reason for buying BlackBerry right now is that when IVY revenue starts rolling in these concerns will wash away. It's a longer term play, similar to Palantir.
* The bull case assumes CEO John Chen's estimate of being able to get roughly $500m for their patents is correct. If they get less than expected for that side of their business, or keep the patents and aren't able to monetize them in a meaningful way, that would be less than ideal.
* The Facebook settlement could end up being more like 500m than the 2bn+ that's expected.
* They could be passed in the cybersecurity field before they are able to leverage their current best in class service. This one is really unlikely considering how many other companies have tried to make products equivalent to what BlackBerry has - and failed.
* EV companies could end up making their own OS and data services to resist IVY adoption. Several are trying (Tesla always comes in this conversation as an example), but from everything I've read none have managed to make as safe and comprehensive a system as BlackBerry.

So, *if* IVY doesn't get adopted, they're no longer the leading cybersecurity company, their lawsuit is for less money than expected, and their patents are actually worthless - then BlackBerry is only a little undervalued instead of incredibly undervalued.

**Here's the most meaningful bear case right now though, and how the bulls can beat it:**

There seems to be a lot of upward resistance. Establishments, institutions, etc. are all convinced BB is a failed phone company stock worth $10. When it rises, large financial players short (because they believe they can buy back for $10 or less), buy puts, or just scalp to try and capitalize on the volatility which in turn creates a lot of resistance and breaks momentum.

I don't think there's any conspiracy, I think the big players are just incompetent. These are pretty normal pullbacks and reactions to a stock that's gaining so quickly. The problem is that those big financial players I mentioned (as well as a lot of people on WSB) don't understand *why* this stock is so desirable. They just think it's a meme stock that's being pumped and don't understand the potential of: A) Becoming an essential step of EV manufacturing; B) Being best in class security during an age of ransomware attacks. So instead of getting in and riding the momentum, they create a self fulfilling prophecy of pullbacks.

**The bulls can win the same way we've won in GME and AMC - by buying and holding. Continued days of large volume will completely fuck the bears who started taking huge short positions last week, leading to even bigger price movement. Buying shares or LEAPS and being patient is the way to play it and win big.** The bears win when bulls waste all their capital buying FDs that have no chance of finishing ITM or when they see a dip and paper hand their shares. It's funny to watch people freak out at a $2 dip when they easily could have just hedged that with a deep OTM weekly covered call. **Buy** ➡️ **Hold** ➡️  **Yacht**

Regardless of the resistance that exists at the moment, there will come a day when big finance starts racing to get in on BB - and they'll pretend they were right all along. We've seen it constantly in tech stocks over the past few years. WSB can just expedite the inevitable by getting in on BB while it's still incredibly cheap.",DD,0.88

"" The shorts doubled up in May, from 11 million shares in April to 18.5 million shares in May. Up over 50% from April short numbers. They are trying everything they can, but you can’t fight buybacks, dividend on 6/9, inclusion in MSCI and Russell, and technicals switching to bullish. They are paying insane 70%+ interest on borrowed shares too. It’s a perfect storm. Got my popcorn ready. ""

Price action has been very nice the last few days with shorts climbing as price does steadily aswell. Approximately 20%+ of the float is being shorted according to TD. Also with this run up you bet your ass they are all in the red. Like I said in my last post, the company is currently buying back shares as of last week - so the float is likely smaller reported making the short % even higher.

With ex dividend coming up on 6/9 (match made in heaven) these shorts are sweating bricks because they know they need to cover or they will have to pay out that dividend for each share shorted on a losing position. As you are seeing towards the end of today they were trying to dump the price - likely done with even more shorts probably with the idea once they dump it enough they can cover this shit position and run. Chart below shows how its almost impossible for any short to be in the green.

DO NOT SELL HERE - the pump hasn't even started to begin Wall ST shits on the company because it was a SPAC so they shorted the fuck out of it and have been having a cash fiesta since the merger crashing the price down to laughable numbers.

Execute contracts if possible - I dont think there are enough shares out there to cover all these positions

TLDR: UWMC over shorted and they will have no choice to cover or pay out the dividend by 6/9 unless they can crash the price by shorting more.... Sounds familiar

Positions: shit load of shares, 8/20 $6 calls that will be executed before ex dividend. 8/20 $7 calls, the cheap play that i just loaded on are the 6/18 $9 calls. DO AS YOU WISH SHARES WILL WIN NO MATTER WHAT BUT PROVIDE LESS TENDIES",DD,0.88

In fact, meme stocks may be immune to this gayness because they have nothing to do with market fundamentals or real economic data, which is what I think is going to drive a selloff.

**When?**

Starting tomorrow and lasting as short as 2 weeks or as long as a few months, with a hot CPI number as the catalyst. For those of you who don’t know and are literally trading stocks without paying attention to anything going on in the economy, the CPI (Consumer Price Index) number is the main gauge of inflation.

**How big?**

10% or more, depending on the magnitude of the CPI beat.

**Why?**

A feedback loop driven by algorithms that trade based on bond market data.

**Why should I give a shit about the bond market?**

I don’t trade bonds, and think bonds are for fucking nerds and boomers, but if you’ve been in the market since the beginning of the year you know that the bonds, specifically 10 year treasuries, are arguably the most important market drivers in the world. The bond market is about twice as big as the stock market and the price action of bonds dictates the movement of the stock market to a large degree. A big swing in the bond market has the potential to completely fuck the dynamics of the stock market and the CPI. When bonds get bought, the 10 year yield goes down and when they get sold, the yield goes up. The 10 year yield also goes up in response to inflation and dictates the mortgage rate one can get at a given time, the interest rate at which businesses can borrow money, etc. It is therefore a very important indicator for earnings predictions and general economics. Algorithms (which account for about 80% of stock market volume( either directly look at the 10 year yield to make trades or derive earnings estimates and other money flow from the 10 year yield.

**What have 10 year treasuries been doing lately?**

At the beginning of the year there was a correction based on a rising 10 year yield that was particularly bad for growth and tech stocks that do well in a low interest rate environment. The 10 year yield has been very low over the past year because when the market crashed, the fed enacted historically dovish monetary policy to bolster stocks and the overall economy. One of the policies the fed enacted was purchasing of bonds by the US treasury in order to keep the 10 year yield stable.  In recent months there has been talk of a “taper tantrum”  wherein the fed begins to phase out those stabilizing purchases as the economy recovers. Powell has been adamant that he will keep treasury purchase in place for the time being and that he will give us plenty of warning before he begins to taper bond purchases.

Last week, the fed announced that it was going to stop buying corporate bonds and ETFs, which was another dovish policy similar to treasury purchases that they were doing in the corporate bond market. The fed wasn’t doing a huge amount of corporate bond buying so that wasn’t a huge deal for the economy or market, but caused some to get nervous that the fed may be getting ready to ease 10 year note purchases in the months ahead. However, this fear was short-lived because last week, employment data came in that showed lower-than-expected job growth.

Generally, job growth is a very important inflation indicator. So important that until a few months ago when the fed changed its mandate, it was the main factor determining whether the fed would raise or lower interest rates. A cool employment number caused the bond market (also largely algorithm-driven) to buy a lot of 10 year bonds because weaker job growth is supposed to mean weaker-than-expected inflation. Therefore, over the past week, the 10 year yield has made a big move (about 8%) down and caused the broader indexes to rally. The S&P, Dow Jones, Russell 2000, and Nasdaq are all at or near record highs based largely on the fact that bond yields have been going down and algorithms have been triggered to buy. Right now the 10 year is hovering around 1.5%, which is the lowest rate it has been since March. Since the initial rise at the beginning of the year, the 10 year has typically bounced off of the 1.5% level and has gotten as high as 1.77%. Despite the rise of the 10 year, it is still well below its pre-crash levels of 2% or more.

&#x200B;

**What is going to happen to the 10 year yield going forward and how is that going to trigger an algorithm-fueled, gay bear feedback loop?**

Above I talked about how the 10 year yield fell on the cool jobs number. The glitch in the market matrix started last week when the ADP private payroll number came out. The report said 978,000 new jobs were created in May, a high number that was relatively in-line with most estimates. However, the ADP report has, for some reason, not been accurate over the past year or so. When the real employment number published by the government came out the following day, showing a mere 559,000 jobs being created, a corrective rally in 10 year treasury notes started and has persisted into today, driving the 10 year yield to multi-month lows.

*To summarize what has happened so far: ADP gave an employment number that diverged from the government employment number, the government employment number missed estimates, bond traders and algorithms derived a low inflation number from those low employment numbers and overcompensated bond purchases, bond yield went down, stonks went up.*

This overcompensation could affect the bond and stock market tomorrow and in the weeks ahead. There are a few potential catalysts that could drive a big move in the 10 year and the downstream stock market over the next week. The first one is a 10 year note auction today at 1 pm. While I don’t expect the auction to cause a major change in treasuries, there is a possibility that some selling could occur this afternoon to cause fluctuation in the 10 year since the price is at a multi-month high. Tomorrow and next week are huge catalysts though, because the CPI number is being released. While bond traders and algorithms attempt to derive a rough inflation number from employment data, the CPI number is the “real number” that indicates the level of inflation the economy is experiencing and what price people are paying in the typical transaction. On Wednesday next week, the Fed meeting and Powell’s subsequent comments will dictate how the Fed will respond to the inflation number and whether it will raise interest rates (it won’t) or begin tapering bond purchases (it might).

*The bear thesis is contingent on tomorrow’s CPI number being a huge beat.* That was the case last month and a big reason for the May selloff. While the expected number was 0.4% MoM, the actual number was double that (0.9%). Given that 10 year bonds are very overbought with an 8% rally this week, a hot CPI number like the one we saw in May could raise the 10 year yield as much as 10 basis points. If it goes up 5 or more basis points, a correction is highly likely and will have a magnitude proportional to the strength of the 10 year yield move. This is not guaranteed. This month’s CPI number is projected to be 0.3%, but based on various factors like continued housing market strength, increased oil prices (especially over the past month and with a big miss on crude inventories data this morning), and general price increases (see Chipotle news), I tend to think 0.3% is a very low estimate. Moreover, employment data may have been a red herring for bond traders and algos because of the continued unemployment assistance being given by the government. While a weak jobs number would normally produce a similarly weak CPI number, unemployment assistance has the ability to elevate prices without job growth. That is the main issue with the data being used by algos right now. While the bond market won’t necessarily react violently to a hot CPI number, the recent rally has it primed for a selloff and resultant spike in yields.

**Other Red Flags**

A few other things happening in the global economy and in volatility are making me nervous.

*A big one is China.* Yesterday, China released its own CPI along with its PPI (producer price index, or cost to manufacture goods). The Chinese economy showed a divergence between CPI and PPI, which is irregular. While Chinese producers showed the biggest overhead cost increase in decades, they seem to have decided to eat the cost and elected not to pass the price increase on to consumers. This makes sense if you agree with Powell’s standpoint on inflation being “transitory” (temporary). Eating production cost increases isn’t a big deal if it’s only for a few months and while it might cause company profits to dip, it won’t have a far-reaching economic impact unless it is sustained and producers are forced to pass the price increase to consumers. While I agree that huge inflation reads like I expect tomorrow are transitory, I still think overall inflation has picked up in a relatively permanent way. The current labor shortage along with job creation via stimulus and potential infrastructure spending will force companies to offer new employees higher salaries and increase salaries permanently across the board.  Also, something tells me US companies are less likely to eat increased production costs than Chinese companies which rely on low costs to gain an advantage over foreign rivals. There is also the possibility of the government instructing its companies to hold off on price increases while the recovery is taking place.

*Also, volatility is at an inflection point*. I follow volatility pretty closely, understand it, and have [written about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmt5s0/fyi_for_people_new_to_the_vix_and_vix_etfs_before/) in the past if you want to understand it better.  Currently, the VIX (which measures options premiums of S&P 500 stocks) is near post-crash lows. It got as low as 16.57 yesterday, which is about 7% off the low (not a lot for the VIX), and has generally bounced off of that range during swings over the past year. Today it’s up to 17.21. For comparison, it got up to near 22.00 during the May correction and was in the high 30s during January when meme’s almost destroyed the stock market. While a VIX rally doesn’t necessarily mean there will be a correction, high option premiums imply that institutions are hedging big swings. VVIX, the derivative of the VIX which measures the rate at which options premiums are changing and generally goes up prior to big moves, is way up today (9%). VXN, the new volatility measurement of the Nasdaq, is also near post-crash lows. While volatility is still elevated compared to 2019, the next couple of weeks will determine whether volatility decreases to pre-crash levels (10.00-20.00) or continues to stay in the range it has been in (20.00 to 40.00). Continued volatility decrease would be a good sign for the market, but I’m not sure we’re ready yet given the uncertainty of the situation.

**Powell**

If there is a correction, the length of time it will last is based largely on the Powell testimony. A hot CPI number might cause bond markets to freak out, but the fed’s stance will largely dictate whether a spike in the 10 year is confirmed and continues into the 2% range or if it stays steady. The CPI number will play a little bit into the speed at which the fed tapers asset purchases but they already know what they’re going to say next week for the most part. Another part of my bearishness has to do with my opinion that Powell will announce tapering between now and the end of the year next week, which could cause a correction regardless of tomorrow’s inflation data.

&#x200B;

**Oh yeah, RSI**

Edit: I forgot to add in the part about the indexes being overbought. They aren't horribly overbought like at levels we saw in September, but they're at levels they've bounced off of a few times in the past. This means there is plenty to sell if there is a bearish catalyst. In recent months, SPY has been able to do okay maintaining rallies in overbought conditions, while QQQ has performed pretty poorly when RSI gets above 70. RSI spikes (in either direction) on the yearly chart have been decent forward indicators of corrections since 2020.

**How to play**

Don’t buy VXX, UVXY, or any other leveraged index fund or volatility tracker. Those suck, have low upside, and don’t necessarily go up and down the market (see link above for explanation of VIX futures funds). Just play puts in the indexes (or calls if you disagree with me). I tend to think that monthly QQQ and IWM options are good targets because they have more beta than SPY. But the Nasdaq has already had a big correction while SPY has been largely unaffected and is closer to (may close today at) record highs.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TLDR: Bond market could shit its pants and cause a correction if the market underestimated the inflation data coming out tomorrow. Happy Pride Month.

Edit: Thank you for the pee martini, kind stranger!

Edit (6/10): CPI was higher than expected but not as bad as I thought it would be. Market correction may be delayed until Powell testimony but could still start today or tomorrow. If futures go down >1% that's a bad sign for indexes. Look for a 7+ basis point daily gain on the 10 year yield. Look for a fast dip in RSI. All of these are indicators that it's imminent. 

Powell will likely have to announce the taper next week and it will likely be gradually until the end of the year. Markets will probably bounce next month when the CPI report reveals that inflation is normalizing. However, oil prices have been spiking in June so if they continue to rise then CPI might not give a normalish print until August. If indexes see a >10% correction, give up YTD gains, and panic ensues, it will be the best buying opportunity of the year. Good luck retards.

Edit (6/10): I remain bearish and extremely gay. A 1.1% gain on the Nasdaq and huge bond rally after a second consecutive CPI beat reaffirm my belief that this is algo-driven and outrageous.

Edit (6/16): WEDNESDAY WEDNESDAY WEDNESDAY! FOMC CAGEMATCH. 

If Powell is too dovish then bonds could sell off and lead to a correction. Is he's too hawkish then bonds could sell off and lead to a correction. If he perfectly walks the tightrope then we could go higher still. Then again, bonds could also sell off and lead to a correction.

Edit (6/16): I was right and the worst thing that could have come out of the Fed meeting did, in fact, happen. The Fed did not announce a taper and increased inflation expectations. The 10 year bond yield is currently spiking upward and will likely exceed previous yearly highs in the next few weeks. Algorithm-driven selloff is commencing on bonds and the major indexes. Until the treasury selloff slows down this will not likely stop. Also, remember that quadruple witch will occur on Friday so volume will be extremely high.",DD,0.87

However this is straight from the horses mouth from a Ford Dealership in Canada. They clearly state and clarify this partnership directly on their dealership website. Information I have just come across today.

[https://www.rivercityford.ca/xl-hybrids/](https://www.rivercityford.ca/xl-hybrids/)

What's more is in their latest today that have opened a new Centre in MI today again stating that it's where Ford and GM cars will become electrified.

[https://twitter.com/xlfleet/status/1402634437083471883?s=21](https://twitter.com/xlfleet/status/1402634437083471883?s=21)

I've been watching the level 2 for days and every time volume dries up it's being accumulating. In my opinion they are simply messing with the price.

If you want to read their investors presentation see below.

[https://xlfleet.com/assets/Uploads/PDF/Updated-Investor-Presentation-9.21.20.pdf](https://xlfleet.com/assets/Uploads/PDF/Updated-Investor-Presentation-9.21.20.pdf)

What a lot of people are missing about $XL is they have fingers in every sector of the EV market. 

They have substantial cash reserves of $400,000,000 roughly 1/3 of their market cap so there is no immediate requirement for cash.

**Please read full DD bullet points below:**

**Basic Stats:**

Market Cap: $1b

Public Float 94.4m

Shares Short: 22.11M

Share Float Short: 23.3%

32 days of consolidation at lows meaning an extremely strong base has been put in at this price. Everybody has been shorting during this period is now trapped.

Vanguard loaded up 6,000,000 extra shares with some other funds increasing their positions.

Possible entry into the Russel Index which would see far more cash flow into the name.

On the 26th March 2021 a total of 205,641 shares were awarded to employees at an estimated cost price of $6.81; With a one year lock up. Giving them a massive incentive to hit targets.

XL recently bought WEES in a 50/50 cash and stock deal which again in my opinion is a great buy. World Energy generated $18 million in total revenue and was free cash flow positive for full year 2020. Its acquisition, which closed Monday, is expected to expand XL Fleet’s electric vehicle charging infrastructure capabilities, the company said

XL recently inked a deal with UBS arena to provide charging stations, solar generation and energy storage. For a total of 1,000 charging stations which is one of the largest deployments in the United States.

The company they inked the deal with also owns another 30 properties. Meaning more contracts is a very likely outcome.

They also announced that to cover their current clients who consist of names like Fedex, Coca Cola, Pepsi etc they would need to install over 100,000 charging stations making them the biggest player in the industry.

100's of millions sitting in cash

Finally a Short Float of 23.3% approx 22,000,000 shares short. For a comparison this is more than $AMC and $BB.

The market cap and share float are so small that the room for an explosive move is enormous.

I'm personally looking for a minimum of Shitrons target at $60 a share and based on current future projections

This is of course not financial advice and I'm long, will be buying more dips.",DD,0.87

305,UWMC,nayxtm,2021-05-12 22:45:25,UWMC and What's Happening: An Explanation of Rule 10B,"Hello, so as you can imagine UWMC flew to the moon on a day where the market shit the bed. So, what happened? We're seeing the beginning of a huge squeeze in the very early stages. I'm just going to go through a factual explanation and some numbers.

On the earnings call yesterday, the CEO of UWMC (Matt Ishbia) stated that they would start the buyback starting tomorrow pending the rules.

What rules are there for stock buybacks? Well, the relevant one is Rule 10B, and they regulate stock buybacks. Why is this important?

Well, UWMC had an over 15% short interest, and that was recorded for April 30th. After RKT's earnings on the 5th, and LDI's on the 3rd of May, and looking at UWMC's share price tank after these two reported earnings... We can well imagine that the short interest increased since then.

Let's discuss what's going on then first shall we. Rule 10B is a safe harbor provision for stock manipulation in regards to buybacks, and if you follow them you're generally safe. One of these requirements is in regards to how many shares you're allowed to purchase on a given day. That number is 25% of the average daily volume. The average moving volume for UWMC right now is 5.64 Million, which means that UWMC could have bought up to 1.41 Million Shares worth of Stock.  Volume today was 8.91 Million. That means that there could have been up to an extra 3.27 Million Shares of additional volume? My guess is that it's a mix of hedge fund bulls who smell blood in the water, and momentum traders from WSB or more generally.

What does that all mean however? Well, usually there is volatility crush after Earnings, but UWMC remained highly volatile after earnings with a IV above 100%. That, combined with the massive amount of buys today means that the interest rates to borrow shares have mooned from 3-5% to 34.9% per annum. That's a huge increase. However, the shares available to short according to IBorrowdesk has actually gone down significantly. What that means is that the shorters are still in the game, so to speak.

Some of you are wondering what happened from 3:45PM onwards, and there's actually an explanation for that too, and it's rooted in Rule 10B.   Under Rule 10B companies with higher average trading volume or public float value can trade until the last 10 minutes. The shorters in the stock thus felt safe enough to borrow more shares to try to bring down the shares. If you see on IBorrowdesk the available shares went down from 2,000 to 800, before bouncing back to 3,000. So someone drove the stock down, then covered slightly or his position completely.

So, what's going to happen now? The short percentage is still sky high, and they haven't budged. Well, here's the thing. The public float is 110 Million, but of that there is a decent percentage that are institutional buyers. UWMC can buy up to 1.41 Million of that a day (which costs them only 9 million dollars a day!), and as the daily moving average moves up, they can start buying more and more. Those shares are retired, and thus cannot be bought back by shorters to cover. Furthermore, there are institutional buyers, and sophisticated traders who will want to get into the action (conceivably) because they see the way this is going. Finally, the ex dividend date is June 10th and if they refuse to cover their liable to have to pay the dividend to the owners of the shares. Finally, interest rate will continue to skyrocket upward pressuring them to cover or else get liquidated. At 2% a year, shorting UWMC even with its dividend was feasible, but to short UWMC with a 100+ interest rate is going to just destroy them. Especially when they additionally have to cover the shares they sold short.

In conclusion, the match has been lit (in my opinion), and the fuse will blow sooner or later. One one hand, UWMC retiring shares, and on the other hand, buyers driving up the price and then holding.

Edit: This also means that UWMC can squeeze the shorters with a buy back, while maintaining inclusion in the Russel by the way!",Discussion,0.83

309,CLOV,nvi64u,2021-06-09 01:51:30,Our Four Leaf $CLOV 🍀,"Dear Apes, I'm writing to you today to tell you a few things. I see many people not understanding and wanting to. A lot of people spreading misinformation, etc. I want to clear the air and inform you, crayon eaters.

Welcome to WSB (Wall Street Bets) Reddit, the home of the Apes 🦍. We collectively are considered one of the largest hedge funds in the world. There are many baby crayon-eating apes who are eager to eat some tasty bananas 🍌. Many of you question how any of us make money, so please feel free to ask questions 💬 in the comments as I will be answering as many as possible, although keep in mind I am not a financial advisor, I simply love the stonks.

**The main topic and example today is $CLOV.** You've most likely been hearing a lot about it. Let me explain the hype behind our four-leaf clover and what you need to expect and do to make some crispy chicken tenders (currency).

$CLOV is a very shorted stock currently with an approximate short float of 50% (please correct me if I'm wrong). A short in simple terms is when someone bets on the stonk going down in value. They 'borrow' the stonk at $50, and give it back to the lender at the lower price of $20. Profiting $30. But here's the catch. If they 'borrow' the stonk at $50 and it going up to $100, they must buy the stonk at $100. Which will raise the price of the stonk. Make sense?

**Good. Now, what causes the short squeeze?** Truth is many factors. WSB as a whole usually rally around certain (meme) stonks that are either undervalued and/or highly shorted. Once we do it causes a jump in price. The shorts wet themselves from a gamma squeeze (high volume trading from Apes dumping all tendies into a stonk). This causes them to eventually have to pay back their shorts at a ridiculous price and in turn, causes the stock to go up.

**What is the perfect recipe?** Well, because it's so highly shorted and we have a ton of Apes hoping on the stonk going to the moon, they've bet on it. Opening many contracts on the four-leaf clover. Once the price reaches above a certain value, many will 'exercise' their contracts (which means actually purchase their shares at the 'strike' price they set it to. Causing a huge influx of shares to be taken at once.)

**Is it too late to purchase $CLOV?** No, it's not. Is it going to go up? It depends on us. If you hold, the shorts will need to pay those bananas back to us at a higher price. Did you get it too late? If you purchased below $25 so far, you will profit if you hold. $CLOV isn't as much of a meme stonk as you think. They have great fundamentals and actually are a great business. So everyone that has purchased, don't worry. You'll profit if you hold. What you're seeing now is only a gamma squeeze caused by us, and everything is going to plan.

**What will the price hit? When do I sell?** Good question, no one ever knows. But I can tell you personally, this will hit $50 no problem. The stonk market is a scary place. There is always a risk, but this risk, for now, is limited.

**Did I miss out? Should I buy it now?** It's up to you, I'm not s financial advisor. Personally, I'm doubling down tomorrow at open, no matter the price. So do what you must with that information.

To all of those stuck on AMC and GME. This is not for you. This is also not a distraction from either of those. Feel free to go with your gut. What I'm telling you, is there is tons of opportunity here, and there will be enough tendies for everyone.

Apes, stay calm, follow the drill. I wish every single one of you, the best of luck. 🍀 After all, we have the $CLOVer on our side. 👍

AMA 🗣️

Edit: On June 18th many options contracts expire. So expect tons of movement in the coming days in an upward trend. Expect price drops a day or two before June 18th as paper hands try and exit. Don't fret, it will go back up. 🎢 Also, NO SHORTS HAVE COVERED THEIR POSITIONS YET. This means this hasn't even begun yet. The next few days will be interesting.

Edit June 9th, 2021: Some may be very worried about the price dropping a tiny bit. This is something that happens with stocks. I call these types of fluctuations routine. I personally will continue to hold as it's clear that these fluctuations are perfectly natural and healthy. For me, there is absolutely no reason to sell or even worry. Good luck out there to all!",Discussion,0.69

Lets Send it to the MOON,"With all the hype this week doubt this gets read but wanted to post my first DD and hopefully share the love with my fellow smooth brain friends. This will probably be way too long for many, but hoping some will read it...

I love Energy Transfer ($ET) and think you could make at least *30%* this year... not to mention the options with extraordinarily low IV. I picked up 75 LEAPS a few months back and they have made a killing.

You've probably never heard of it but ET is one of the largest energy infrastructure companies in the U.S., consisting of 90,000 miles of pipelines, large amounts of storage capacity, 62 natural gas processing and treating facilities, 35 active refined products marketing terminals, and immense exporting capabilities. Its a MASSIVE company that has $40 Billion in revenue and a market cap of 27.4B... yes, you read that correctly.

Plus as a a partnership they give a ***7% distribution*** per year. They will pay you to hold the stock while it prints money and adds value (I have shares too). And you're not too late! The stock jumped from $10.15 last week to $10.75 today and the options prices have barely budged... just picked up 100 call contracts for October in anticipation of earnings. You can literally still pick up an $11 Call for10/15 for less than a dollar ($0.92) and if you're like me trading GME, BB, and even NOK that is mind blowing.

317,CLOV,nw6lmm,2021-06-09 23:16:51,A quick DD on CLOV borrowing fee,"Since I saw a lot of misinformed comments in the daily threads, I figured I would share this information.

The current borrow fee rate for CLOV is 116.7% (https://iborrowdesk.com/report/clov). The borrow fee rate is not the short interest; that is the number of shares shorted. 

The borrow fee rate is the amount it costs per year to short a share, as shorting requires borrowing. To put it into perspective, for a costant price, a yearly borrow fee rate of 116.7% would imply a daily cost of paying 0.3197% of the value of the shorted share.

0.32% in the world of returns is a lot. 

Yesterday, the short interest rate on CLOV was 43.54% (https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1402368431291314177?s=20). This number might be lower now, as the borrowing fee rate depends on other factors (volatility, ease of locating shares) than just the supply available; shorts may have covered a bit. It will, however, not be a lot lower. What this implies is that for some 30%-50% of the number of shares available on CLOV, the shorts are paying 0.32% of the price of the share just for holding the position, every. single. day. 

The shorts are absolutely bleeding buckets. In fact, this situation, including the drop today, is incredibly similar to GME; I dare say even more so than AMC. Another great buy, support each other please.

I currently hold multiple call options comprising 19% of my portfolio, and that's only because GME takes up 60%.

Obligatory rocket emojis 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Edit: Since I made this thread I received a lot of good, confirming information, which I would like to summarize here:

- The short interest rate is currently at 50.42% according to Ortex.

- https://fintel.io/shortSqueeze model states CLOV is currently most likely to squeeze.

- questrade Canada also has a borrow fee of 59%.

- Additionally https://www.shortsight.com/ shows that CLOV has a bullish sentiment with a low share availability score of 4, meaning shares are confirmed really limited across the board. This means multiple brokerages are confirmed to have a hard time locating shares. That is huge. Remember what caused GME to not be allowed to be bought anymore? Borrowing fee rates were high for a ton of brokers, and some, including IBKR and Robinhood, had these high borrowing rates in place because they were running out of shares to locate. They could no longer provide the shares they are obligated to provide to those who either want to short or buy the share. And hence they shut both down, as otherwise the brokerages themselves would trigger an insane and instant shortsqueeze. An incredible indicator.

Because $ASTS or AST SpaceMobile Inc. has patented disruptive technology that will turn every cell phone into a satellite phone. What does that mean? It means no more dead spots, spotty connection, and loss of service and more.

This isn’t the reason the price is being driven up although. The reason why is Because on Monday, rumors began floating that AST might soon be added to the Russell 2000 index of small companies. That would require mutual funds and ETFs that track the index to buy AST shares, presumably pushing up the price. Along with heavy short volume this can have similar squeeze to $CLOV and more with a long term growth potential future.

Now They're Doing a NASDAQ IPO with Fenwick &amp; West who Just Completed The COIN IPO!!!,"Obviously CLOV has gotten all the attention as of recent. CLOV was up 85% today and had volume over 732M. The reddit army has taken charge and sent CLOV to truly to the moon. 

I want to share what I think is lining up to be the next CLOV... 

Still largely under the radar is Vancouver based WELL Health Technologies (TSX:WELL) which also has significant short interest, strong fundamentals , and billionaire backers. They just completed a $206M acquisition of “MyHealth” now making it the largest private clinic operator in Canada.

Just prior to that, the company recently announced the $372.9M Acquisition of CRH medical which significantly increased WELLs footprint in the US... This is where it gets interesting. Not only did JP Morgan extend there existing credit line to CRH medical by USD$100M to $300M and RBC provide a C$200M secured credit facility for the recent “MyHealth” acquisition. 

But the company legit partnered with Fenwick & West to assist with a NASDAQ IPO in Q4 of this year.... Fenwick client base is Facebook, Amazon, Cisco, and recently COIN... We are on a launch pad waiting to take off. 

Jumping into the charts now... WELL has consolidated for a year while they have exponentially grown the fundamentals of the business. Just recently they blew through every moving average.

While I'm still not 100% certain on the longevity of the company yet until I see more progress, short term I think this thing has plenty of room to run in the current market. Also, this bad boy has seen numbers like $40+ and I'm confident if momentum picks back up this thing can get back up to the $20+ range.

There is information going around the $WKHS owns 10% of $RIDE and that $WKHS should go down with it as well. Initially, I thought the same thing until I did a little more research and found out that $WKHS owns part of $RIDE through a licensing deal where $RIDE paid $WKHS $12 million dollars in exchange for intellectual property and 10% stake in their company. This isn't something that $WKHS paid cash for, its basically free stake in that company.

The FED only has two options at the moment:

Raise rates to curb current inflation. This would cause the treasury to raise its coupon rates (bond interest), which would mean lower bond prices. This means the government has to pay higher interest, ultimately leaving the treasury no other option than defaulting on its obligations.

2. The FED doesnt raise rates, and lets inflation (and later hyperinflation) eat away at the dollar. This would also make the bonds worth less, as theyd have to lower the price to compensate for the interest being worth nothing. In this situation, the fed would be the only one willing to hold government bonds which would worsen the inflation as they effectively dont get payed interest on it.

Option one, the government goes bankrupt due to interests being to high to pay back. Option two, the public goes bankrupt due to hyperinflation.

Either way, a short position would profit in this trade.

^(Disclaimer: This is not financial advice, this is my opinion, do your own DD. Unlike my last post, this one will not mention ass to mouth, sorry. It took me three hours to write this because my mom would only release one of my arms from my chair restraints for fear of me buying more CLOV puts. As far as ASO goes..... I like the stock.)

Hello again WSB apes, cows, and palan-tards,

A lot of you have probably never heard of ASO (Academy Sports) because we all know you never leave the carboard castle your mom helped you build in the basement where you ""day trade"" (read: buy high sell low duh idiot). 

Academy Sports deals in all things outdoors. Guns, ammo, team sports stuff (no, larping in the park downtown doesn't count), apparel, shoes, etc... Notice I didn't say anything about video games, free popcorn, or leprechauns. We're talking about a whole different animal here. Academy is located mainly in the Southern United States and operates 250+ stores. In the year 2000 (ancient history for some of you autistic fucks) they had 35 stores. 

# ASO went public via IPO in October of 2020 at a price of $12 or some shit. Let's take a look at what it's done since then, starting with the first 6 months of it's life:

**WARNING: This next section contains some really retarded Travelcenters of America type of shit. Look at these extremely simplified charts may cause wrinkles, but is more likely to further smooth your brain; you're welcome.**

https://preview.redd.it/4iic0sbxi2471.png?width=1945&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f0f7188de3b4d176262467f811ecba409ae3c68

As you can see (or maybe you can't because it's so fucking small) ASO doubled  🚀 in its first 6 months on the market. For you really smooth brains, that's about $12 or 100% of upward movement. Now let's take a look at the 2 months since then...

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dcadus2fj2471.png?width=2007&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb5ec12a9880920a4fafda29f931e3e1fd7b792a

Notice the slope of the line changed drastically. The earnings call in late March/early April was the kick in the ASO this thing needed. People started to realize this thing was undervalued and making fuck tons of money. 

# Today, ASO had their next earnings call. How'd it go?

First of all, I fucking hate premarket earnings calls. It's already hard enough to get out of bed with the thought of living in a world where people actually invest in PLTR. Moving on to the earnings; in short, they fucking killed it again and bigger than last time:

* Adjusted income of $182.5 million vs Q1 2020 $400,000 income **(profitability)**
* EPS of $1.89 (estimate was $0.90, 100%+ beat) vs Q1 2020 $0.01 **(shareholder value)**
* Revenues up 40% year over year to $1.6 billion vs already optimistic estimate of $1.5 billion **(sales)**
* Upped their 2021 guidance to $4.50 EPS (I think it was $3.90 or $4 or something who cares)

ASO is currently trading at a P/E ratio of about 9. The US industry average for specialty retail is about 15, representing a 50%+ upside based on P/E alone and not considering the fact that it's growing like your weird aunt's face boil (that thing's a tumor and you can't convince me otherwise)

# ""I see the lines and all the dildos, but what do I do?"" A fair question, fellow retard. I have no fucking clue...

Somehow today, and as has been tradition for the last 6 weeks or so, the stock price dropped some after killer earnings, allowing for a beautiful entry point. 

I like the stock. I like the trend. I like the business. You can deduce my July 16th positions by looking at the second screenshot if you're less than 96.7% retarded. This thing barely ever touches that the blue line on those charts because it's still undervalued. I thought the trend would slow and the growth would slow, but it hasn't yet and it only keeps getting better and better data to support the pattern.

This isn't a squeeze. No gamma, short, titty, or otherwise. This is a less direct path to the moon and mars than rolling the dice with your net worth on retarded FD moves. This is a solid play for your portfolios to hedge against your absolutely mind blowing decision making process, or lack thereof. 

See you on the moon.

Actually, AMC was my inspiration for looking deeper into the GME chart - it had/has a **fantastic setup**.

[AMC TA](https://preview.redd.it/gju8synduwz61.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=46c863adbb144c04e3327bb212a79bb1633608fc)

Broke a massive falling wedge on the daily chart with a great increase in volume. It's also a cup and handle dating back to January. There was even confluence with key resistance near the breakout point @ **11.58.**

**13.24** is key support now, keep an eye on that.

We have been coiling under key resistance for a few days (**14.53) THE SECOND THIS BREAKS, WE ARE CLEAR FOR TAKEOFF (AGAIN).** Also - note the way we are coiling upwards below key resistance is a very bullish data point. Volume is declining as we chop up.

Price targets are **17.25 & 20.36.**

This is the best setup I've seen in this stock since the initial squeeze. Remember, keep it simple.

***TL;DR -*** AMC actually looks good for once from an **unbiased** technical standpoint

Not Financial Advice

Edit: Only thing I forgot to mention was the upper trendline of the wedge extends back to that 17.25 high - this is just another data point that adds to the validity of the breakout.

Many are missing the point.

Even if an instrument is going to the moon, it doesn't mean the current entry is a low risk, high reward proposition...

Bear with me guys, here is the  famaous digital Dog   chart to exemplify this point. Fear of missing out is NEVER a good idea. Look how far you are from the moving average... I feel vertigo just looking at it.

https://preview.redd.it/x67cnp5evgy61.png?width=1665&format=png&auto=webp&s=335c9d39eff4e40743e8d537787822b7f4e1f433

You might feel like a star buying here, as the price might go parabolic some more... but what you didn't know is you're walking a high strung tight rope. The slightest wind and you come tumbling down 1000 metres.

Unless you are a good sentiment reader, it's hard without a chart to really see how dangerous the situation is.

Now to some  silver charts! Check out the setup for silver  .

 Here we go!

**Evidence #1 - US Dollar and inflation adjusted**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bhi4hxovwgy61.png?width=1825&format=png&auto=webp&s=41b14643cd570a05387b455f08e154b9d8c7739f

 Inflation adjusted shows the truth to how your purchasing power has been subdued, even if the US Dollar index had strong bear market rallies since 1980.

Half-life of 15 years (US Dollar loses 50% of it's value every 15 years).

New bearish cycle is about to start.

Silver & friends will have a strong tailwind.

 **Evidence #2 - Gold vs Dow Ratio** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rh5mmal3xgy61.png?width=1828&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc91b3183804c58e77330288e998a25010bf83ca

 Point and figure charts remove time scale meaning, and add new columns only when price action reverses sufficiently (else it just fluctuates in same column).

When US equities go in BUBBLE MODE, gold (and silver) get relatively cheaper, creating a low risk, high reward entry points.

We are at similar points prior to a 1929 crash or 1972 inflation cycle.

Buying silver or gold now is not buying EXPENSIVE, but historically CHEAP.

**Evidence #3 - Silver vs Dow's 3 ""inflation adjusted"" cycles**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9gtc4d2gxgy61.png?width=1838&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bf7822f7a5da4856e13fc475914b0d8da4108b2

 Arcs are a powerful tool to identify a downtrend, the slowing of that downtrend, and the eventual rise from the ashes.

When you get 2 bounces off the right hemisphere, the new uptrend is confirmed and probabilities of a sustained uptrend is increased.

Angle of descent is usually angle of exit.

This JUST happened now.

**Evidence #4 - Silver's 50 years bi-monthly log chart** 

Once the price is out of the red cloud, it is GO TIME! You may start to fly 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sdr2m405zgy61.png?width=1828&format=png&auto=webp&s=db5c954c04d705e9dfebe81bb33d5a576dbd9fce

**Evidence #5  Lastly - Silver's Relative Strength to SPX ( US equities)**

Another view for silver, now comparing it's performance vs SPX (US equities). When the capital flows leave US equities and start flowing in silver... it creates an explosive move. Don't believe me? check out the chart right below. 

https://preview.redd.it/tet12j4bzgy61.png?width=1828&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb61d89486d5ec0cf4a33c8ab7bed7986fba54ad

Notice the differences? Fear, and more fear. Close to the moving average, the risks are low, especially in a precious metals bull market. Nobody on mainstream media talking about silver really nowadays .

 **Conclusive Thoughts...**

THE INVESTMENT OF THE DECADE

 I’ll just put this out there - silver is ABOUT TO GO TO THE MOON. This is the buying opportunity of a lifetime. A group of people around the whole world are buying up all the silver to drive up the prices. Everyone's doing it, and you should do it too. 

I would like to thank fellow Patrick Karim  for those fantastic charts . Or to follow him on twitter   [https://twitter.com/badcharts1](https://twitter.com/badcharts1)

It's the most shorted stock which many are aware but is there a fundamental reason to buy other than a squeeze? I'm no expert on EV battery companies. Let me say that again, I am no expert. But they've  had my interest for awhile now. 

What are your thoughts? Any competitors you are bullish on that you like better? And why? Additionally, anyone familiar with future contracts Workhorse might be vying for? I know they lost out on  the USPS contract but anyone here heard through the grapevine of some big ones in the near future? Again, EV battery companies are not my forte. Would love to hear your input.

On May 11, UWM said it would repurchase up to $300 million of its shares over the next 24 months. This is a sort of dividend to shareholders.

With its $12.8 billion market cap, the $300 million represents a 2.34% buyback yield to shareholders (i.e., $300 million/$12.8 billion) over two years. This is also worth 1.17% annually, or 13.6 cents per share.

Add that to the 5.25%dividend yield (i.e., 40 cents annually divided by $7.68). So the “total yield” as I call it, is worth about 6.42% (i.e., 53.6 cents divided by $7.68). At $10 per share, the total yield is 5.36 % annually more appropriate valuation.

As there are about 1.605 billion shares outstanding, the adjusted EPS will be $1.16 per share. At the recent price of $7.38, this puts UMVC stock on a forward P/E of just 6.4 times forward earnings. That is very cheap.

My estimate of $1.16 is close to analysts’ estimates, as seen by Seeking Alpha, of $1.14 per share. They also estimate $1.23 for next year. That puts UWMC stock on a forward P/E of just 6 times earnings.

I believe a more appropriate valuation is 8 times earnings. That puts the value at $9.84, or roughly $10 per share. This is a potential 36% gain for UWMC stock.",Discussion,0.86

There's plenty of tickers being thrown around on here for quick money, but $WISH is potentially the best candidate of them all. Let's take a look at the reasons why this bad boy will rip faces off and print paper for us all.

1. This stock is ACTUALLY heavily shorted. Users with YOLO positions already in place have made this clear. Currently around 11.5% of the float is sold short, and with a float of 272 million shares, that's pretty sizable.
2. Check out this beauty of a chart

367,SNDL,nt0w9y,2021-06-05 19:32:56,The Bullish Argument for SNDL - Sundial Growers 🌱☀️,"Sundial Growers (SNDL) looks like a compelling buy at these levels, here’s why:

 1. They rose capital in February at $1.50 which traditionally acts as a floor for the stock.

2. Trades at 2x tangible book value compared to 12x tangible book value at cgc and acb. 

3. Had a nice high volume spike in February. It’s very common for the big mountain rise to come roughly four months after the initial molehill rise on big volume. We’re roughly 4 months from when the initial run up happened implying the Daddy run up could be near. 

4. Daily short volume remains very elevated with average daily short volume consistently around 50% although we were about 40% on Friday (which is still quite high) https://www.shortvolume.com/?t=SNDL Short interest is 13.78% as of May 14th implying shorts are shorting (selling shares they don’t own) in the morning and rebuying in the afternoon in hopes of spooking others out of their shares. This implies the short interest is quite underreported. If longs can hold strong and bring higher price action towards the end of the day these shorts are going to be overwhelmed with the sp, not to mention potential margin calls as SNDL increase it’s volatility and holding requirements. 
Once we see potentially see the automatic covering is when the party really starts 🎉

5. We had nice big volume up days of 622 million in May 28 and 894 million in June 3rd compared to Friday’s down day with only 372 million shares traded. Another bullish sign that the big volume days were also very green days while the red day was on muted volume. 

6. Stick with equity if you can. I predict the big institutions who are buying into SNDL are selling a boatload of options and ensuring the price stays under their expiration so they can collect premiums while lowering their cost basis. It’s happened the last two weeks. This can’t go on forever as the stocks price should match it’s value which imo is in the $4+ range (about 8x tangible book value) sooner rather than later. 

7. SNDL has only announced positive news and quality acquisitions since its peak in February with preferred debt and 19% equity stake in Indiva which owns many brands including the #2 gummy producer in the U.S. WANA Gummies. Sundial also acquired a large stake in The Valens at a deep discount compared to today’s price. Furthermore, SNDL acquired all of Inner Spirit which has the most retail cannabis stores in Canada at 80 stores. Sundial will undoubtedly replace current inventory with their own solidifying their strength as the only true vertical cannabis operator from growing, processing and extracting, to store front selling. As the industry continues to mature the margin increase Sundial will see is out of this world. Not to mention the free publicity from Reddit and Robinhood. For SNDL to consistently be a top 5 stock on Robinhood with a market cap of $2 billion is unheard of. The excitement around the stock will continue to help its real world performance. 

8. Sundial could very likely be acquired at any moment with 0 debt, over $1 Billion in assets including $900 million in cash. SNDL is a massive acquisition candidate at a fundamental level as it only trades at 2x book value with positive operating profit last quarter compared to CGC and acb which trade at 11x book value. 

9. As mentioned, Sundial had positive operating profits for the first time this quarter (primarily through passive security appreciation which shows no sign of stoping). If SNDL can continue the trend it will be picked up by more and more non weed hedge funds that require multiple quarters of positive operating profit before they can be incorporated. 

10. When someone buys potx or other weed etfs they automatically purchase 4.35% sundial and 5.6% of the Valens as those are the current weightings in the fund. Not to mention Indiva at a lower %. For every dollar that flows into PotX more than 10% goes to SNDL related companies. Every dollar that flows into weed funds in the future will help sundial. Imagine the money that will flow into weed companies and these funds once federal legalization is passed. 

11. The share count of 1.86 Billion is no more than Palantir or NIO which sit at 1.88 and 1.7 Billion shares, respectively.

12. SNDL currently has 4.79% institutional ownership compared to over 15% at CGC and acb. As time goes on this will continue to rise. It’s pretty normal for a developed company to have over 60%+ if not 80% institutional ownership, especially at a book value like Sundials. Book values traditionally act as a permanent floor for the stock, especially with SNDL’s positive operating profit and expected earnings growth and sales growth of 50% in 2022. 

13. The meme stock craze is not close to over. It’s just now being reported again on tv. Excitement is brewing and as normals continue and hear about it and get in, the avalanche should build higher than February’s peak. Sundial differentiates itself from the other meme stocks with it’s strong balance sheet and excitement around the up and coming industry. To me, investing in Sundial here combines level head value investing with the excitement of a new industry and the loyal meme craze. 

14. The new Sundial management team has been in place just over a year (Jan 30th, 2020) and seem to have remedied many of the operational mistakes of their predecessors (which is a main reason the stock was down from ipo price) https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/sundial-announces-departure-of-ceo-and-other-leadership-changes-and-optimization-initiatives-870988349.html 

15. They have a diversified acquisition strategy with new acquisitions in Indiva, The Valens and Inner Spirit which will lead to full vertical integration after the deals close in late summer (growing, processing/extracting and retail distribution). Sundial’s other investment holdings include: 100% ownership of Sprout Technologies, KamCan Products, 2011296 Alberta Inc, Sundial Deutschland, GmbH, Sundial Portugal, 2657408 Ontario Inc, NGBGA-BC Holdings and 50% ownership of Pathway Rx. They still have $1 Billion CAD in cash if the right opportunity comes along.

Hope some people found this background on the company helpful. Sundial seems to have a great runway to take off (fundamentally and technically) not to mention future catalysts like potentially breaking into the drinks market, as well as having many more medicinal and mental health uses. It’s undeniable that weed is losing it’s negative stigma and is way more popular in entertainment and social settings than it has ever been. Only a matter of time before you can order it at a bar or sporting event. It’s the trend of the youth and it’s just getting started. I’m here to answer any questions. Not financial advice.",DD,0.83

**Background:**

Petco ($WOOF) is a brick and mortar store in the United States and Mexico, which provides pet food and pet related products, as well as serving as a veterinarian hospital and pet adoption centre in many locations. It also partners with companies like Canadian Tire to market its products in Canada. Kind of like Gamestop, this is an old-school brand in the suburbs, servicing a niche need - pets instead of video games. 

Petco was started in 1965, has nearly 1,500 locations and over 25,000 employees ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petco ). It began trading on the Nasdaq in January 2021, and had an opening price of ~$27. The current CEO, Ron Coughlin (formerly at HP and Pepsi), took over in 2018 and their performance has increased steadily since. 

On 19th May 2021, both Bank of America and Credit Suisse both set a price target of $28. On 2nd June 2021, Citigroup set a price target of $31. 

Petco is currently trading around $22, so it potentially has around 27% - 41.5% of upside before reaching fair value.  
Historically, $19 has been a support level for this stock. RSI(14) is currently at 39.27, so it's approaching oversold levels. 

However, as explained below, this stock may see a short squeeze before the end of June, so the short term upside could be much higher.

Information taken from their latest earnings report (https://ir.petco.com/news-releases/news-release-details/petco-health-wellness-company-inc-announces-record-results-first)

Fiscal Q1 2021 Highlights:
Comparisons are first quarter of 2021 ended May 1, 2021 versus first quarter of 2020 ended May 2, 2020 unless otherwise noted
	• Net revenue increased 27 percent to $1.4 billion driven by comp sales growth of 28 percent
	• Net income increased $38.7 million to $7.6 million or $0.03 per share, inclusive of $20.8 million of non-cash charges related to the refinancing of the company's term loan and revolving credit facility
	• Trailing twelve month net income of $12.2 million increased $101.8 million
	• Adjusted Net Income1 increased $60.0 million to $44.4 million or $0.17 per share
	• Adjusted EBITDA1 increased 45 percent to $125.7 million
	• Trailing Twelve Month Adjusted EBITDA increased 26% to $523.3 million
	• Net cash provided by operating activities increased $147.3 million to $115.0 million
	• Free Cash Flow1 increased $127.8 million to $67.7 million
	• Total debt decreased $1.8 billion or 52% to $1.7 billion driven by the proceeds generated in the company's initial public offering, related recapitalization, and Free Cash Flow1 generation
	• Net Debt1 decreased $1.7 billion or 53% to $1.5 billion
	• Net Debt1 / Trailing Twelve Month Adjusted EBITDA1 improved 62 percent to 2.9x
	• Liquidity of $594.5 million inclusive of $174.0 million of cash and cash equivalents and $420.5 million of availability on revolving credit facility.
	• Ended the quarter with 1,453 Pet Care Centers, 137 Full Service Vet Hospitals within Pet Care Centers, and 100 Pet Care Centers in Mexico 

2021 full year outlook:
Revenue: $5.475 - $5.575 Billion
Capital Expenditures: $235 million
Adjusted Earnings per Share: $0.73 - $0.76

**Potential June Short Squeeze:**

The price has been artificially deflated by short sellers and Petco is now the 17th most shorted stock on the market. It has more short interest than most meme stocks, and it would take shorts more than 7 trading days to cover, with average volume. 

The price target for fair value is at least $6 from the current price, so even without a squeeze there's some deep value here. Remember, DFV bought $12 calls and that small expected gain turned into a fortune. There seems to be a similar set-up here. 

But the story gets really interesting when you look at the options flow. There's a HUGE volume of $30 calls expiring 6/18, so someone has made a very large bet that the price will be at least $8 higher a week from now. If the price manages to break above $30 before next Friday, it will cause more forced buying and potentially trigger a ""mini-squeeze"". Someone has taken a dim view of pet supply companies, because another mini-squeeze happened last week with $PETS and no-one noticed. 


**Timing and playing this stock**

I'm playing it by getting calls in between the price and my $28 target, long dated. So far I have September, but I'll keep accumulating longer expiry calls. I'm expecting a sharp decline in the market on Thursday 10 June 2021, so I'll add more then, but I've already got some calls just in case the wider sell-off doesn't impact this stock. $19 was the last support zone, but it looks like $22 is supporting it now. Anything below $22 is an instant buy for me. 22-24 is an acceptable entry point.

**Edit**
I forgot to mention the stock offering on the 28th of May. It's also partly why the stock dropped at that time, as they set a sell price of $24, which beat down the price below 24, and which lead to more declines last week. But it looks like the new stock was absorbed by the market and $WOOF has found it's new support at 22.

**Edit #2** this was at $22.30 when I posted. Now $23.27.

**Edit #3 - 9 June** full disclosure, I took off about 75% of my risk with this one ahead of tomorrow's CPI print. Too much uncertainty. I've left 25% of my position in case it moons in response. Will check out tomorrow's price action and try to find a place to re-enter. Also, more WOOF shares will be released 13 July 2021, so my time horizon with this play just got shortened.",DD,0.91

380,WISH,nv8sfe,2021-06-08 18:56:44,WISH DD Part 2 (more pieces of puzzle),"# MODS ASKED ME TO MOVE Parts together, so Part 3 is copied again below.

&#x200B;

**P1:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nqkzbc/wish\_institutional\_share\_increase\_with\_open\_puts/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nqkzbc/wish_institutional_share_increase_with_open_puts/)

&#x200B;

Hey, adding a part 2 for Wish DD since more information came to light.

**Summary of p1**: Hedge funds bought shares at a high and a boat load of puts. Stock got shorted down from $15 to $7.60 and the puts printed. They then averaged out their high bought shares. Shares increased from less than 100k shares to over 1million shares (times 2) for two examples mentioned.

&#x200B;

**Why part 2? Information that came to light:**

So on Finviz the last short interest reported was at 8% of the float.

Recently Bloomies terminal updated and now the SI is at 48% of float.

https://preview.redd.it/vff1du0hm2471.jpg?width=1009&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f090821f5da533403f6410d8d7341cc0a8e96d27

Very critical in confirming the reasoning behind how the price got pushed down from $15 to $7.60 and a ton of puts were bought before the drive down.

&#x200B;

**Trading volume:**

The average trading volume for WISH is at about 5million, for the past two days we are seeing record highs of 50million in volume back to back. This is an indication that the floor has been met and there is absorption going on. The $7.90/$8 has rejected and Wish is now pointed upwards at the short sellers.

&#x200B;

**Price Targeting?:**

This is only a run up and since the shorts opened at $15 there is time for them to close with little to no losses espcially since the run up has been small. Given that the price dropped from $12 to $10 previously and the price today hit $9, the shorts who opened at $10 will start the covering. If the short squeeze from $10 rolls over, I do not believe $15 is the next level, it would be at $21. Reason being the past two absorption levels were at $20-$21.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4l6i24kyn2471.png?width=1367&format=png&auto=webp&s=85d303c32b3061b9673d4c3d87eae899aaf20188

Edit\* Added float information

**Float vs Shares Outstanding:**

So the shares outstanding for Wish is around 600m but the last time the public float was reported at 300m. Today in the Bloomies update the public float is at 60m. With the float size decreased by so much WISH is super volatile, the price action might even break my $21 thesis since many less shares are exchanged and a short covering would require half the float to be traded.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Edit\* the original tradeable float was 600mm-120mm lock up = 480mm

The current trading float is 60mm after the shrinkage.

&#x200B;

**Float Shrinkage:**

With a ton of institutional investors the float shrink probably means something was at work and the price was pushed down so shares can be bought up by someone else. Basically a buyback without shrinking the total number of shares in the market.

The plan to bring the price down to do the shady exchange have been caught with the pants down. Right now the pants are down and the exchange of shares is happening for control of the company. The shorts need to be covered and the float will need to hit shares outstanding again.

>! Possible price target $100. The normal float if 480mm shares exchanged in a day during a squeeze.!<

&#x200B;

**Verdict:** >!The rocket is in motion.  🚀 🚀🚀 and I like this stock!<

>!The Art of the Deal!<

&#x200B;

**p1:** Shares shorted, puts bought, shares held gone up to ATH by hedgefunds

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nqkzbc/wish\_institutional\_share\_increase\_with\_open\_puts/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nqkzbc/wish_institutional_share_increase_with_open_puts/)

**p2:** Bloomies updated, SI went from 8% to 48%, tradable float down from 300m to 60m

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nv8sfe/wish\_dd\_part\_2\_more\_pieces\_of\_puzzle/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nv8sfe/wish_dd_part_2_more_pieces_of_puzzle/)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Why is Part 3 coming in so fast? **The puzzle might be solved and the pants are down.**

&#x200B;

Strange how the tradable float can go from 300m to 60m and institutional investors at 98%.

>!This only means one thing, something shady is going on!<.

Piecing the pieces together, the float shrinkage is due to shorting and an artificial buyback without actually reducing shares. The thesis is that there is a takeover of WISH shares and the prices was driven down with puts and shorts so the shares can be exchanged at lower price. The results of the shorting and exchange created a low float and now as the exchange is happening.

Right now, the stonk dealers got caught with their pants down mid exchange and the shorts need to be covered and the transaction completed at a higher cost basis.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The covering:**

Edit\* With such a low float of 1/8\* the actual real float this WISH squeeze might be yuge.

Low float  ✔️

High volatility  ✔️

High Shorts  ✔️

Bottomed  ✔️

Pants still down?  ✔️

I like this stock ✔️

381,WISH,nqkzbc,2021-06-02 14:46:43,WISH Institutional Share Increase with Open Puts.,"I heard you like DD and bear hunting so here's the big reveal. &amp;gt;!Sometimes the bear is the bull.!&amp;lt;

**Source:** reading through 13F Filings of hedgies

**On this episode of Who Owns These Puts?**

Our robot Edgar or Marvin, whatever you want to call him... dropped us GOLD! Through some digging on all 13F filings recently, there is only 1 big owner for the over 9000 $WISH puts that expire very soon. From there we find the inner workings of a rocket in assembly that we must sit in on before they launch. Talk about free lunch.

**Current short float:** \&amp;gt;10%

**Who do you think it is?** Melvin? Citadel? Guess again, it's &amp;gt;!Sus-quana (SIG)!&amp;lt;

**Who else would hold this ""sus"" position?**

**Exhibit A:** Who owns $16m in puts?

https://preview.redd.it/iyv4zpcilu271.png?width=1304&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ce70b5867f585a9cff56d515ea87fcd78c90e769

&amp;amp;#x200B;

**Exhibit B:** 5/17 filing over 9000 OI, the only possible culprit for 6/18 expirations

https://preview.redd.it/ozzqetdjlu271.png?width=2175&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ee3375750adab580e2cc4d97c4b14e7cdc06584f

&amp;amp;#x200B;

**Exhibit C:** 3/26/2021 Sus owns 420,000 shares and around 2000 puts to hedge possibly (Not sure who bought those shares but he/she probably likes 420.)

3/26 13F Filing (At the time \~$16/share)

https://preview.redd.it/vmjt8aqklu271.png?width=2328&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1c6c72c9ce3b788b3762f2d3712b78366a7db13a

&amp;amp;#x200B;

**Exhibit D:** 5/17 Sus now owns 1,188,000 shares, up 2.2x or 768,000 shares in 3 months.

5/17 13F Filing (At the time \~$9/share)

https://preview.redd.it/y9huakfllu271.png?width=2324&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=598e1ec8166776cd06ad17a4a7490e4e85753a9c

&amp;amp;#x200B;

**Questions?**

But wait didn't they buy from $16 to $9, and $15 put with 9000 contracts open? So are they long or are they short?

**1.**) Sus is now a bag holder of WISH at \~ $12, trading at $7.74, that would mean a $4m+ loss on paper if they were to close out. (LONG BAG HOLDER)

**2.**) $15put with 9000 contracts. What a coincidence, owning shares at \~$16. Did someone open a position to push the price down?

It's quite possible that they shorted the price down to buy more shares while holding puts. (Long bag holder and accumulating more shares.)

**3.**)Let's see what hedgy friend is doing. \*enters Citadel

**Exhibit E**: 2/16 Citadel owns roughly 69,000 shares (Price at time $25)

https://preview.redd.it/kkqxrz5mlu271.png?width=2140&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f06df0e7273958c79a5bb4eea63e0c7fbd2790a6

&amp;amp;#x200B;

**Exhibit F:** 5/17 Citadel owns roughly 926,000 shares, 13x increase or +857000 shares(Price at time $8.74)

https://preview.redd.it/ofz102kmlu271.png?width=2144&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1d18321317657b88376a7967c4edffffb7dce0e7

&amp;amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**: Maybe hedgies just made a bad investment and they averaged down? (Sure it's possible, but what are they going to do with all the shares?) Wrong! Push down price, buy more shares, rocketship, profit. Hedgies are about to lift off a rocket secretly but we just got **access to the sneak peak before it goes!**

**TLDR**: When bulls wear bear clothing. Ride them. Wish pummeled so shares can be acquired.

**Position:** Original 5000 shares @ $7.8

Update*
Closed. Bought into GME.

UWMC is the nations #1 wholesale mortgage lender based out of Michigan. They have a variety of advantages over their competitors in the mortgage field. 
I understand a lot of people are trying to move the sub away from chasing short squeezes, however it is worth nothing that this stock is sitting at 20.5% short interest and the borrow rate is quite high https://iborrowdesk.com/report/uwmc .

401,DD,nmofz4,2021-05-28 05:12:37,"Palantir DD if you want to understand company and it's history better (also insider ""selling"" explained in detail)","This started as a comment reply but I thought maybe people would like reading it. I've been researching Palantir since literally late November 2020 and I have nearly my entire portfolio in LEAPS expiring January 2023. So I have continually done more research on them this is just the basics to clear up confusion and help people who don't understand it because it's hard to hear all the hype and stuff. Also AMC to the moon tomorrow for my FDs I bought!! Don't judge me it's just fun to be in on the action on weeks like this.


So you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable. 

They developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.

 It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.

They fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.

Then for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?

 They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. 



They actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit. Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we're going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI. The amount of government money that's going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is. 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201001005334/en/U.S.-Army-Research-Lab-Selects-Palantir-Technologies-Inc.-for-91M-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Development

This is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in. Sure they're going to experiment with other research but if you do research you'll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts. They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6. The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I'm not even sure if there's more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get. 

But like again I'm an obsessive. I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it's very possible and can make them huge and it will. But I'm actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY. And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do. It's literally the next Manhattan project and they're absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest. I think it's funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be. 




Also people got the insider selling stuff very very wrong. Tom Nash (love him or hate him I don't care) has a few really good recent videos where he explains it in basically full detail what was happening. The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion. 

Basically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price. Well because it's the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments. So everytime karp was exercising he's actually buying shares. Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars. shares. And even those when he exercising he's buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE. So over the last year plus this year he's essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit. So his total income which he's getting taxed at 40% of is in the BILLIONS yes billions. Because that's a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there's no issue it's not even like him saying sell today and they do this.... TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC. That's why it's automatically happening so no one can ever claim he's timing it. 

So listen cause here's where it gets important. The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he's receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn't actually get billions of dollars. So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that. Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised. So everytime he's selling low its actually good for him because it's less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on.

 If he wasn't selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall. So if he thought it was going to tank he'd wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes. 

I know this seems really crazy but I promise that's how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors/youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong. Unbelievable I know. If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like $3-6 dollars not low 20s. Retail got confused because of market pressured due to interest rate fears from inflation and sold low (like retail always does) to institutions.",DD,0.91

In case you're looking for some deeper DD, I suggest you check out the other [BCRX DD article](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mtzhp2/bcrx_dd_the_embarrassment_of_riches/) I wrote.

&#x200B;

* **2021 Q1 ER Beat**

On May the 6th, 2021 BCRX presented Q1 Earnings Report data which managed  ***Beat Analysts estimates***. Basically what matters from this ***Q1 ER*** is that it was the ***launch of Orladeyo***, and Analysts wanted to see a decent amount of money generated by it. They were expecting Orladeyo sales to top ***$3.1MM*** and Orladeyo actually generated ***$10.94MM***, this is a ***353% sales beat***

https://preview.redd.it/uppmf8dy09z61.png?width=765&format=png&auto=webp&s=7215a9fc3d12ae2ead2bb782802742ef8ab998cb

The consequence of the ER beat was an increase of **24.06%** in the **SP**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3dhmebmo39z61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8876fcc6c02233d347ec7bab257ef079d5ea74e6

&#x200B;

It's *really important* to mention that **revenues generated this Q1** only came from the **USA**.

This **Q2 Orladeyo** has been **approved in Japan/Europe/UK** aswell, adding new sources of revenue.

&#x200B;

**Orladeyo sales** are expected to **grow exponentially** **each quarter**. Main reason for it is that it has been approved in the countries mentioned above. The other reason is that the amount of **patients** they treat will **slowly score up** as **insurance companies allow** their clients to be treated with this drug.

&#x200B;

The data displayed below shows the amount of patients using Orladeyo in 3 or 4 pharmacies which provide information to Bloomberg. This numbers help us track how Orladeyo's sales evolve, but it's not 100% accurate.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qw97n7ga89z61.png?width=1257&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d353dc8fe919da2f4e10d6c5f68527c7cb7813b

If we sum up the numbers from Q1 we get a total of 43 patients, in the first month of Q2 there are 38 new patients already. Meaning Orladeyo nearly managed to get in a single month all the amount of patients it gathered in Q1, **reasuring the exponential growth.** This numbers will keep rising now that Orladeyo is approved in more countries.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* **Orladeyo**™ **(Berotralstat) oral pill**

&#x200B;

Orladeyo is the ***first Oral approved*** treatment used to prevent swelling attacks in people with ***hereditary angioedema (HAE)*****,** disease which is estimated to affect ***1 in 50,000 people.***

&#x200B;

\- Orladeyo was firstly approved in the ***USA*** ***December the 3rd,*** ***2020. Q4***

\- Orladeyo received ***Japan*** NHI price listing approval ***April the 14th, 2021. Q2***

\- Orladeyo received ***Europe*** approval ***April the 30th, 2021 Q2***

\- Orladeyo received ***UK*** approval ***May the 12th, 2021 Q2***

&#x200B;

***CEO*** himself, Jon Stonehouse ***confirmed*** in the [last conference call, ( 22:15 )](https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/mqqo89/bcrx_biocryst_apr_14_2021_at_845_am_edt_20th/) ***Orladeyo will annually*** be generating ***$500MM Plus revenue.***

&#x200B;

\-Serge Belanger ( ***Analyst*** ): I think in the past you've talked about ***sales potential for Orladeyo of 500 million plus***, are you still reiterating that target?

\- Stonehouse ( ***CEO*** ): ***Yeah make sure you remember the plus.***

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

***Orladeyo*** is [ranked](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/pharmacy/20-most-expensive-prescription-drugs-in-2021.html) the ***#13 most expensive drug*** ***in the USA*** market. ***$37,308*** is approximately what patients ( insurances ) must monthly pay to access the drug.

The fact ***Orladeyo*** is ***taken*** ***orally it's huge.*** Back then before ***Oral Orladeyo*** was approved for HAE, ***patients*** would only have treatments that required usage of ***needles,*** there were ***no other oral treatments approved to treat HAE***. This dramatically ***reduced the*** ***quality of their life***, making some of them stop using the treatment. That's why ***Orladeyo is a game changer***.

As it's shown in[ the January 2021 Corporate Presentation](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 16), Physicians expect to Prescribe ***Orladeyo for over 40% of HAE Patients.***

In the USA there currently are 10,000 patients, ***7500 diagnosed and treated,*** 1700 diagnosed but not treated, 600 treated but not diagnosed.

Physicians expect to prescribe ***Orladeyo for over 41% of HAE patients***. Conservatively thinking, taking 7,500 patients ( the diagnosed and treated ones ) out of the total 10,000 pool in the USA, with over[ 41% of patients prescription](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) ( page 16 ) we would conservatively aim for ***3,075 patients.***

The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in the USA, is equal to ***485,000$***

&#x200B;

**Japan**

On November the 5th Biocryst undergone an agreement with ***Torii Pharmaceuticals.*** A local Japanese company that will be in charge of getting new patients to be treated with Orladeyo in Japan and commerzialing it.

Japan has around 2,500 HAE patients, and Biocryst conservatively expects to ***at*** ***least reach 500 patients.***

The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in Japan, is equal to ***$248,500***

***Approval of Orladeyo in Japan issued a $15MM milestone payment*** from Torii.

***BioCryst will receive*** tiered royalties ranging from ***20% - 40% of Japanese sales.***

&#x200B;

**Europe**

It's estimated to be around ***12,000 HAE patients in Europe.*** Following the physician prescription of over[ 41% of patients to prescribe](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 16) for Orladeyo. We get a total of ***4,920 patients*** in Europe.

Since pricings and jurisdictions work in a different way in Europe, the amount of money each patient will have to pay for Orladeyo is expected to be around or above Japan's ***$248,500/year.*** This number should soon be confirmed.

&#x200B;

**United Kingdom**

It's estimated there are **1500-2000 HAE** patients in there, **1000 of them diagnosed**. Following the physician prescription of over[ 41% of patients to prescribe](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 16) for Orladeyo we should expect to capture 400 patients.

Orladeyo price in UK is expected to be similar to the one in Japan \~ ***$248,500/year***. meaning **$99,400,000** revenue with 400 patients.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

With this yearly prices and the amount of patients defined before, we get the following results.

\- ***USA - 3,075p x 485K = 1,491,375,000$***

\- ***Japan - 500p x 248,5K = 124,250,000$***

\- ***EU - 4,920p x 248,5K = 1,222,620,000$***

**- UK - 400p x 248,5K = 99,400,000$**

Summing it all up we get $2,850,670,000. From that number we have to subtract 123,100,000$ making it a total of ***$2,727,570,000***. The sustraction happens as a result of the undergone Royalty agreement with Torii Pharmaceuticals and Royalty Pharma.

&#x200B;

Having in mind the discussed numbers before, Orladeyo alone will be generating ***$2,727,570,000*** a year, using the average mid-cap Biotech company multiplier **x7**. We get a total of ***$19,092,990,000*** meaning an increase of ***$104,46*** in the stock price. 108.41

 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

***CEO himself confirmed*** multiple times that the company will ***not need to do offerings anymore.*** As shown in the pic below, current cash runaway takes them into 2023.

&#x200B;

* **Conclusion**

We are just about to witness how ***BCRX evolves*** from being an R&D company, to be a commercial stage one. This will mainly happen due to the ***revenue generated by Orladeyo*** and the ***potential of BCX9930.***

Basically from now on ***each ER will be a new catalyst for BCRX.*** Considering how Orladeyo is still in an early launch state the revenue it generates will exponentially keep growing, so will the SP.

***Orladeyo*** undoubtly is an awesome asset for BCRX, a ***cash-cow***. But the one drug in BCRX's pipeline that has the ***most promising future is BCX9930***. An Oral inhibitor in PH3 pivotal studies which treats ***8 different diseases*** as of now, aimming for a potential ***40B market size by 2025***. Deeper information about it can be found in the following article [BCRX - The Embarrassment of Riches](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mtzhp2/bcrx_dd_the_embarrassment_of_riches/).

I currently do have a position in this company, my average entry price being around the 4$ range. In my opinion BCRX probably has the **best risk/reward ratio in the bio-world** and I do not plan to sell my shares yet.",DD,0.81

410,DD,nqxmty,2021-06-03 00:02:22,The Weekly DD - Corsair Gaming (CRSR): Rise of The Gamers," The video game industry has taken off since the pandemic and is expected to reach a value of \~**$290 billion by 2026**. How does this compare to the global box office industry? From 2019 to 2020 we saw revenues shift in the following:

**2019 -> 2020**

*Global Box Office*

\~42 billion (all-time-record) -> \~11.5 billion

*Gaming Industry*

\~152 billion -> \~164 billion

That’s right, in 2019 (pre-pandemic) the gaming industry was already over 3.5x the size of the box office entertainment industry and over 14x in 2020\*. Gaming’s 2020 growth outperformed the growth of both movies and sports combined ([source](https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/video-games-2020-revenues-outpace-movies-sports#:~:text=A%2520new%2520report%2520from%2520MarketWatch,both%2520movies%2520and%2520sports%2520combined.)).

There is a shift in the ecosystem from gaming for fun to becoming more of a social event, ie: hanging with friends *while* playing video games for the hobbyist gamer, and streaming for the professionals. Gaming, once thought to be an activity for the young, has proliferated through all age groups and demographics. In 2020, 64% of all American adults (214.4 million people) played video games ([source](https://venturebeat.com/2020/07/15/esa-ceo-64-of-u-s-adults-are-gamers-46-of-players-are-women-older-people-are-playing-more/))

https://preview.redd.it/mhmyyow5dx271.png?width=1172&format=png&auto=webp&s=30ab577faef9b2abdd438edf9162b5e372a76063

&#x200B;

Check out evolution of streaming platforms since the Pandemic. Out of the top 3 competitors (Twitch, Youtube, Facebook) Twitch was the clear winner here with users streaming and revenues jumping significantly. This massive expansion of total addressable market (TAM) is most likely a one time occurrence, but the gaming industry is still expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of roughly 11% moving forward.

**eSports**

Another beneficiary of the gaming industry boom, which is not talked about enough nor well-understood by many, are eSports. Essentially, eSports are gaming competitions that offer cash as prizes and draw YUGE crowds. The eSports industry alone is set to surpass \~1.1 billion in revenues in 2021, a 14% growth from 2020’s \~950 million. To put things in perspective some of the top eSports events compete with the US Open Tennis and US Open Golf tournaments where the winner takes home *millions* of dollars.

**Enters Corsair Gaming (CRSR)**

What is Corsair Gaming (CRSR)? They are a designer and manufacturer of high-end gear for all things PC gaming. They offer four different segments of products, almost all of which have 5-star ratings on Amazon.

&#x200B;

1. PC peripherals: keyboards, headsets, mice, mousepads, chais, etc.
2. Streaming equipment: green screens, capture cards, microphones.
3. PC components: almost anything outside the graphics card that can be found inside the PC tower (the big metal box that the computer is made of).
4. Gaming PCs for those that don’t want to self-customize their own.

**Corsair - Outlook**

With the rise of gaming comes new opportunity for CRSR to expand its sales. In 2021, the PC gaming market was estimated to be $45.5B with \~50% of all gamers using a PC to play video games ([source](https://fortunly.com/statistics/video-game-industry-statistics/)). This creates a very opportune market for those who can provide value to the PC gamer.

The target market who purchases peripherals are a passionate, well-researched group with access to many other brands. Therefore, only a well-liked (and popular) brand can succeed in this market ([source](https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/gaming-peripheral-branding-data-brands-consumer-research/)). Thus, the market advantages large incumbents over smaller up-and-comers. Their brand value is also obvious in the premiums that their brand allows them to charge. Their gaming components and systems products, which they are currently the market leader, demands an average of \~40% premiums compared to their competitors! This means their products cost 40% more, on average, than their competitors and they are still out-selling them.

**Final Thoughts**

Given the rapid growth of the gaming industry boosted by the COVID-19 pandemic, CRSR is on track to capture a large segment of this growth and expand its business as a result. However, CRSR is not expected to have any massive shifts in its business nor do their growth strategies include any drastic changes to their current strategy. Corsair is a premium brand with solid market penetration. Although they may not experience the same explosive from 2019 to 2020, they are in a great position to remain a market leader in a fast-growing industry.

**Positions:** None right now, but I've sold puts on CRSR over the last 6 months. Will be selling again on next red day.",DD,0.95

Last friday we saw a first attempt to start a new uptrend. The first price target (12$) was reached in less than 24 hours. Subsequently the price got heavily rejected at the resistance level of 12$, forming a bearish candle.

The volume on Friday was much higher than the average. The short sellers tried to push the share price down below the resistance at 12$ in order to avoid a further surge. I assume they are really  scared to see the price above that level because chartwise that means a bullish trend reversal.

Next week Blackberry needs to break the resistance around 12$. Beyond 12$ there is almost no resistance besides the ATH. Furthermore the short interest rose during the consolidation since February. The percentage of float shorted is around 9% now (5/14/2021) which provides additional fuel for a squeeze. That means we could see a fast acceleration of the new uptrend.

&#x200B;

If the share price of $BB falls below the support at 8.5$ the bullish scenario is **not valid** anymore.

**Price targets:**

\#1 12$ ✅ 28th May

\#2 25$

\#3 48$

\#4 🚀🚀🚀

Edit:

Just to make it more clear - I think the price action is going to repeat as you can see in the following chart:

427,SPY,nix3nq,2021-05-23 03:31:33,"In response to : ""Technical Analysis on Smoothed Moving Average (SMMA) indicator in the context of SPY day trading""","This asshat started tolling on my post (my perspective): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ni4vcu/i\_spy\_521\_recap\_and\_524\_outlook/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ni4vcu/i_spy_521_recap_and_524_outlook/)

And then called me out in a post - without calling me out. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nir8an/technical\_analysis\_on\_smoothed\_moving\_average/gz3yo7x/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nir8an/technical_analysis_on_smoothed_moving_average/gz3yo7x/?context=3)

So id just like to give my perspective on what I'm seeing on the charts. Its all in the eye of the beholder so take it as a grain of salt. This TA has helped me make money and, I believe, gives me an edge. But to each his own. If you are making money with your own method then congratulations. Not gonna poo all over you if it doesn't align with my method and strategies.

From the [5/21 read post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nhrou0/i_spy_521_read/)

A few things in TA my notes:

* called support and resistance levels.
* Called small moves
* Called that bulls need to break 418 and test 418 as support. As you can see we failed bulls.
* But bears did not break 414.
* Also called out a 20 SMMA test. Which we tested and failed.

[screen grab from 5\/21 post](https://preview.redd.it/vhi7x1l5or071.png?width=1508&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b7f89491be4eb7f6ab15b0c4e8149d803ada9f0)

From the spot gamma notes:

* look at abs gamma strike and look what was said.

[screen grab from 5\/21 post](https://preview.redd.it/j6xkdqb9pr071.png?width=1398&format=png&auto=webp&s=df15d5b87b146ca6cdf391dbc9fada46db89a1b2)

I'd like to address this chart and comment:

""Now please tell me which SMMA is acting as as support and which one as a resistance here? 60-day SMMA is definitely not a support because SPY was below that line half of the trading hours. 20-day SMMA is not a resistance because SPY was above that line for almost one third of the market hour.""

[ To express what I see I'll provide my chart:](https://preview.redd.it/0ghkrgvhkr071.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=b99e69494648928d9891cb025a1da6b33f94835f)

Let's go back to the 20th first.

* 20 SMMA acted as support and was tested three times throughout the day on the 20th.
* The 20 SMMA would have played as a great indicator to BTFD for Friday.

https://preview.redd.it/1dnhk0s0lr071.png?width=3400&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0dc044b41db5df168ee01cf164486e120281a5

Now lets focus on friday:

* Still have the 20 smma as support in the morning
* broke through 418 with blow-off top but failed to establish support.
* Tested 20 SMMA support at around 8 AM and failed but found support at top of gap (pretty common).
* Tested 20 SMMA as support at 9 AM but failed
* 20 SMMA now acted as resistance from about 9:15 - 11:30 (two fucking hours) Scalpers delight! Easily a 1x-3x bagger on an O'Hare.
* As you can see we bounced off the 120 SMMA and found support.
* The essentially consolidated for the rest of the day. ""*Consolidation* is the term for a *stock* or security that is neither continuing nor reversing a larger price trend. *Consolidated stocks* typically trade within limited price ranges and offer relatively few *trading* opportunities until another pattern emerges.""

https://preview.redd.it/7y89c2awqr071.png?width=3400&format=png&auto=webp&s=83d8c18d5dcf4bd08b12a1ac9e0cb00c0ee9d107

Taking this comment into account: ""Now if you believe in these indicators and bought 0 DTE FD calls as a hope that 60-day SMMA will save you, you know what would happen.""

Let's look at the RSI at the blow off top.  If you started buying O'Hare calls here then you belong in this sub.

https://preview.redd.it/s2vvxf86vr071.png?width=3400&format=png&auto=webp&s=eca2606d4187b2ff947c6d1cfbd713101b2d9d01

TLDR - use basic ta for support and resistance. Use more than one indicator to confirm trends. Read my posts as conditional statements. If you have questions - ask - BUT don't be a dick. I provide bullish and bearish pts because like everyone else I don't know where the market is going to go in the future. SMMAs are a great tool but not good used by themselves. Use them to determine strength of trends IMO. Use them for shorting and buying opportunities off of bounces and rejections.

With publicity from WSB and a boom in volume, there is big potential for WKHS to spike to the 20's and higher.    
A bull flag can be identified on the 30 min chart with the end of Friday leaving us sitting on an important level of support.. which is comforting. Monday premarket will be the deciding factor for if we continue higher or potentially drop back into the wedge. We have a gap fill around the 28.00 area, but this is out of the question until we get over 21.03 (Second Target).    


Here are the levels I am looking at:   
Entry - 13.48   
1st Target - 15.68   
2nd Target - 21.03   
Stop Loss - 12.33    


Wait for a bounce off POC and breakout from 30 min bull flag @ 13.48 for entry. This is a simple play, no need to make it complicated!

EX dividend is literally 6/9 do you need to know anything else? This was made for WSB.

EDIT: I guess I have to do some real DD so automod doesn't ban me. Nobody reads that shit anyways.

Reasons this fucker is going to the moon:

1. They are the top mortgage lender... If you listened to their earnings call it was much different than RKT's. While RKT saw margins damper and guided down for the future, UWMC actually had a completely different tone. Margins were practically unaffected and they probably couldn't have given better guidance. TLDR: Rates go up we dominate competition and market share. Rates stay at these levels we continue to have massive revenues and return that money to the shareholders.
2. Next reason, they actually return money to shareholders! First year on the market and they already pay a dividend and have a massive share repurchase program in the works.
3. Now onto that share buyback program. They announced $300m of share repurchases.... for context when they announced that the entire float was worth $600m... you can see how this might affect price.
4. This company is making nearly 900m a quarter of NET INCOME and is priced at $12b... Show me where else you can find this in this market.
5. As you've already heard a million times by others Wall St is shorting the shit out of this thing for no apparent reason and you best believe they are doubling down after that run up and the recent fed comments on decreased house sales.

TLDR. UWMC going to the moon.... Way over shorted way under priced worst case scenario you are holding something that pays you every quarter and has a track record that lasts decades.

POSITIONS: ROLLED 7.50 calls to 6/18. have about 5 8/20 $6 calls and a shit ton of shares that are paying me every quarter

EDIT: Retards dividends aren't just important for that 10 cents. Stocks like to pump into ex dividend as boomers get interested and pay 50 cents more for a 10 cent dividend.

People have been asking for some real DD on SENS, saw it mentioned a couple times and I've been following it since December, but it's still very early to get in.

We've all seen how $WISH and $CLOV have performed this week based on their float to short float ratio. Wendy was a worthy pump and dump though, and we see how memes can be more than dreams. Seeing Cramer on TV try to make sense of it was quite the distraction. Well, here I come with DD on a similar ratio on $SENS (Senseonics Holdings, Inc.), a biotech/healthcare company much like CLOV.

Biotech/healthcare companies are always risky because they need approval by the FDA, clinical trials and investors need to have a complicated understanding of the science and technologies behind the companies. So easiest laziest thing to do? Short them.  The kind of stuff that halts the U.S. advance in science all the time and why shorting + naked shorting is so scummy for companies that are legit trying to help people.

Why buy into a good company and help it grow as well as your money, when you can make double or more the $$$ by shorting it to the ground until bankruptcy? Don't have to cover your shorts either AND maybe get some easy assets while at it??!!💸📉

Here you can see how SENS is trending upward since it's breakout last week and has been testing multiple supports for months now.

# SHORTS, FLOAT and outstanding shares

Here is the data for SENS according to [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SENS&ty=c&ta=1&p=d](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SENS&ty=c&ta=1&p=d)

&#x200B;

As you can see, SENS has about 80m less float than WISH and 160m more than CLOV with a 25.8% SHORT on that float. We can see that we can have a price movement which could be between WISH's and CLOV movement this week.

$SENS also has quite a low market cap of only 1.5B take or give. It's also not under any major ETF, and the ones that own it only have about 3m shares total, so it cant be fucked from major ETFs movements.

Low insider ownership as well

**🦧SHORT VOLUME ""It'S nOt iMpoRtAnt""🦧 :**

Short volume is important to see how shorts operate everyday. If for exemple your price is 20$ but shorts have entered at 25$, they're comfortable. But as we can see here, they are always shorting about 50% from the current price. That means they didnt have much positions open higher. So it should be easy to push right now.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q8ccdhxqu9471.png?width=1052&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffa4d3baa6c736eb43df086e4582138c29a1bc47

As you can see here, whenever SENS makes a move up, everyday, it's almost always above 30% to 50% shorted on the volume of the day, so automatic market orders most likely, which means that as soon as buy pressure starts coming in we're gonna have some shorts that will enter, things is they won't know that this buy pressure comes from a mass amount of retarded apes, so the algorithms or whatever the fuck will kick in to short the volume as if it's everyday normal buy pressure... They'll get pushed back and squeezed to cover.

# FUNDAMENTALS

Founded in 1996 and serves the United States, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.

SENS has recently traded up last week after a successful trial of a new CGM system (monitoring system for diabetes), that's why you see the price up from last week. Broke their penny stock class up to above 3 dollars.  


EDIT: New info thanks to /u/Murky-Sweet7666

> *FDA timeline : I see you saying  July/August in the comments. 1-2 months is absolute best case scenario.  Most people think it will happen around October due to the FDA only  starting approval on April 15 this year due to covid, and it is a 180  day product. It could take as long as the end of the year (again 180 day  product), or more if the FDA wants more data. I don't think the FDA  will want more data as they just aced their recent long-term study with  flying colors, but it is a risk.*  
>  
>*The  product is better than what you are selling in this article. Currently  the market leader in CGM (dexcom) has their main device which is an  external wearable that needs replaced every 12-14 days. Senseonics  Eversense 180 (soon to be FDA approved) will last 180 days(!) and is  implanted in the back of the upper arm. Senseonics has also stated they  are already well into development of a 365 day version which they plan  to only need calibrated once per week!  (365 approval probably 3-7 years  away)*  
>  
>*Dexcom's  market cap is pushing 39bil as of close today and a stock price of  nearly $400. Someday at least a large chunk (if not most) of that seems  poised to be in Senseonics hands. Even with the 180 day it seems likely  they will start to take large chunks of market share.*

So, not only are they successful in their technologies, they have been in the business long term and help people across the world. They are putting forward a chip that lodges underneath the skin and connect to your mobile device to monitor your glucose levels by Bluetooth. Instant access and always on you. So why are they shorted again? Oh yeaahh, easy target as all healthcare companies are as usual. Especially in these hard times since the pandemic..

# SO TL;DR🚀🌛

* Easy squeeze from high short interests and everyday volume
* Low float to grab and high short float
* Cheap af right now with upwards movement driven by success in the company
* Low insider ownership
* Founded in 1996 and serves the United States, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa
* Broken price resistances and tested them three times on the daily
* Is currently above that same resistance based on fundamentals, so with some help it can go to the next one and through easily to moon
* Trending above 200 EMA for close to 7 months now
* Both long term and short term plays
* Some mentions here and there, current interest in the price is backed by fundamental and mutual funds so perfect time to get in
* They have a much better product than their competitor (Chip that stays for 180 days under the skin without ill effects) and they are developing a 365 days one. So far their product has been accepted in Europe as well so it is very likely that the FDA will approve it since they passed their test with ""flying colors"" as /u/Murky-Sweet7666 would say.

I want to call attention to the fact that GME has been consolidating for 2 months and looks just about ready to launch. Check the chart below courtesy of traderstewie. For months GME has been tightening and building higher lows on the daily and weekly. The key level to break out of the wedge is \~190 which we're pretty much exactly at now. Above $190 the path looks open to $300+.

GME is starting to look like a rocket launch site. The only thing missing is volume.

I like the stock, but do your own due diligence. There is always uncertainty. Don't speculate with $ you can't afford to lose.

Update (7:45pm) -

Well, GME broke the hell out of its channel. Don't believe the reports talking about a squeeze. The squeeze has not squoze. You'll know it's squeezing when the price shoots up dramatically. And each squeeze makes the next one more likely. Don't expect a smooth ride but I don't see much resistance from here to $300.

Since CLOV reached its ATH from the activity yesterday new short positions had to be opened in order for hedge funds to prevent further losses. The shorts are already under a lot of pressure as the share price is higher than any of their previous short positions unlike all of the ""tHE neXt BiG sQwEEz"" plays you retards have been posting for the last 24 hours.

I read through the DD and understand why the OP had their post pulled down. That being said, the content is solid and I think its worth repeating. I have edited the below DD to remove the parts that were maybe a little too over-eager.

$UWMC ULTIMATE DD

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC. The massive 5.75% dividend. Their insanely LOW P/E of about 3.9 and their insane income growth. 4,200% increase in net income! 🚀 (No that’s not a typo)

So why would any one want to buy this stock right now ?

The CEO is a beast. And not only did they reaffirm their dividend (ex date in June) and just make $860M in the first quarter, they announced the approval of a $300M stock buy back. That’s big money ! But let’s dive deeper. The $300M share buy back is of the class A shares that are in the float. $UWMC has a very small float.

104M shares. $300M / $6.70 = 45M. That means at current prices they can buy back nearly 44% of the entire F\*\*kin float. You have never heard of that before and you probably never will again. On earnings call yesterday CEO says “We can start buying shares tomorrow and I am a buyer at this price !”

So that leaves 60M shares left in the float. Institutions own 23M of them (I bet it’s higher) short interest is close to 13M based on latest data.

This just caused the borrow rate to increase by 5X ! new data shows short borrow rates just hit 25%

Apes, there are less than 35M shares freely traded in this stock right now.

On top of all this we still have Russell Inclusion to be announced in June and another blow out 2Q is in the works.

This is NOT financial advice but I can't think of a reason I shouldn’t park a few dollars in a highly profitable stock, trading at all time lows, paying a 6% dividend with a current p/e under 4?

My position 7900 shares @ 7.64 and 45x 6/18 8c

TL,DR 🏘=💵💵💵💵 = UWMC 🚀🚀🚀🤑  


Edit: since I posted there are only 2,000 shares to loan and the borrow rate is 35%!!?!??

Dear retards,

Today  I was doing my DD’s and while doing my wacc, roe and other bullshit  analysis I had the smart idea to have a look at the Short Interest of  sndl.

While looking at it I was  astonished by the data reported by Bloomberg terminal. Our  short-interest ratio is 1.44, while amc is only 0.53 and gme 1.45  (source: Bloomberg terminal).

This means that the number of shorted shares is 1.44 times higher than the average trading volume which is absolutely crazy!!!!

The  percentage of the float is around 15%, however, the data of float  percentage has not been updated yet. IMO we could easily be at around  20, as gme and amc.

The main thing differentiating us from AMC and GME is the SI Score provided by Bloomberg terminal à 2nd

amc is just 5th whereas gme 4th

To conclude the S3 rate temperature, indicating the seasoned financing levels with 1, 50 or 100

1= Liquid borrows typically indicating a short interest at or below historic terms

50= Marginally higher borrow levels typically indicating somewhat elevated short interest

100= Increased borrow levels typically indicating elevated short interest.

We  are currently at 50, ( gme stands at 1 (source Bloomberg terminal)) and  even in this case, the data have not yet been updated from the previous  month….

The SQUEEZE is near we all need to hold sundial !!!!

Cheers and have a good day y’all degenerates

Everything looked to have gone off successfully. We are now waiting on the data and craft to be analysed and inspected. This will take a few weeks according to Michael Colglazier.
That being said he had already outlined the test schedule in the earnings zoom call.

1st test flight - may 
2nd crewed flight - June 
3rd flight with R Branson on board late June/July 

4th flight this will be taking the Italian airforce on a training mission (600k a seat) late July


On the run in to the first test flight some possible maintenance issues appeared with the carrier plane White knight 2…. 
This indeed could have gone either way , after 2 weeks inspections it was decided that WK2 did not need to delay testing no maintenance was needed at this point. Scheduled Maintenance will commence in the fall after all tests have been completed.
Upon this news it is my opinion that the testing programme will go ahead as planned.

The market has responded accordingly and the stock is now up from $17-€31

With all these catalysts lined up before the end of the year and commercial operations looming for early 2022 things are looking up for Virgin Galactic.The success of the last test flight the company have now proven tech and concept. 
Also with revenue now coming in Nasa who are conducting micro gravity analysis.
Also international training for military pilots and astronauts.
Commercial flights look imminent.

484,WKHS,nrik0e,2021-06-03 19:11:34,"WKHS is the most heavily shorted stock, 6/3/21","Workhorse Group (WKHS) As of today, it is shorted at nearly 42% of float. This seems to me to be the next runner from AMC and GME. 

Both GME and AMC were hugely shorted previously when the rallies started, and now that short interest has decreased. It still is there but has decreased and that's why I think we've seen momentum change.

Today, AMC took a massive hit due to the company offering nearly 12 million stocks for purchase which hurt many peoples wins and likely some that hasn't invested sooner. 
Edit: this above paragraph apparently is inaccurate, it was misinformation posted on a news article today that was misleading. Apparently there was no selloff.
Edit 2: renig here. Apparently it is confirmed that the 11.5millipn shares were selling today, which naturally would've contributed to the amc sell off. Multiple news outlets I've found state the same not referencing any April date. This is a discussion post. This is the most up to date and accurate info I can seem to find.

I expect GME and AMC will likely both continue to increase if stocks are held. But based on short interest alone, it would seem to me that WKHS is next in line for the biggest squeeze meaning it has the biggest short term gains to be had.

WKHS was trading for around $10-$11 yesterday and is nearly $15/share currently.

496,A,nirao8,2021-05-22 22:26:23,$SPCE TA - Broke Out Of A Major Setup Friday - To The Moon!,"We all know about the successful flight and everyone is expecting some moonage next week - so I just wanted to provide some **unbiased** TA. Keep in mind technicals are not a crystal ball, they are a **road map.** I do not hold a position *(although if I looked at the chart Friday, I would).*

[$SPCE 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/c32m1rk5eq071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d477968e5afc2875bca36a471e1c77bd84adcbd)

Here you can see we **broke out of a large descending wedge on Friday** (with fantastic volume). This is the same pattern damn near every speculative growth stock has been caught in for the past few months. Normally it has a bearish bias - because it is coming from downside. However, in this scenario - **it broke up -** which means **we can see some fantastic follow through to the upside.**

The price targets for this setup would be **22.61, 26.18, 28.05, 29.71.** These are all resistances - and in a normal situation you would either trim as we run into these, or scale in as we clear them.

However - given the news catalyst - it's hard to say how high we will gap up on Monday. Above that last level is **34.84** and **36.63.** It's unlikely we cross these without an insane short squeeze, or another pattern forming (at least on the shorter term charts).

Remember, each time we clear one of these levels on a **daily close -** it will become a support. As a result, you can trail your stop loss below them as we continue.

This is one of many examples of **""technicals precede news""** I have encountered throughout my trading career - and one of the reasons I try to ignore anything except for the charts while I am trading. It's hard to quantify arbitrary events - and especially hard to do so without bias. Thankfully, we will often **break out of a major pattern prior to a news release -** like you see here.

I'll be looking to day trade this stock next week depending where we open.

***TL;DR*** \- $SPCE broke out Friday & has positive news to help it along next week

Price targets are **22.61, 26.18, 28.05, 29.71**

*Not Financial Advice*

EDIT: Rejected off of 26.18 and going for the gap fill - re-entry would be on a daily close above that level. After a gap fill you want to see something take out the previous high.",Technical Analysis,0.84
497,IPO,nvncdw,2021-06-09 06:38:16,WELL Health Is The Canadian CLOV... Now They're Doing a NASDAQ IPO with Fenwick &amp; West who Just Completed The COIN IPO!!!,"Obviously CLOV has gotten all the attention as of recent. CLOV was up 85% today and had volume over 732M. The reddit army has taken charge and sent CLOV to truly to the moon. 

I want to share what I think is lining up to be the next CLOV... 

Still largely under the radar is Vancouver based WELL Health Technologies (TSX:WELL) which also has significant short interest, strong fundamentals , and billionaire backers. They just completed a $206M acquisition of “MyHealth” now making it the largest private clinic operator in Canada.

Just prior to that, the company recently announced the $372.9M Acquisition of CRH medical which significantly increased WELLs footprint in the US... This is where it gets interesting. Not only did JP Morgan extend there existing credit line to CRH medical by USD$100M to $300M and RBC provide a C$200M secured credit facility for the recent “MyHealth” acquisition. 

But the company legit partnered with Fenwick & West to assist with a NASDAQ IPO in Q4 of this year.... Fenwick client base is Facebook, Amazon, Cisco, and recently COIN... We are on a launch pad waiting to take off. 

Jumping into the charts now... WELL has consolidated for a year while they have exponentially grown the fundamentals of the business. Just recently they blew through every moving average.

RSI is still below 60% and heading in the right direction - Stochastics finally hit that oversold zone and have started to aggressively turn bullish. 

&#x200B;

Today we saw the stock find new support on the 50day SMA for a strong close.

I think it's very likely we see this breakout of its consolidation period tomorrow and find new support above 8.50 which would set it up for a potential Squeeze/Run into new ATH.

The sky is really the limit here as the company approaches $500M in revenue with Positive EBITDA and a NASDAQ IPO on the horizon. I think it has the potential to be 1 of 2 things. 

1. The next CLOV as it has high short interest and all the same if not better fundamentals
2. A smart diversification tool (Geographically & Financially) for everyone that just made Huge gains on CLOV.",Discussion,0.72
