0,RKT,nvgtc8,2021-06-09 00:45:55,RKT about to repeat history.,"IMO RKT is about to repeat history! 

Its following what appears to be the exact same set up as last time. Small spiratic gains, then shorted heavily. Then its rinse and repeat until the shorts start losing ground. The last time the bears were this out of ammo was the last GME and AMC skyrocketed end if February. 

I'm getting deja vu. 

This stock has hit its tipping point today in my opinion by breaking through the 21 dollar wall. It appears that the shorts covered then reapplied at 21.20 which we just broke through again. This was exactly what was happening from what I can tell last time she gamma squeezed. 

Now with multiple stocks skyrocketing all in the same week, the hedge funds holding this down are extremely weak. RKT has been gaining volume the last week. RKT is a powder keg about to go off! The one major difference between this stock and the ""MEMES"" Is that ROCKET makes money, a shit ton of money.  

Now I understand that we dont have the dividend news we had last time. I get that. But I think with the continuing pressure we still see another massive spike in RKTS future!


Edit: RKT gapped up from 21.30 to 22.40 AH I think it's starting. Whose ready for half Christmas?!!

For comparison, $GME is estimated as 24% 

And $AMC is 21%

Now, we all know these are not 100% known quantities as some things are happening behind closed doors (good job, SEC), but it's interesting to see that the more $BB has gone up, the more it is being shorted (scroll down to see it increasing every day on Fintel).

And what was silly at first has now become a real possibility for a $BB short squeeze happening. I believe it has gone from 9% to 24% since this push started.

This also helps explain how the movements of these stocks are so lockstep recently, especially $BB and $AMC. The hedge funds are acting on them in a similar fashion.

$GME's daily movement is similar but slightly different, likely as such a higher entry cost now.

12,MNMD,nh3khq,2021-05-20 17:43:36,Argument for MNMD,"Mind Medicine is currently undervalued as a biotech company...

\- Research coming out of John Hopkins University is suggesting that the use of Psilocybin is the most effective drug ever tested as a remedy for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. As the United States is currently under crisis in its battle against mental illness, these results are too impressive to ignore, even if it may need to overcome pressures from big pharma interest groups that seek to quell the expansion of this research.

\- These drugs have been extremely effective in treating addiction -- particularly alcohol and nicotine. Considering the government expenditure on the opioid crisis, once this proves to be an effective treatment, the government will expedite the medicinal legalization of the substances that MNMD has been treating/experimenting with.

\- Veterans, the most respected occupational category (statistically,) have begun launching advocacy groups for the widespread medicinal legalization of these substances due to their effectiveness against PTSD. These therapeutic measures have contributed to the plummeting of suicide rates (those treated w/ psilocybin vs. control group.) The Biden administration will have to choose ethics and reason over the suffering of veterans (former government employees) which I anticipate that they will given mounting pressure due to the effectiveness of these treatments.

&#x200B;

Does this hinge on expected earnings in the long-run ... certainly!

&#x200B;

But the effectiveness of this research is undeniable and can no longer be overlooked ... because of new cultural acceptance of these alternative treatments the government's hand will be forced in legalize, or otherwise be responsible for mental illness and addiction -- all of which could be treated and cured.

15,CLOV,nv3xfz,2021-06-08 15:23:38,$CLOV - Will the Real Meme Please Stand Up?,"Given all the hype lately around meme-ageddon and the explosion in price movement, volume, and sentiment around everyone's favorite ""meme"" stocks lately, I thought I'd do a simple (really, really simple) comparative analysis based on 6 month charts of some of go-to tickers.

**My purpose in doing so?** To see if we can establish a trend and differentiate these stocks in any meaningful way.

**Why do I think this is important?** The ""squeeze"" narrative has been used a lot since Jan following the parabolic movements of several stocks. Since then, I feel that all ""squeeze"" and ""meme"" stocks have been psychologically grouped as the same, but their trends show they are not.

**The simple hypothesis?** We should be able to easily differentiate the Jan stocks as compared to any of the others that gained attention post-January.

There was a defined and unique occurrence that took place back in Jan surrounding $GME, $AMC, $BB, $KOSS, $NOK, $BBBY, and Express. Since then, we have seen a wave of ""short squeeze"" narratives for other tickers, but the difference around the January stocks was how they appeared to all move in tandem and have a relatively strong correlation, setting them apart, and potential pointing to some broader scheme involved utilizing naked shorting and resulting in massive FTDs.

It goes to say this is an anomaly and I believe these stocks should be looked at differently when compared with other ""squeeze"" and ""meme"" stocks being pushed.

**Side Note:** For these charts, all tickers will be set to full screen scaling on Trading View in order to see how closely their trends in price action move together, so it's not comparative of current price per share but of their general movements, when those movements took place, and individual gains.

Some of the ""squeeze"" stocks that followed January's events, $CLOV, $RKT, and $MVIS, compared with $GME over a 6 month basis. $GME because it was the most notable Jan stock historically until recently.

&#x200B;

[It may not be as apparent from this first picture, but there is divergence in these stocks trends. I would argue the second half of the chart appears more correlated because everything became sentimentally grouped together as \\""meme\\"" stocks after the MSM started pumping WSB narratives for everything.](https://preview.redd.it/3jgm7j8rl1471.png?width=3335&format=png&auto=webp&s=457655244d8a809517d4a68c9ce168804f2d2f41)

It may not be as apparent from this first picture, but there is divergence in these stocks trends. I would argue the second half of the chart appears more correlated because everything became sentimentally grouped together as ""meme"" stocks after the MSM started pumping WSB narratives for everything.

**What can I infer from this, just from looking at it?**

$CLOV has done its own thing until closer to late March when it first started getting attention (again) after the massive influx of WSB participants post-Jan. Even so, if you look close enough, it has peaks and valleys that move against the trend of $GME.

$MVIS also definitely follows its own tune.

$RKT is actually the one of these 3 that looks like it could follow $GME, but it didn't ""squeeze"" in Jan with the others. It had a massive run up in the beginning of March that sticks out against the others.

It appears to me that it was really around March that this psychological collective was starting to be established as we see a little less divergence in trends, though they are still identifiable as different.

Now compare $GME and $AMC. Although $AMC didn't run up in March, if you study these lines, you can see there consistent moves up and down at the same time as $GME until recently May.

&#x200B;

[AMC bucked the trend the past few weeks and reached highs greater than the Jan peak.](https://preview.redd.it/fwbvwknvl1471.png?width=3323&format=png&auto=webp&s=330b350435447aabf0827de1b0f003ccb5e20d32)

AMC bucked the trend the past few weeks and reached highs greater than the Jan peak.

The other 3 without $GME on the chart.

[Kinda all over the place when you look at them in isolation and compared to each other.](https://preview.redd.it/af55m8gxl1471.png?width=3325&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1ceacfa257d8c8db7ec97530f0f5e3143a53221)

&#x200B;

Kinda all over the place when you look at them in isolation and compared to each other.

Now if you're not sure there seems to be that much divergence, look at the Jan stocks together.

&#x200B;

[Because Big Money got scared and said fuck you](https://preview.redd.it/fk3i4r6am1471.png?width=3324&format=png&auto=webp&s=2806febf5c6904813f452ea47f165a322418f85e)

January peak when they triple fucked us says it all.

This may be a shoddy effort to show the differences I'm trying to highlight, but I think if anyone were to take the time to play around with some charts and overlay the tickers, you can see just from basic visual analysis that there is extreme similarity in all of the Jan stocks over 6 months, suggesting they are in their own bucket entirely independent of other ""meme"" stocks.

If we take the time to compare Jan stocks 1 on 1 with others, it highlights this difference.

I'll use Express here because no one talks about it but it has Jan stock correlation. This tells me that it isn't sentiment driven and is seemingly moving with other Jan stocks for another reason that isn't ""retail"" pumping it.

&#x200B;

[Express and CLOV](https://preview.redd.it/ns66q7mzl1471.png?width=3337&format=png&auto=webp&s=a43dc1801e4f19503b88e13e7850d6cf09a01eea)

**Why did I bother to go through all of this?**

I think it's important to provide some distinction between the events of Jan and those respective stocks as compared to the more recent favorites. I'm not saying what will or will not ""squeeze,"" but I do think it's important to separate the narratives around ""meme"" stocks when evaluating risk and trying to understand what influences a particular stock.

If this wasn't so long already and if I had the character limit, I'd give my interpretation of the time line, when and why certain narratives formed, and how it's important, but I think the charts says enough.",Discussion,0.71
16,UWMC,nw121b,2021-06-09 19:15:07,UWMC will squeeze,"$UWMC will squeeze for the following reasons:
1. Major shareholders have zero intention to sell as the company is extremely profitable and they even issued a $300M share buyback program that started in May 21.
2. Long holders will not sell, the stock is issuing a 4%+ dividend on July 6th and most of that will probably be auto-reinvested into the stock.  The company has Triple digit YOY growth and q1 2021 was the best ever.
3. There is a 22% short interest on float.  This is extremely high on a profitable company.
4.  The real reason this will squeeze is because the cost to borrow is a staggering 38%. Together with the love from long holders, the $300m share buyback program and high interest on every single stock message board, this is looking to be the absolutely best squeeze possibility. 

In fact Fintel has UWMC at a higher squeeze score than even CLOV.  We all saw what CLOV did.  Get in UWMC and make the dream come true.

EDIT with some stats for newcomers to UWMC:
146% YOY Revenue Growth
136% YOY Income Growth

Not only that but unlike some other short traps (like WISH which had a very low float so short % was artificially high), WISH's float is 85% of its shares outstanding so the short interest cannot be lowered simply by releasing shares from lockup. 

This all sets up for a massive squeeze in a short time span as short sellers simply cannot pay such a high borrow rate especially with shorts being targeted, the panic will set in soon and this will easily take off to $25 or higher.

Disclaimer: this is not financial advice.

I‚Äôm big on studying trends and I believe I have found a 2-3 bagger for you retards. I‚Äôve been following $RIDE for about 2 months now, and I noticed the potential for a short squeeze beginning to form last week. I‚Äôve noticed the propensity to squeeze comes from the following criteria:

* Short % of float must be over 20% ([over 28% of $RIDE‚Äôs float is short](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ride); probably closer to 30-32% since it was last updated)
* Small/Mid Cap stocks with considerable growth prospects ($RIDE has a $1.6B market cap) in a hyper-growth EV industry
* Heavily controversial stock, meaning some say it is way overvalued, some say it is undervalued

These stocks tend to be the most volatile. The charts are often comical to even look at (feel free to check out $RIDE‚Äôs 6-month chart for reference).

**$MVIS comparison:**

Taking a look at $MVIS, I noticed that Hindenburg research targeted them in a short & distort attack a few months ago.

I actually googled ‚ÄúHindenburg MVIS‚Äù and the second article that popped up was titled ‚ÄúTechnically Incompetent Short Seller Hindenburg Makes False Statements About MicroVision.‚Äù This bodes very poorly for Hindenburg, as they seem to have started to formulate a lot of their claims out of thin air.

More recently, Hindenburg targeted $RIDE with the same tactics. They called out $RIDE‚Äôs pre-orders for their trucks, while almost all EV companies are utilizing pre-orders, this[ has been clear ever since $RIDE went public](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/16/2127140/0/en/Lordstown-Motors-Releases-Business-Updates-Remains-on-Track-to-Begin-Production-of-the-Lordstown-Endurance-in-September-2021.html) last year.

I found a good[ rebuttal post for Hindenburg‚Äôs attack on $RIDE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkt7qi/the_bullcase_for_lordstown_motors_corporation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on this sub from not too long ago as well.

**$RIDE Intro:**

Lordstown Motors ($RIDE) is currently developing their [full-size all electric Endurance truck](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/endurance). They have an[ experienced management team](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/corporate-governance/management) with multiple execs from companies like Tesla, Volkswagen, GM, Honda, etc; also, GM‚Äôs investment in exchange for their [massive 6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/) helped them hit the ground running. They are targeting commercial fleets and government contracts with their truck initially. Their trucks will be $45,000 after tax credits and get a 75mpg equivalent. They also will require very little maintenance as they utilize true 4 wheel drive with hub motors in each wheel.

Discussing their[ full-year 2020 results](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020) on March 17th, $RIDE management confirmed that ‚ÄúTimeline to Start of Production (SoP) in September 2021 remains on track, with beta prototype build underway and the first beta vehicles to be ready by the end of March; vehicles to be sent for durability, crash, validation, and lighting testing with various partners and to early initial customers for feedback.‚Äù

He called it ‚Äú‚Äòbull\*\*\*\*. I mean it was just to me, it seemed like a hatchet job for (short-sellers) to make money,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd look, I mean (Lordstown) is threatening the status quo. And a lot of people are going to bet against them, figuratively and literally. It comes with the territory. You don‚Äôt get to the top of the mountain without a bunch of people trying to drag you down.‚Äù

[Secretary of State Frank LaRose](https://www.vindy.com/news/local-news/2021/03/ceo-extols-positives-of-lordstown-motors-on-heels-of-critical-report/): ‚ÄúI think what this is, is an opportunity to take a challenging circumstance from just a few years ago and turn it into a truly unique and amazing opportunity for not right here in the Youngstown area ‚Äî Voltage Valley as we like to call it ‚Äî but all over Ohio.‚Äù

[Ohio Governor Mike Dewine:](https://www.cleveland.com/open/2020/06/gov-mike-dewine-said-he-expects-success-from-lordstown-plant-in-first-normal-press-conference-during-pandemic.html) ‚ÄúReally, this is the future,‚Äù DeWine said of the truck and the facility, where he got a private tour. ‚ÄúI think this truck has a great competitive advantage over its competitors.‚Äù

[Senator Michael Rulli](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), the Republican state senator from the area, has introduced several bills in Ohio aimed at helping the electric-vehicle industry, said he‚Äôs visited the (Lordstown) plant recently. He said he‚Äôs seen the company‚Äôs robotic assembly line putting together a series of 57 betas. Based on what he‚Äôs seen, Rulli said he thinks Lordstown Motors will be producing thousands of Endurance trucks sometime this year or perhaps early next year. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre way way way far along,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhoever wrote that article (Hindenburg) has never been in that (Lordstown) plant. That is a fact. Anyone who was in that plant would read that article and think it was garbage.‚Äù

**I WILL NOW SCREAM IT FOR ALL OF YOU: ALL OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TO $RIDE‚ÄôS**[ **MASSIVE 6.2 MILLION SQUARE FOOT FACILITY**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/lordstown-motors-races-to-revive-shuttered-ohio-gm-plant.html)**. $RIDE IS LEGIT AND WILL BE PRODUCING ELECTRIC PICK-UP TRUCKS FOR COMMERCIAL FLEET CUSTOMERS IN JUST 4 MONTHS.**

They also [recently announced ‚ÄúLordstown Week‚Äù](https://businessjournaldaily.com/lordstown-motors-stock-climbs-14-on-lordstown-week-announcement/) in mid June for analysts, customers, partners, and investors to attend. This will silence all of the short-sellers, lawsuits, and FUD.

$RIDE has an earnings call tomorrow 5/24 where they will be giving updates on crash testing. If they announce they are still on track for mass production in September, this will be HUGE.

**$RIDE Upcoming Catalysts include:**

* [Earnings call tomorrow 5/24](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-announces-timing-first-quarter-2021-financial) to discuss updates on crash testing and timeline to production.
* [Department of energy Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (ATVM) loan](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759546/000110465921037690/tm2110022d1_ex99-1.htm), which should be announced by the end of Q2 2021 (literally any day now).
* [Release of ERV in conjunction with Camping World](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2021/01/lordstown-motors-to-reveal-electric-commercial-van-this-summer/), which is expected next month, and the[ Camping World CEO has already leaked a sneak peak](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1379433681995984905?s=20) of it.
* Beta production updates and contracts with commercial fleets.

**Summary:**

$MVIS moved from $10 to $27 in just a couple of days, and I believe $RIDE is about to make a similar move from $10 back to $20+ with their earnings call being tomorrow after-hours.

EVs are front and center, and the government is pushing for the adoption of EVs in such a big way that you‚Äôd be a fool not to own a piece of the pie.

$RIDE has one of the lowest market caps out of all of the EV plays, and they are the closest to fully automated mass production (this September).

Position: 5 Jan 2023 calls w/ a $40 strike. I‚Äôm planning to buy more tomorrow before earnings.

**TL;DR:**

$RIDE stock has incredibly high upside, and I think it‚Äôs only a matter of time until it squeezes back up to the $20‚Äôs. I have been following the chart for a while now, and I believe institutions are currently loading up before this gets squeezed back up.

31,SNDL,nn326f,2021-05-28 19:33:28,MORE ACT / CANNABIS / $SNDL &amp; $TLRY Potential,"What up peeps. I want to cover two tickers here, $SNDL which currently meets the sidebar rules with today's move. 1.6B market cap and is trading above $1. I get it mods, you gonna mod but I'll keep writing. The other is the infamous $TLRY.   


The News...

If you haven't read yet it looks like Federal Cannabis legalization my be around the corner. [Here](https://www.mpp.org/policy/federal/the-more-act/) is the House Bill. Supporters seem on board and like the reforms they have done to the bill including rescheduling cannabis. [Last time](https://mjbizdaily.com/key-us-house-lawmaker-reintroduces-federal-marijuana-legalization-bill/) the bill was introduced it cleared the House.   


Personally I think this gets a lot of support especially from a fiscal point of view. With stimulus stalling and a giant debate going on about how to pay for the stimulus I think cannabis offers the easiest way to collect federal revenue. A simple review of the bill and the fiscal benefits to the Fed's can be read [here](https://www.justtherealnews.com/congress/nadler-blumenauer-lee-jackson-lee-jeffries-velazquez-reintroduce-comprehensive-marijuana-reform-legislation/). The bill states a 5% fed tax. Money coming for uncle Sam, right when questions about paying for stimulus.... Personally I think it adds up, but that's for you to decide. 

Okay so that's the hype...

Let's talk about the tickers listed ($SNDL and $TLRY). 

$SNDL

I'll start with the cheaper YOLO, $SNDL. $SNDL short interest isn't high, but the company did issue convertible notes a while back around .7c if my memory is correct. I'm not saying they won't do it again, but they should be in a good place fiscally for now. Float is high with about 1.6B shares out there. However today's volume at the time of writing is over 415M. That's not bad given such a high float. It's about 200% more than the average volume. 

The options chain on $SNDL has me giddy. With over 200,000 options currently in the money on todays move above $1 there is some high potential here for some interesting action. The put to call ratio is just obnoxiously low at .08 it's screaming upwards betting. If we hold above $1 the potential squeeze up could be amazing.   


It's also broken up on the trend lines and out of the downward channel it was in. The regression channel from the peak squeeze back in Feb just broke out today according to my crayons I have laying around. 

$TLRY

$TLRY was the squeeze of a lifetime if you remember it back in 19'. The ticker was just a money printer with it's low float and stupid hype. Then they proceeded to do, like they all do, and issue debt. Shares tumbled since then falling from $120 --> $5. Ouch bag holders.   


Like all the cannabis stocks the Feb bump pushed $TLRY to above $60 in an amazing move. $TLRY has a lower short interest than $SNDL, but it also has a much lower float at about 300M. Compared to $SNDL the volume here isn't as good, but still remains decently above the avg volume around 36M as of right now. 

If we peep the options chain we also see a crazy low P/C ratio around .11. But we don't have the Open Interest in the chain like $SNDL does unless you roll out to Jun 18. Then we finally get some decent OI.   


Personally I am going with $SNDL. The option's chain looks better, the stock is cheaper, and the short interest is a little better. My advice would be to roll out till at least the Jun 11th $1 strike to not get eaten alive by Theta and IV crush. But WSB does what WSB wants and that's why I love you all.   
Do not go above the $2 strikes IMO. You will get crushed by theta unless we get an insane move, which could happen but I don't see the risk / reward there.",Discussion,0.91
32,UWMC,neetnp,2021-05-17 14:23:47,$200K all-in because I believe that $UWMC is undervalued. CEO agreed undervalued and declared a buyback to retire class A float (only class that gets dividends). BULLISH trend this week!," 

I  have shared my thoughts on UWMC in past. The company announced Q1  earnings and while they look like they are below expectations it was  explained by the CEO that because of the speed of their execution, their  results are reflective of the higher rate environment already while  competitors are lagged.

During    the Q4 2020 earnings call he  had mused about options that would be on    the stable, special dividend,  buyback or raising the dividend.

**Feb Q4 Earnings Quote:**

The     Board did approve a dividend, a $0.10 quarterly dividend to be  paid    on  April 6 for all shareholders of record as of March 10. **We expect  this to be a regular quarterly dividend**.

And     so you guys know how we're thinking about this. Our balance sheet   is  a   fortress. And our current liquidity position is very strong, and    we   have access to the capital markets as well. The way we think  about   this   going forward is we're producing a lot of cash. We're  going to   maybe   be more profitable than some expected and be very  successful in   2021.   And **if we have excess cash that I and the Board deem is too much,  we will be delivering that back**. And whether we have to **change     the  dividend in the future, as in raise it or a special dividend,     those  things are definitely on the table or even buying back shares**.

**May Q1 Earnings Quote:**

As     you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of      $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a      record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I always  **explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special  dividend or a share buyback program**. As you guys have seen, we **concluded      share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward   shareholders.    We announced the authorization of $300 million share   buyback over the    next 24 months**.  And **quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that**.

**Then in answering a question from an analyst**

Doug    Harter -  Great. And then just in terms of capital return, you    mentioned sort of  the float. I  guess just how are you thinking about    kind of **how much of  the float  you'd be willing to take out and pacing around share  repurchase**?

Mat Ishbia -  Yes, Doug. So I'm learning these rules as we go **because at this stock  price, I'm a buyer, right**?    And so we'll buy shares as soon as tomorrow, I  think, as our legal    teams say we're allowed to do. And so I don't know  how many I can buy    and what I can do, but I'm very conscientious of the  float.  If the    float was not a concern, **we'd be more aggressive**. However,  **we     have authorization from the Board to buy up to $300 million, and I'm      going to take advantage of that opportunity while being  conscientious     of our partners in the float.**

TL/DR:     UWMC and their board have been looking at ways to give back to     shareholders. Instead of a short term cash out, they decided on a     buyback that they are planning to exercise immediately on so that they     can retire shares while the SP is low. They will NOT buy so much that   it   will ruin their float % for Russell. The CEO is aggressive, has    approval to spend $300 and he's going to take FULL advantage.  The CEO has stated he is a BUYER! They are  not   waiting, it's being deployed now.

Disclosure I am still in long position with 25K  at 8.39 USD shares of UWMC

# Just mopping up the hedgies and their short share bullshit.

CLNE's 8k filing was poorly timed, but realistically it had nothing to do with the rise in sentiment on reddit or anywhere else. The company choses to fund their infrastructure projects that way and the shareholders pay for it for a short time. This time, shareholders paid for it for a record short time (1 day).

I woke up this morning dejected. No, not because CLNE was low. I woke up dejected because my mom finished off my fruity pebbles last night and told me I couldn't buy anymore clover puts (thanks mom, by the way). It was bound to bounce back, and thanks to you diamond handed smooth brains it bounced back harder than before - and now I'm harder than ever.

The path forward is simple - buy share, hold shares. Circuit breakers will pop at each price level on the way up and shitadel and blackstone will eat shit for weeks. Tomorrow is going to be a beautiful day, and I'd love to hear what you think about it.

As a side note, there is something strangely sexual and weird about that gif posted above and I sincerely apologize for posting it.

42,GOEV,nvmz69,2021-06-09 06:16:01,GOEV a similar play to CLOV? Link to Citadel and other HFs,"So Citadel is a large institutional owner of CLOV with many calls (922000) and puts (429000) placed according to fintel, as well as 513,775 shares owned. My theory is they‚Äôre pumping CLOV to divert volume from AMC/GME and to offset maintenance cost on borrowed shorts/shares and keep maintenance margins up to avoid margin calls... but regardless, it‚Äôs still a nice ride to profit off. 

For those who missed most of CLOV, assuming it won‚Äôt continue skyrocketing at this pace, I see GOEV as an imminent rocket. At least one implicated hedge fund (sasquehanna with 1.16m shs) from GME/AMC ordeal is a large owner of GOEV. GOEV continues to be cheap buy, including option contracts. It‚Äôs where CLOV was at $10. BUT, it has actual baseline value and a history of being highly valued (>$24) - so ultimately a safer play as well.

However this is straight from the horses mouth from a Ford Dealership in Canada. They clearly state and clarify this partnership directly on their dealership website. Information I have just come across today.

[https://www.rivercityford.ca/xl-hybrids/](https://www.rivercityford.ca/xl-hybrids/)

What's more is in their latest today that have opened a new Centre in MI today again stating that it's where Ford and GM cars will become electrified.

I've been watching the level 2 for days and every time volume dries up it's being accumulating. In my opinion they are simply messing with the price.

If you want to read their investors presentation see below.

[https://xlfleet.com/assets/Uploads/PDF/Updated-Investor-Presentation-9.21.20.pdf](https://xlfleet.com/assets/Uploads/PDF/Updated-Investor-Presentation-9.21.20.pdf)

What a lot of people are missing about $XL is they have fingers in every sector of the EV market. 

They have substantial cash reserves of $400,000,000 roughly 1/3 of their market cap so there is no immediate requirement for cash.

XL recently bought WEES in a 50/50 cash and stock deal which again in my opinion is a great buy. World Energy generated $18 million in total revenue and was free cash flow positive for full year 2020. Its acquisition, which closed Monday, is expected to expand XL Fleet‚Äôs electric vehicle charging infrastructure capabilities, the company said

XL recently inked a deal with UBS arena to provide charging stations, solar generation and energy storage. For a total of 1,000 charging stations which is one of the largest deployments in the United States.

The company they inked the deal with also owns another 30 properties. Meaning more contracts is a very likely outcome.

They also announced that to cover their current clients who consist of names like Fedex, Coca Cola, Pepsi etc they would need to install over 100,000 charging stations making them the biggest player in the industry.

100's of millions sitting in cash

Finally a Short Float of 23.3% approx 22,000,000 shares short. For a comparison this is more than $AMC and $BB.

The market cap and share float are so small that the room for an explosive move is enormous.

#Hello shitheads and aspiring shitheads.  It is time to get into cow farts.  *(If you aren‚Äôt already. üòâ)*


I needed a new play to continue this meme high, and one stood out above the rest, mostly because it has something that gets me all hot and bothered but may frighten and baffle my fellow primates:  

A goddamn date.  *(I know, you‚Äôre not used to getting them.)*   
**>>>>June 18th<<<<**


There‚Äôs also shit involved, which is just a bonus.


#THE SHIT  
Clean Energy Fuels ($CLNE) specializes in renewable natural gas. Like all good RNG, renewable natural gas is about taking a bunch of random (and literal) bullshit and turning it into beautiful loot.  
In this case, they are grinding for methane. From all the üêÑüí®. It‚Äôs poot loot.


This is the most natural (ha!) step for the juggernaut initiative that is Green Energy which is coming nation-wide circa 2030 one way or another, even if the rest of the industry is still trying to work out an actual plan.  CLNE is ahead of the game. While üç¶üï∂üá∫üá∏ and co. are trying to decide how much of the country can actually run on all-electric, CLNE is securing deals with a little company called AMZN and securing some huge long term revenue.


#THE (GAMMA) SQUEEZE  
I can‚Äôt believe you made it all the way through that last section on only five emoji.  Good boy! Here‚Äôs some treats before I go on.  üçåüçåüçåüçåüçåüçåüçå


So what is special about this stock and why the date?  
Well, some rubes went and built a Goldberg machine out of options expiring on 6/18.  If this thing goes off, there will be so much gamma squeezed out that your new green dildo will make Bruce Banner feel inadequate.
  

CLNE has a float of 145 million and had been sitting, flatter than your wife‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äôs abs, at around $8 for the past month, consolidating and getting all pent up like you when the missus goes on her weeklong trips ‚Äúto the grocery store‚Äù.  
Prior to yesterday‚Äôs open, it had an open interest of 47,000 in 6/18 calls with strikes between $9 and $15.  
As of typing, that range now has 69,000 OI (nice!), 65,000 OTM, which means the squeeze potential has only increased with yesterday‚Äôs activity.
The most striking (HA!) of these numbers is the 29,000 calls aimed at a share price of $13.


Sure seems like someone knows or is planning something I don‚Äôt know about...  Either way, it is set to go off, like you when the missus...


Even before hitting that lucky number 13, calls representing 26 million shares, **18%** of the float and **500%** of the 10-day average volume prior to yesterday, should be hedged.  When it hits $13, 29 million more shares in calls become ITM and the volume beast will begin shitting out green dildos that it will consume to shit more in a shit ouroboros that will fuel the ape shit ship back to the moon.  üí©üöÄüí©üöÄüí©üöÄüí©üöÄüí©üöÄ  
Yesterday was just a preview of what will happen as more of those strikes are reached. The daily volume exceeded **600%** of the previous 10-day average and that resulted of a share price high of $9.74, **19%** higher than previous close. 

#THE PLAY  
Okay, fair warning, this part pains me to write a bit because it almost doesn‚Äôt seem like a bet, but the most safe method, and what will fuel the squeeze, is to buy and HODL shares.  You should know the drill by now. 


The reason shares won‚Äôt quite scratch the gambling itch is because CLNE‚Äôs ATH of $19 happened just back in February, and it hasn‚Äôt dipped far below its current level in five months. [It also has a price target of somewhere between $17 to $18, depending on the analyst.  ](https://finance.yahoo.com/research/stock-forecast/CLNE?symbols=CLNE&ncid=qsprelated_bl1fruji100)  
This means that even with its recent rise, there is not much downside, and the upside is huge even if the gamma squeeze does not play out.  The feeling of holding is not quite the same when there is no apparent risk of your bags being -50% for a quarter of a year before you can break even, I know, but hopefully you can find a way to adjust to all the green in your portfolio.


Shares also benefit from a possible raincheck of the scheduled event should 6/18 fail to deliver.  
While not quite as ideal, 9/17 calls have a whopping 20,881 open interest at the $20 strike which could grow into a similar situation should lower strike interest grow.  There is currently an OI of about 29,000 in the run up range from $10-$19 but it is not so nice and evenly distributed as it is on our magic date.  Worth watching though.

Overall, shares should securely keep your tits below you, if that is how you like them.


Options are where the biggest upside is going to be, and boy is there a lot of potential.  Thanks to CLNE‚Äôs month long power nap, premiums ~~are~~ were stupidly low for calls 6/18 strikes $13 and above.  A light breeze is all it took to make some of those ten baggers yesterday.  They still have plenty of room to run and premiums are still somewhat modest, all things considered.  Triggering the squeeze would send these to high heaven.

#TL;DR
Gamma squeeze. CLNE. 6/18.

&amp;#x200B;

Does this sound appealing to you? No. Well, that may be because you're not one of the brainless zombies scrolling through social media 16 hours a day. WISH targets ads towards this audience in hopes they will download the Wish app, once inside the app, they get access to your Facebook account to get key statistics about you. They then cater your product stream to you. It's a game at that point, for you to find the one thing that ISN'T trash on Wish's app, and get a huge discount.

For **107 million monthly users** this is a very fun and addicting game.

This ticker is currently **down 67%** of its IPO price in just about 6 months. Why?


It's all short-term negatives.

**1.) Negative user growth last quarter.** This is now starting to rebound with the country opening back up, because $WISH's biggest demographic is lower income individuals. Jobs are opening up again, expect a big rebound.

**2.) New business venture of providing logistics for its merchants.** Because of the new investment into this area, the margins for their logistical foray are slim. As this venture scales though, so will the margins. This is a big deal. Think how Amazon has their own delivery vehicles. It serves as a double positive. If you see a WISH van driving down the street that's free advertising while simultaneously providing logistical services.

**3.) Recent earnings was not stellar.** Take a look at the first 2 bullets again and you have your reasoning. Short term detriments.

&amp;#x200B;

So you mean to tell me because of very short term, consequential actions - WISH should be **down 67%** from IPO? You mean to tell me that an e-commerce stock should be trading a **1.6X forward sales** (growing at a rate of 20+% YoY), when the **average forward sales for an online retailer is trading at 4.5X???**

&amp;#x200B;

Wish should easily be double what it's currently valued at, based on sales alone.

**13.24** is key support now, keep an eye on that.

We have been coiling under key resistance for a few days (**14.53) THE SECOND THIS BREAKS, WE ARE CLEAR FOR TAKEOFF (AGAIN).** Also - note the way we are coiling upwards below key resistance is a very bullish data point. Volume is declining as we chop up.

Price targets are **17.25 & 20.36.**

This is the best setup I've seen in this stock since the initial squeeze. Remember, keep it simple.

Edit: Only thing I forgot to mention was the upper trendline of the wedge extends back to that 17.25 high - this is just another data point that adds to the validity of the breakout.

70,CLOV,nvnhz1,2021-06-09 06:47:51,Why CLOV hasn't squeezed yet and will soon! üöÄüåú,"According to the latest rounds of 13-F filings from CITADEL LLC, CITADEL has 724,599 shares of AMC and 514,775 shares of CLOV. This is nor surprising or a concern as CITADEL is such a large hedge fund that they have stake in MANY companies.

Recently, I have seen a lot of inaccurate information being spread that CLOV is a trap set out by the hedgefunds due to CITADEL stake in CLOV but this was just debunked as they have even a larger stake in AMC.

$CLOV

Data for CLOV from FINRA shows that on May 24, 2021, short interest was 36.11% of the float which is very high.  Data provided by ORTEX shows that short interest just this Friday was 42.58%. This  increased to 44.31% on Monday and yesterday's (Tuesday June 8) data was at 45.56% which is another INCREASE in the short interest. 

Even though the stock has sky rocketed in value, the SHORT INTEREST of the free float has NOT DECLINED meaning that a short squeeze has not occurred! Shorts currently are not covering their position. The recent gains in CLOV's stock price is purely from retail investors like us piling in.

If we continue to increase the share price of CLOV, then we will see a HUGE short squeeze and with the short interest of over 40%, that's going to be a very violent move and the return is going to be more that we can imagine! Considering the insane volume of 725 Million yesterday and the fact that it is the most mentioned ticker on WSB yesterday, there is definitely a lot of retail investors piling into CLOV to create a short squeeze.

If everything continues like this with the stock price increasing,  putting more pressure on the shorts, CLOV could ultimately squeeze at a much higher price!

Ok apes, chimps, gorillas, primates of all stripes... I'm going to level with you. I am posting this mainly because I want to throw one of my best ideas into the ring. But that's not the only reason I am writing this. I also want to inspire those of you who are just getting started in this game. For those who say that retail investors can't consistently make money in markets, I present you with some recent gain porn for your viewing pleasure. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gyvyzp0yln371.png?width=1355&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf56089ae7e9cff017cacdc546e9aa3c9e55f329

Look, I won't lie, making money investing is not easy -- lots of smart people are trying to do the same thing. But the real challenge is having the emotional resilience to stick with your thesis, and while not easy, if you stick to basic math and only invest in what you know, it is simple. 

As retail investors, we have a huge advantage over the big guys on Wall Street who need to hug the benchmarks, satisfy investor demands for quarterly results and invest only where they can expect to generate acceptable ""risk-adjusted"" returns where risk is bizarrely defined as ""volatility"", instead of permanent impairment of capital, which is how I see it. 

We can arbitrage these structural weaknesses in institutional portfolio management by making contrarian bets on stocks that are currently out of favor with the big guys, provided we've done our homework on the business and believe that it is undervalued. Eventually, if we are right about the trajectory of the business, they will eventually be forced to buy us out at a huge premium when the results prove out and herd mentality kicks back in the other way. 

I've made a nice chunk of coin on several positions over the last few years, which has enabled me to make bigger investments, and I am currently up materially on my latest portfolio positions. These are positions I have held for long time periods, with Bed Bath and Beyond being the largest position, the longest held and highest percentage gains. In my view, it also has the most upside, so I want to share a bit more with you about my thesis.

**Nothing I've said or am about to say should be construed in any way as investment advice.** **This is just me sharing my YOLO, with an explanation for my thesis.** 

Bed Bath and Beyond was a successful business when it first arrived on the scene, practically creating and defining the concept of Big Box Retail. As so often happens in life, their huge initial success bred complacency, and the co-founders (Warren Eisenberg and Leonard Feinstein) who continued presiding over the Board basically ran the company like it was their private piggy bank, without regard for small (or even large) shareholders. 

Under the leadership of Steven Temares, the CEO they handpicked, the business failed to innovate and keep up with basic changes taking place in retail -- such as the rise of e-commerce. BBBY began to see online giants like Amazon and even brick & mortar mass merchants like Target and Lowes begin to eat their lunch. Steven Temares, along with the rest of the c-suite, continued to receive huge salaries and bonuses, while the two co-founders received generous perks like personal black-car chauffer services, all paid for by the company -- and therefore, shareholders. 

They also refused to answer basic questions posited by Wall Street research analysts on earnings calls, seeing the investment community essentially as a nuisance to be tolerated but not proxies for the true owners of the business -- public investors. 

Well, the situation got so bad that finally, circa mid-2019 in the year of our chimp lord, a trifecta of activist investors led by Legion Partners (founder was trained by legendary activist Nelson Peltz) and John Duskin at Macellum Capital decided to wage war, buying up \~6% of the stock and filing a 170 white paper detailing all of the problems with how the company was being run and proposing to replace the entire Board of Directors and management team with its own slate of nominees. The presentation, which is phenomenal, is posted here:

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886158/000092189519001180/ex1dfan14a09050028_04262019.pdf

They went so far as to create a website for their campaign, [restorebedbath.com](https://restorebedbath.com/), which they eventually dismantled after reaching a cooperation and settlement agreement with the Board of Directors. This agreement effectively ceded control to the activists, who proceeded to replace everyone. It was a real Red Wedding style bloodbath... I mean total scorched earth policy... no respect for life. While it's never pleasant seeing people get canned, these people deserved it. After years and years of unaccountable shareholder abuse, someone finally came along and pulled out the game cartridge, blew on it and hit ""reset"" on the console. And they saw that it was good. 

In November 2019 they announced Mark Tritton, legendary Chief Merchandising Officer from Target who was the main person responsible for their massive success in developing private label / owned brand programs, would be taking the helm as CEO. Since taking charge, Mark has consistently been executing on the playbook laid out by the activists in their white paper, which basically calls for making low risk / high return changes to bring Bed Bath and Beyond up to modern retailing standards using well established best practices. 

While some would argue that a turnaround of this magnitude carries high execution risk, I would disagree at this time for several reasons: (1) The changes they have been making are actually quite well established strategies for modern retailing, with loads of case studies to pull from (Best Buy, Target, Lowes, etc); (2) they have the best team you could ask for implementing these changes (i.e., Mark Tritton and John Hartmann, who became COO of BBBY after a highly successful run as CEO of True Value hardware chains); (3) their compensation is heavily geared towards stock compensation, so **they only win if we all win;** and (4) most of the highest risk action plans, like divesting of non-core assets, culling unproductive / unprofitable stores, reducing bloated headcount and liquidating stale inventories at reasonable valuations, are all in the rear-view mirror. 

As of June 2021, Bed Bath and Beyond is at an inflection point with a strong focus on driving profitable growth from its core business lines. This comes down to a few very important strategies: (1) focusing on digital first, omni-always capabilities (leading with the website and mobile app but making sure they are able to serve customers however, whenever and wherever they want to shop -- think curbside pick-up, same-day delivery and buy-online pick-up in store aka BOPIS); (2) focusing on key destination categories where the company is seen as an authority in the home, driving preference for BBBY over other chains and even national brands by defining its key categories using data and developing owned brands to fill out their assortment in those areas (they have launched 6 so far this year, with another 4 expected by end of year -- ultimately they expect 30% of their sales to come from the brands they have created). This will help help them in multiple ways. First, the products are only going to be available at BBBY, so they are re-establishing their authority in the home and preference for BBBY as a brand and not just a venue to shop other manufacturers' products (this also means these items can't be bought online except for thru BBBY, so it is Amazon defense playbook 101). Second, these products have been strategically developed in areas where they had gaps in their assortment relative to the competitors they were losing share to. As mentioned above, development of these brands was informed by **data**, including detailed line reviews and purchasing data. Third, and final, these products are designed to cost and have very healthy margins that should improve the overall margin profile of the business as they are rolled out. This fireside chat with Mark Tritton from January 2021 explains it all far better than I can, and is well worth watching for curious apes: 

[https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/videos/a-fireside-chat-with-mark-tritton-president-and-ceo-of-bed-bath-and-beyond/](https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/videos/a-fireside-chat-with-mark-tritton-president-and-ceo-of-bed-bath-and-beyond/)

**So where does this all leave us today?**

The company has successfully implemented its digital first, omni-always capabilities, rolling out BOPIS, curbside pickup and same-day delivery (just signed up deals with Instacart & Doordash). Digital sales were up 86% in the most recent quarter and 99% in the Bed Bath banner (they also own Buy Buy Baby, which is the largest national baby retail chain in the US with the bankruptcy of Babies R US -- this alone makes BBBY an interesting investment with tons of hidden value).

For the first time in **years**, the company began posting positive same-store sales for the last 3 quarters under Mark Tritton (consistently comping up in the mid-single digits). This is a very positive sign of the changes taking place already. Same-store sales metrics are probably the most important data point for retailers, as it basically tells you if consumers think they have a good reason to exist. Quite frankly, it is an extraordinary achievement by Mark and his team that after years of declining same-store sales they are now positive for 3 consecutive quarters, and I don't think this has gotten enough attention.

They have also begun launching their new owned brands, with 6 already launched and another 4 or so on the way this year. These brands have a strong focus on their top 5 destination categories (bedding, bath, kitchen & food prep, indoor decor, and organization) -- I've personally purchased and used these products, and they are excellent quality at reasonable price points. I think they will do great.

They are repurchasing $1bn of their own stock (at least $375mm completed so far at an average price of \~$23 per share, reducing their share count from \~126mm to \~109mm.

Normalizing their revenues for divested brands and culling of unprofitable / lowest productivity stores in their footprint, management has guided to \~$8.2bn of sales and $525mm of EBITDA **this year,** with sales comping up in the low- to mid-single digits range for the next several years and EBITDA margins improving to high single digits / low double digits resulting in EBITDA of $850mm-$1bn by YE 2023.

Applying simple mathematics and established standards of value, I believe the evidence shows that businesses in this industry (big box and specialty retail) would typically be valued at \~8-12x EBITDA which would imply an enterprise value (value of the whole business, not just the equity) of \~$9bn at the midpoint, which seems eminently reasonable for an iconic retailer under solid leadership with about 1000 stores and authority in key growing segments of the US economy.

Since they have virtually the same amount of cash as debt, the enterprise value should be about the same as the equity value, so \~$9bn at the midpoint above. With \~109mm shares outstanding today, that puts implied equity value per share at \~$82, but where it gets even more interesting is if you factor in the share buybacks. They've still got $625mm of remaining authorized share repurchases under their existing program, and depending on how cheap they are able to buy those shares they could materially reduce the share count further.

**So why are the big institutional investors continuing to ignore this stock? Why does everyone continue to ignore the insanely cheap valuation and upside potential under the extraordinary new leadership of Mark Tritton, John Hartmann and the rest of the new team?** 

I can think of several possibilities, but probably the main one is a backward looking bias, because the memory of the old management team and their awful performance dies hard. Their prolonged period of value destruction also gave rise to a narrative, parroted widely by thematic investors and talking heads on CNBC, basically a nonsense theory that all brick & mortar would die and the consumer would only ever want to shop at Amazon (somehow ignoring blatantly contradictory evidence provided by Target, Lowes, Walmart, etc). 

In this excellent interview with burgeoning hedge fund manager Dan McMurtrie (aka Supermugatu), he discusses the reality of how Amazon is killing bad retail, not all retail, and how certain investors / the media have taken the the idea way too far as they so often love to do. **I cannot recommend this highly enough -- well worth watching beginning at 39:45.**

It might take some time for BBBY to shake off the worries created during the former management team's tenure. Most of the time, the stock market is forward looking, but in this case investors have adopted a thesis that has them psychologically stuck in the past due to PTSD, and the distractions in rear-view mirror are blinding them to what is likely to happen in the next 6, 12, 18 months. 

Eventually, I personally expect BBBY to shock the market with positive results one of these quarters, forcing a rapid, seemingly unexpected valuation revision in the stock. They have already begun to put up excellent numbers, if you look at the underlying same-store sales, digital growth, growth in top 5 destination categories, for example. However, there has still been a lot of noise in the numbers from divestitures, culling of store footprint, COVID impact in 2020, etc., and it appears that perception has not caught up yet with the new reality.

While I haven't focused on it much here, the company also has an excellent balance sheet with over $1bn of cash, no meaningful near-term debt maturities, solidly positive free cash flow generation & very high short interest.

Even with all of the prevailing negative sentiment, this has been a profitable investment for me so far (I purchased heavily in periods where others abandoned hope over the last few years). In my opinion, the company is probably worth about $80 / share as of today, however with continued solid execution and more enthusiasm coming back into the name, I could see this valued well into the triple digits. 

So, even with my sizeable gains I haven't sold one share and don't plan to anytime soon. I am holding this baby to the end.",DD,0.72

EX dividend is literally 6/9 do you need to know anything else? This was made for WSB.

EDIT: I guess I have to do some real DD so automod doesn't ban me. Nobody reads that shit anyways.

Reasons this fucker is going to the moon:

1. They are the top mortgage lender... If you listened to their earnings call it was much different than RKT's. While RKT saw margins damper and guided down for the future, UWMC actually had a completely different tone. Margins were practically unaffected and they probably couldn't have given better guidance. TLDR: Rates go up we dominate competition and market share. Rates stay at these levels we continue to have massive revenues and return that money to the shareholders.
2. Next reason, they actually return money to shareholders! First year on the market and they already pay a dividend and have a massive share repurchase program in the works.
3. Now onto that share buyback program. They announced $300m of share repurchases.... for context when they announced that the entire float was worth $600m... you can see how this might affect price.
4. This company is making nearly 900m a quarter of NET INCOME and is priced at $12b... Show me where else you can find this in this market.
5. As you've already heard a million times by others Wall St is shorting the shit out of this thing for no apparent reason and you best believe they are doubling down after that run up and the recent fed comments on decreased house sales.

TLDR. UWMC going to the moon.... Way over shorted way under priced worst case scenario you are holding something that pays you every quarter and has a track record that lasts decades.

So I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**

1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.
2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. 

I decided to do some research into the questions: ""how much inflation are we really experiencing?"" and ""is it out of line with historical inflation"" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.

Since this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.

So...

# What is the actual Inflation Rate? 

Based on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).

[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)

**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**

To question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.

To question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.

**What about inflation in Housing?**

Good question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  

[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)

That's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.

[A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/u1p8k5w2vyz61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313b90056ba27d95c63cbff50b7e0142d84b327)

I also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. 

# How did you come up with these numbers?

I decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).

[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)

To construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.

 I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. 

**Last thing I'll note:**

If you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win.

^(Disclaimer: This is not financial advice, this is my opinion, do your own DD. Unlike my last post, this one will not mention ass to mouth, sorry. It took me three hours to write this because my mom would only release one of my arms from my chair restraints for fear of me buying more CLOV puts. As far as ASO goes..... I like the stock.)

Hello again WSB apes, cows, and palan-tards,

A lot of you have probably never heard of ASO (Academy Sports) because we all know you never leave the carboard castle your mom helped you build in the basement where you ""day trade"" (read: buy high sell low duh idiot). 

Academy Sports deals in all things outdoors. Guns, ammo, team sports stuff (no, larping in the park downtown doesn't count), apparel, shoes, etc... Notice I didn't say anything about video games, free popcorn, or leprechauns. We're talking about a whole different animal here. Academy is located mainly in the Southern United States and operates 250+ stores. In the year 2000 (ancient history for some of you autistic fucks) they had 35 stores. 

# ASO went public via IPO in October of 2020 at a price of $12 or some shit. Let's take a look at what it's done since then, starting with the first 6 months of it's life:

**WARNING: This next section contains some really retarded Travelcenters of America type of shit. Look at these extremely simplified charts may cause wrinkles, but is more likely to further smooth your brain; you're welcome.**

https://preview.redd.it/4iic0sbxi2471.png?width=1945&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f0f7188de3b4d176262467f811ecba409ae3c68

As you can see (or maybe you can't because it's so fucking small) ASO doubled  üöÄ in its first 6 months on the market. For you really smooth brains, that's about $12 or 100% of upward movement. Now let's take a look at the 2 months since then...

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dcadus2fj2471.png?width=2007&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb5ec12a9880920a4fafda29f931e3e1fd7b792a

Notice the slope of the line changed drastically. The earnings call in late March/early April was the kick in the ASO this thing needed. People started to realize this thing was undervalued and making fuck tons of money. 

# Today, ASO had their next earnings call. How'd it go?

First of all, I fucking hate premarket earnings calls. It's already hard enough to get out of bed with the thought of living in a world where people actually invest in PLTR. Moving on to the earnings; in short, they fucking killed it again and bigger than last time:

* Adjusted income of $182.5 million vs Q1 2020 $400,000 income **(profitability)**
* EPS of $1.89 (estimate was $0.90, 100%+ beat) vs Q1 2020 $0.01 **(shareholder value)**
* Revenues up 40% year over year to $1.6 billion vs already optimistic estimate of $1.5 billion **(sales)**
* Upped their 2021 guidance to $4.50 EPS (I think it was $3.90 or $4 or something who cares)

ASO is currently trading at a P/E ratio of about 9. The US industry average for specialty retail is about 15, representing a 50%+ upside based on P/E alone and not considering the fact that it's growing like your weird aunt's face boil (that thing's a tumor and you can't convince me otherwise)

# ""I see the lines and all the dildos, but what do I do?"" A fair question, fellow retard. I have no fucking clue...

Somehow today, and as has been tradition for the last 6 weeks or so, the stock price dropped some after killer earnings, allowing for a beautiful entry point. 

I like the stock. I like the trend. I like the business. You can deduce my July 16th positions by looking at the second screenshot if you're less than 96.7% retarded. This thing barely ever touches that the blue line on those charts because it's still undervalued. I thought the trend would slow and the growth would slow, but it hasn't yet and it only keeps getting better and better data to support the pattern.

This isn't a squeeze. No gamma, short, titty, or otherwise. This is a less direct path to the moon and mars than rolling the dice with your net worth on retarded FD moves. This is a solid play for your portfolios to hedge against your absolutely mind blowing decision making process, or lack thereof.

The FED only has two options at the moment:

Raise rates to curb current inflation. This would cause the treasury to raise its coupon rates (bond interest), which would mean lower bond prices. This means the government has to pay higher interest, ultimately leaving the treasury no other option than defaulting on its obligations.

2. The FED doesnt raise rates, and lets inflation (and later hyperinflation) eat away at the dollar. This would also make the bonds worth less, as theyd have to lower the price to compensate for the interest being worth nothing. In this situation, the fed would be the only one willing to hold government bonds which would worsen the inflation as they effectively dont get payed interest on it.

Option one, the government goes bankrupt due to interests being to high to pay back. Option two, the public goes bankrupt due to hyperinflation.

Either way, a short position would profit in this trade.

\*\*\* If you aren't in TSM ( ***Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing***) you hate money. Here are some reasons you should look into this stock and buy it before it is too late. \*\*\*

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Economics 101, Supply and Demand.**

* TSM is the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the world
* THERE IS A WORLDWIDE SEMICONDUCTOR SHORTAGE
* Let me emphasize this point. THERE IS A WORLDWIDE SEMICONDUCTOR SHORTAGE

As many of you know, there is a worldwide semiconductor shortage (yes I said it again). These semiconductors are vital components in every electronic we use today. Without these semiconductors, things like smartphones, automobiles, video game consoles, etc. Would not be able to function.

(Read the following if you want to see why these semiconductors are so vital...or just completely trust me, that's fine too)

***\*ALL COMPUTERS NEEDS SEMICONDUCTORS TO FUNCTION\****

Semiconductors are used primarily in electronic devices, including chips, diodes, transistors, and integrated circuits. According to Goldman Sachs 169 industries rely on semiconductors. Anything that is computerized or uses radio waves depends on semiconductors. Your phone is a computer, your car is a computer, your video game consoles are computers, your amazon firestick is a computer, every aspect of your life is dependent on these semiconductors.

TSM PRODUCES THESE CHIPS FOR THE FOLLWOING COMPANIES AND MANY MORE:
-Apple
-Toyota
-NVIDIA
-AMD
-SO MANY MORE

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do you believe the future of automobiles are powered by electric? Not without semiconductors.

**Semiconductors in Automobiles**

1. **Vehicle electrification ‚Äì** Semiconductors have made it possible to replace manual systems with electrical systems. Electrification of key systems provides benefits such as increased vehicle efficiency, reductions in carbon emissions, and minimizing oil dependency.
2. **Safety and driver assistance ‚Äì** The increasing need for better safety and driver assistance systems in cars has provided a niche for semiconductors. Intelligent functions such as backup cameras, blind-spot detection, adaptive cruise control, lane change assist, airbag deployment, and emergency braking systems are all made possible through the integration of semiconductor technologies.
3. **Connectivity ‚Äì** Cars are increasingly incorporating technology that improves their connectivity. New vehicles on the market include ever-more sophisticated telematics (long-distance data transmission) and infotainment capabilities which feed drivers information on factors such as road closures, collision avoidance, and even free parking spaces at their destination. On-board computers which handle this information have to process millions of lines of code every second. Semiconductors allow cars to stay connected in real-time.

Semiconductors are key to the future of the electric vehicle (EV) industry as they help to control the powertrain and battery. Semiconductors are also used in the variety of touchscreens that are installed in the driver‚Äôs dash and in the back of passenger seats.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**FINANCIALS/NEWS**

* Financially, the company has reported its third straight quarter of record sales in its first-quarter earnings report back in April.
* Its revenue came in 25.4% higher year-over-year to 12.9 billion.
* The stock has more than doubled in price over the past year
* Japan‚Äôs government recently announced that it wants TSM and Sony to invest $9.2 billion to build the country‚Äôs first 20-nanometer chip plant.
* Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) said on Friday (5/21/2021) that it has increased its 2021 output for a key component for automotive semiconductors by 60% compared with last year, amid a global chip shortage.

These are just a couple of things. If This has caught your eye please research TSM on your own and you can find more great news and financial statements...or don't, you've made it this far, might as well go all in.

98,TLRY,nviv33,2021-06-09 02:27:18,TLRY Potential- Update #2,"Due to popular demand, I want to update everybody with a part 2 following my initial TLRY post.

&#x200B;

Since my last post, we have seen good signs for Tilray- consistently green days. I have been tracking the technical indicators and it appears longs are heavily favored for a trade in the short term. See the technicals below:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g8whk7h8t4471.png?width=1384&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a42992564dc578d79f67261fa2a343ef330e10b

&#x200B;

This is a daily technical analysis which favors 9 bullish technical indicators to 1 bearish indicator.

In addition, you can see 11:1 favorability on the daily moving averages.

&#x200B;

Things get interesting because the volume is gradually increasing with the combination of the share price increasing.

&#x200B;

Using Fibonacci retracement + other technical indicators I believe a break of  23.49 resistance could lead to a big daily rally.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Comparatively, we saw some big rallies in popular reddit names today- specifically CLOV.

[CLOV had a SI ratio of 0.99 before the takeoff + a short volume ratio of 0.5 a day before the big move](https://preview.redd.it/e19ashksu4471.png?width=1258&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9903821f22c8cf3e3cf28d48aad3b959fed3d13)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[TLRY currently has an SI ratio of 1.86 and short vol ratios ranging from 0.15-0.55](https://preview.redd.it/1kk7h8e0v4471.png?width=1340&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6e10f931e13e4a1fe187b87965494d041496810)

&#x200B;

TLRYs SI is moderately higher than CLOV- the share price keeps increasing in addition to volume. The question really is, how long can TLRY stay green and maintain momentum? At this point it's not a matter of if shorts cover, but WHEN will shorts cover? This high short interest is unjustified as Tilray has announced very bullish fundamental news including: new product line, recent reverse merger with Aphria, and strong regulatory statements on medical cannabis. My price target for the short term is: $120.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I believe the key here is consistent volume + eating up the ask for a big win for WSB. All my buddies out there who bought at 70, we are coming back for you! :)

In accordance with Russell US ground rules, the reconstitution of the Russell US Indexes will take place after the market close on 25 June 2021. Performed annually, reconstitution ensures that the Russell US indexes continue to accurately reflect the current state of the US equity market and its market segments, including market capitalization (e.g., large and small cap), sector breakdowns, and style structure.

&#x200B;

# Timetable:

**Friday 07 May 2021:** Rank day. Russell US Index membership eligibility for the 2021 reconstitution is determined from published information and market capitalizations at market close.

&#x200B;

**Friday 04 June 2021:** Preliminary membership lists are published after market close. **This is the catalyst.**

&#x200B;

**Friday 21 May to Friday 11 June 2021:** Query period. Users are welcome to query the published data; any corrections will be communicated after market close each day. Merger and spin-off companies will be re-ranked when the transaction is effective between the rank day and the index lock-down. No further re-ranking will occur after.

&#x200B;

**Friday 11 June 2021. Monday 14 June 2021:** **Lock-down.** No further corrections will be implemented\* and the Russell US index reconstitution can be considered final (with any further changes to shares and free float isolated to changes associated with corporate events).

&#x200B;

**Friday 25 June 2021:** The Russell US reconstitution is implemented after market close.

The assumption being made here is that the stock market will react to AMC, BB, and ASO short squeezes EXACTLY as it did to GME. A true apples to apples comparison of what has happened to GME being applied to our other favorites.

Up first is teaching you how to calculate earning in the form of a percentage. The formula goes like this. (Current Value - initial Cost)√∑initial cost x 100= percentage return. 

GmE started at roughly 18$ before it gained squeeze worthy traction and eventually topped out at $483. I chose 18$ as the starting point t because earning up until that point were smooth and slowly trending upwards on a 1 year chart. GmE has 70 Million Shares outstanding. It's 18 to 483 dollars increase gives it a return of 2,583% roughly.

Applying this to AMC goes like this. AMC had a ""pre-surge"" stable price of 10$. 10x25.83=258$ however GME only has 15 percent of the shares outstanding that AMC has so you have to consider the market Cap. $258x.15%= $38.70 expected squeeze price. All variables being the same at its highest AMC could go to $38.70 

BB is going  to be very similar to AMC because of a large market cap. BB ""pre-surge"" stable price is $10 as well, this is being generous because a good argument could be made to use $8-9 but I decided to use 10. So 10x25.83=$258 however GME only has 12% of shares outstanding as BB so that has to be factored in 258x .12%= $30.96  I believe at the height of any BB squeeze due to market cap the price could soar as high as $30 using GME variables.

Here is where things get interesting ASO has a ""pre-surge"" stable price of $30 and GME has 77% of shares outstanding compared to ASO, a Much higher variable, with a much higher starting price, and a higher short interest than BB & AMC. Here we go 30x25.83= 775$ 
775 x.77= $596 squeeze price potential

So in essence we can triple our money or better on AMC & BB depending on when you bought in. AsO has the potential to be HUUUGGEüöÄüöÄüíØüòÉ",DD,0.78

110,CLOV,nw6lmm,2021-06-09 23:16:51,A quick DD on CLOV borrowing fee,"Since I saw a lot of misinformed comments in the daily threads, I figured I would share this information.

The current borrow fee rate for CLOV is 116.7% (https://iborrowdesk.com/report/clov). The borrow fee rate is not the short interest; that is the number of shares shorted. 

The borrow fee rate is the amount it costs per year to short a share, as shorting requires borrowing. To put it into perspective, for a costant price, a yearly borrow fee rate of 116.7% would imply a daily cost of paying 0.3197% of the value of the shorted share.

0.32% in the world of returns is a lot. 

Yesterday, the short interest rate on CLOV was 43.54% (https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1402368431291314177?s=20). This number might be lower now, as the borrowing fee rate depends on other factors (volatility, ease of locating shares) than just the supply available; shorts may have covered a bit. It will, however, not be a lot lower. What this implies is that for some 30%-50% of the number of shares available on CLOV, the shorts are paying 0.32% of the price of the share just for holding the position, every. single. day. 

The shorts are absolutely bleeding buckets. In fact, this situation, including the drop today, is incredibly similar to GME; I dare say even more so than AMC. Another great buy, support each other please.

I currently hold multiple call options comprising 19% of my portfolio, and that's only because GME takes up 60%.

Obligatory rocket emojis üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Edit: Since I made this thread I received a lot of good, confirming information, which I would like to summarize here:

- The short interest rate is currently at 50.42% according to Ortex.

- https://fintel.io/shortSqueeze model states CLOV is currently most likely to squeeze.

- questrade Canada also has a borrow fee of 59%.

- Additionally https://www.shortsight.com/ shows that CLOV has a bullish sentiment with a low share availability score of 4, meaning shares are confirmed really limited across the board. This means multiple brokerages are confirmed to have a hard time locating shares. That is huge. Remember what caused GME to not be allowed to be bought anymore? Borrowing fee rates were high for a ton of brokers, and some, including IBKR and Robinhood, had these high borrowing rates in place because they were running out of shares to locate. They could no longer provide the shares they are obligated to provide to those who either want to short or buy the share. And hence they shut both down, as otherwise the brokerages themselves would trigger an insane and instant shortsqueeze. An incredible indicator.

Academy Sports and Outdoors (ASOüöÄüöÄüöÄ)  is a brick and mortar Sporting Goods and Outdoor retailer that is CRIMINALLY Undervalued right now. They have a Strong Buy Rating on Yahoo Finance with an Estimated 100% return on tendies. Additionally they have a Strong Buy Rating from Zach's.  I believe their upcoming earnings 6/8 will be monumental and they should be delivering a brinks truck to your driveway...

**Recent Events**

ASO just recently paid down over 99Million Dollars in debt. This will save them an estimated per year 9Million on interest alone. In Addition the S&P Global has increased their credit rating to a B+ from originally a B.  Academy has been trimming the fat and becoming more lean in the retail space--setting themselves up to deleverage debt and enhance growth opportunities.

Currently they are trading at a P/E Ratio of 10.72, this represents a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 14.98. 

**Competitors**

Dicks is one of ASO's largest competitors. During their earnings report they announced a crushing of earnings, this is resulting from primarily their ecommerce, in store purchases opening up and yes you guessed it, GUNS. Their share price after earnings announcement jumped from roughly $84 to $98. I see ASO moving in a similar pattern, expecting to CRUSH earnings with ammo, guns, retail, and ecommerce trading. With the pandemic in the rearview, anecdotally I was in there this past weekend, and grills, outdoor gear, and other items were flying off the shelves.

**Short Squeeze? (jk)**

One thing that is interesting is according to Yahoo Finance the Short % of Float is 26.06% with 93% of Shares held by institutions. (Melvin?)

**TLDR**

Academy Sports and Outdoors (ASO) is undervalued in terms of fundamentals, I believe this next week's earnings report lead to all signs of them crushing it, which will in turn make Apes rich and those shorts eat shite.

Disclaimer: this is not financial advice.

I‚Äôm big on studying trends and I believe I have found a 2-3 bagger for you retards. I‚Äôve been following $RIDE for about 2 months now, and I noticed the potential for a short squeeze beginning to form last week. I‚Äôve noticed the propensity to squeeze comes from the following criteria:

* Short % of float must be over 20% ([over 28% of $RIDE‚Äôs float is short](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ride); probably closer to 30-32% since it was last updated)
* Small/Mid Cap stocks with considerable growth prospects ($RIDE has a $1.6B market cap) in a hyper-growth EV industry
* Heavily controversial stock, meaning some say it is way overvalued, some say it is undervalued

These stocks tend to be the most volatile. The charts are often comical to even look at (feel free to check out $RIDE‚Äôs 6-month chart for reference).

**$MVIS comparison:**

Taking a look at $MVIS, I noticed that Hindenburg research targeted them in a short & distort attack a few months ago.

I actually googled ‚ÄúHindenburg MVIS‚Äù and the second article that popped up was titled ‚ÄúTechnically Incompetent Short Seller Hindenburg Makes False Statements About MicroVision.‚Äù This bodes very poorly for Hindenburg, as they seem to have started to formulate a lot of their claims out of thin air.

More recently, Hindenburg targeted $RIDE with the same tactics. They called out $RIDE‚Äôs pre-orders for their trucks, while almost all EV companies are utilizing pre-orders, this[ has been clear ever since $RIDE went public](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/16/2127140/0/en/Lordstown-Motors-Releases-Business-Updates-Remains-on-Track-to-Begin-Production-of-the-Lordstown-Endurance-in-September-2021.html) last year.

I found a good[ rebuttal post for Hindenburg‚Äôs attack on $RIDE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkt7qi/the_bullcase_for_lordstown_motors_corporation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on this sub from not too long ago as well.

**$RIDE Intro:**

Lordstown Motors ($RIDE) is currently developing their [full-size all electric Endurance truck](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/endurance). They have an[ experienced management team](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/corporate-governance/management) with multiple execs from companies like Tesla, Volkswagen, GM, Honda, etc; also, GM‚Äôs investment in exchange for their [massive 6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/) helped them hit the ground running. They are targeting commercial fleets and government contracts with their truck initially. Their trucks will be $45,000 after tax credits and get a 75mpg equivalent. They also will require very little maintenance as they utilize true 4 wheel drive with hub motors in each wheel.

Discussing their[ full-year 2020 results](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020) on March 17th, $RIDE management confirmed that ‚ÄúTimeline to Start of Production (SoP) in September 2021 remains on track, with beta prototype build underway and the first beta vehicles to be ready by the end of March; vehicles to be sent for durability, crash, validation, and lighting testing with various partners and to early initial customers for feedback.‚Äù

They have[ shown their betas to the public](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1377350607518920705?s=20) as well.

**Ohio‚Äôs Endorsement of LMC:** üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ

[U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), a Democrat who represents the Youngstown, OH area and is running for the senate currently, didn‚Äôt mince words about the (Hindenburg) short-seller report. He called it ‚Äú‚Äòbull\*\*\*\*. I mean it was just to me, it seemed like a hatchet job for (short-sellers) to make money,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd look, I mean (Lordstown) is threatening the status quo. And a lot of people are going to bet against them, figuratively and literally. It comes with the territory. You don‚Äôt get to the top of the mountain without a bunch of people trying to drag you down.‚Äù

[Secretary of State Frank LaRose](https://www.vindy.com/news/local-news/2021/03/ceo-extols-positives-of-lordstown-motors-on-heels-of-critical-report/): ‚ÄúI think what this is, is an opportunity to take a challenging circumstance from just a few years ago and turn it into a truly unique and amazing opportunity for not right here in the Youngstown area ‚Äî Voltage Valley as we like to call it ‚Äî but all over Ohio.‚Äù

[Ohio Governor Mike Dewine:](https://www.cleveland.com/open/2020/06/gov-mike-dewine-said-he-expects-success-from-lordstown-plant-in-first-normal-press-conference-during-pandemic.html) ‚ÄúReally, this is the future,‚Äù DeWine said of the truck and the facility, where he got a private tour. ‚ÄúI think this truck has a great competitive advantage over its competitors.‚Äù

[Senator Michael Rulli](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), the Republican state senator from the area, has introduced several bills in Ohio aimed at helping the electric-vehicle industry, said he‚Äôs visited the (Lordstown) plant recently. He said he‚Äôs seen the company‚Äôs robotic assembly line putting together a series of 57 betas. Based on what he‚Äôs seen, Rulli said he thinks Lordstown Motors will be producing thousands of Endurance trucks sometime this year or perhaps early next year. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre way way way far along,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhoever wrote that article (Hindenburg) has never been in that (Lordstown) plant. That is a fact. Anyone who was in that plant would read that article and think it was garbage.‚Äù

**I WILL NOW SCREAM IT FOR ALL OF YOU: ALL OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TO $RIDE‚ÄôS**[ **MASSIVE 6.2 MILLION SQUARE FOOT FACILITY**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/lordstown-motors-races-to-revive-shuttered-ohio-gm-plant.html)**. $RIDE IS LEGIT AND WILL BE PRODUCING ELECTRIC PICK-UP TRUCKS FOR COMMERCIAL FLEET CUSTOMERS IN JUST 4 MONTHS.**

They also [recently announced ‚ÄúLordstown Week‚Äù](https://businessjournaldaily.com/lordstown-motors-stock-climbs-14-on-lordstown-week-announcement/) in mid June for analysts, customers, partners, and investors to attend. This will silence all of the short-sellers, lawsuits, and FUD.

$RIDE has an earnings call tomorrow 5/24 where they will be giving updates on crash testing. If they announce they are still on track for mass production in September, this will be HUGE.

**$RIDE Upcoming Catalysts include:**

* [Earnings call tomorrow 5/24](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-announces-timing-first-quarter-2021-financial) to discuss updates on crash testing and timeline to production.
* [Department of energy Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (ATVM) loan](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759546/000110465921037690/tm2110022d1_ex99-1.htm), which should be announced by the end of Q2 2021 (literally any day now).
* [Release of ERV in conjunction with Camping World](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2021/01/lordstown-motors-to-reveal-electric-commercial-van-this-summer/), which is expected next month, and the[ Camping World CEO has already leaked a sneak peak](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1379433681995984905?s=20) of it.
* Beta production updates and contracts with commercial fleets.

**Summary:**

$MVIS moved from $10 to $27 in just a couple of days, and I believe $RIDE is about to make a similar move from $10 back to $20+ with their earnings call being tomorrow after-hours.

EVs are front and center, and the government is pushing for the adoption of EVs in such a big way that you‚Äôd be a fool not to own a piece of the pie.

$RIDE has one of the lowest market caps out of all of the EV plays, and they are the closest to fully automated mass production (this September).

Position: 5 Jan 2023 calls w/ a $40 strike. I‚Äôm planning to buy more tomorrow before earnings.

**TL;DR:**

$RIDE stock has incredibly high upside, and I think it‚Äôs only a matter of time until it squeezes back up to the $20‚Äôs. I have been following the chart for a while now, and I believe institutions are currently loading up before this gets squeezed back up.

Remember what happened the last time a stock had borrow rates this high? Everyone seems to be bashing CLOV as a distraction from other stocks but to me it looks like after the price spike yesterday the shorts have doubled down on their position.

Since CLOV reached its ATH from the activity yesterday new short positions had to be opened in order for hedge funds to prevent further losses. The shorts are already under a lot of pressure as the share price is higher than any of their previous short positions unlike all of the ""tHE neXt BiG sQwEEz"" plays you retards have been posting for the last 24 hours.

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

&nbsp;

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back.

This is a boomer-esque company with mega potential to squeeze AND these motherfuckers GIVE you money to buy their shares ($0.10 per share per quarter). At current share prices, that‚Äôs around 4% a year, which is MORE than the average mortgage interest rate right now. 

It‚Äôs being shorted because it went public with a spac, but the company has been around since the 80s.

Also there is a short interest of 20.5% of the float. Think about this:
- shorts have to PAY to hold their position
- holders get PAID to hold their position

Gamma squeeze potential:
- 100K open interest on 6/18 $10c
- translates to the buying of 10M shares if the stock closes above $10
- That translates to a pure BUY VOLUME double the average daily volume in one afternoon 

You‚Äôd have to be retarded not to buy this now.

Great setup but keeps getting dragged under the breakout

Volume increasing steadily - uptrend is still intact

There aren't a lot of great levels to play off of right here - so **look for a candle close** (1h, 2h, 1D - up to you, each is a better signal than the one before) **above 11.47 to enter** and use that as support

Some resistance at **12.11**, but should target **14.12** at least - above there **15.72, 17.31**

\---

Don't know where all the hype for this stock went - but it has a nice setup so I thought I'd share.

[$CLNE 1Y 1D](https://preview.redd.it/knx94mwsw3471.png?width=2224&format=png&auto=webp&s=817708ac80814cefd26c55bda41979bb0969aa4e)

It's a large falling wedge going back to February. It has tried to break out 3 times in the past 3 trading days and keeps failing. There **aren't a lot of levels near the breakout point** \- which is a major thing I look for. You need support to play off of on the long side - and confluence generates better signals. This is probably why it keeps dropping back in.

However - volume is steadily increasing in an uptrend  (positions are changing hands) - and I've noticed a trend of tickers flooding the front page --> seemingly being forgotten about --> pumping 200% a week later - so **I'm keeping a close eye on this one.**

The nearest level - and a great one at that - above the breakout point is at **11.47 -** it will be resistance at first but once we clear it, great support. I'm looking for an hourly candle close above to enter - and I'll add more on a 2 hour close, followed by a 1 day close. Options chain is actually pretty solid so looking at Julys.

Targets/resistances above are **12.11, 14.12, 15.72, 17.31 -** each should become support after we close above it.

Luckily BB comes to help -options volume and rising 20- 22 strike prices cost imply some volatility in the upcoming days and weeks but as many ape bag holders need 20+ price to break even -paper hands would be less and next temptation could come in at 30-40..70+ or maybe moon itself?
If I knew what to do -I would have done it, so obviously no financial advice here but I'd like BB at 40+ by 11 June.

After Friday's action, the conclusion is no, but let's look at the chart and see what's going on.

What happened on Friday:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x2wmukqxbp371.png?width=1916&format=png&auto=webp&s=01459ffc0e98d47ef446f563fcf853f0fff36af1

The first real red day in 2 weeks lost support at the $14.50 USD mark but also had reduced volume. Can't win them all. We should consider this pullback extremely healthy and does not interfere with the overall bull trend as we were exceeding the Bollinger bands for 5 straight trading days. Exceeding the Bollinger bands is considered to be a strong indicator of volatility, and I strongly believe we have more volatility to come. I would also assume traders were taking their anywhere from 60%-100% profits off the table.

We did not bounce back up to the $24-$33 range as I expected on Friday, but again opinions are like assholes. Everyone has one. I believe that range is easily accessible still through this coming trading week.

Signs that make me bearish:  
\-1D chart RSI is still quite high but is reaching back into a healthy range.  
\-Lower volume Friday. But the overall market was low and red so I'm not too concerned.  
\-Gap to be filled on the chart. \~$11.56-12.30. Usually, gaps do get filled on charts but not always in the short term.  
\-Loss of the 14.50 support. On the hourly chart we had a small bounce in that range on Thursday after the massive opening and slightly recovered, a bounce again just after open on Friday but ultimately failed for the rest of the day. This is a volume issue and many taking profits/losses trying to swing trade.  
\-Possibility of reaching $12.10, if that fails next stop is probably \~$11.30

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nvjhe4fybp371.png?width=1811&format=png&auto=webp&s=817de62d8aedc2eacb1a9bcbbb5e3ac73bf1a80e

These are the bearish signals that I can find and are important to note but again the overall bull trend still exists on a daily, and when in doubt zoom out is the motto. One bad day does not mean you have a bad life.

Signs that make me bullish:  
\-We ended the day inside the top end of the Bollinger bands and they appear to not be contracting yet on the daily chart.  
\-20 DMA and 50DMA have just crossed. This is called a golden cross and the 200DMA is now beginning to slope upwards.  
\-Large amount of strength in the $13.00 range. If you look back at the hourly chart above where we ended Friday you can see where it is flat in comparison to on Wednesday. This shows strong support in this range and will be a powerful foundation to build a cup and handle formation. This range was also significant in the previous run in January

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qj063yzybp371.png?width=1868&format=png&auto=webp&s=703841beac1005b97a1849c19ddc18187fee799f

\-Still a large following and people interested in $BB this weekend across forums, subreddits, and media. #1 ticker on WSB Thursday and Friday.  
\-Largest open interest of stock options is $20 USD.  
\-Put/call ratio still relatively low  
\-Small short shares available (Squeeze is in the realm of possibilities again)  
\-RSI looks healthy on the hourly for a dead cat bounce at open  
\-Currently, one of the best plays technically speaking but also fundamentally for the long term (1-2 years+).  
\-I have confirmation bias because cybersecurity is a massive growth market. If you didn't hear, JBS is the world's largest supplier of beef, and got hacked might actually cause a shortage of beef in the supermarkets or a large squeeze in beef prices. Go long on beef and cybersecurity.  
\-Institutions are still accumulating. Remember, around 48% of BB is owned by institutions and insiders. This is massive. One of the largest companies with large institutional ownership is Microsoft at \~70% or Facebook with an %80. We aren't that far off with a much much lower share count.

If the share price goes down significantly tomorrow I'll post another update, only because if the share price goes down with such a small amount of short shares available I believe this will only be tightening the slingshot further that would rocket $BB's share price to the $30s.

Things that we need to continue to look for:  
\-High volume  
\-Amount of posts and articles about $BB on Reddit, commercial websites, and other forums  
\-News or statements from $BB. One piece of news that's significant could be the catalyst to a moonshot.

This week's price target remains the same as what I wanted on Friday. Anywhere $24-$33USD.

Institutional investors have increased, this may be the sign that some investing firms are betting AMC‚Äôs passionate retail investor are becoming increasingly  loyal consumers.  One could argue that they may be buying these stocks to lend them as shorts, however I believe that may hold a significant percentage. They realize what is happening is in fact without exaggeration: 
Historic.

In a nutshell if the retail investor can spend hours on social media focused on AMC and spend their hard earned cash on billboard, planes, strong DD, creating YouTube stars, and gather international new fans

*well...as an investor you bet they can afford a 10$ movie ticket for a 60 foot screen watching a great film.*

You might need a drink and popcorn, perhaps tendies, either way you‚Äôll enjoy a different type of experience that you would have at home. Perhaps it‚Äôs a date or just something different to do. If the movie was epic, it becomes a memorable event ‚Äú ya I remember this movie, I saw it in theatres, in fact I was with ... ‚Äú


Even without a squeeze it is increasingly becoming apparent that AMC will generate revenue at increasing rates. In fact the passion of retail investors who for the first time ever own the majority of AMC, love this Company. 

Whoever tells you cinemas are dead does not understand that for the entirety of its history the cinema industry made more Ticket sales in this day and age then ever before . Take a look at the past 10 years of box office hits, they are record breaking compared to to its previous 100 years of history. 

It‚Äôs hard to bet against what is currently happening. In fact it‚Äôs never been done in the history of AMC or the stock market. 
- congress acknowledged 
- new fans around the world 
- social media and the power of the internet 
- planes, billboard, receipts, celebrities, word of mouth, news, and it continues growing.

207,TWNK,nvhe4k,2021-06-09 01:13:28,Hostess? Is it time to go balls deep in $TWNK for Pride month üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà ?,"Last week I saw Hostess ($TWNK) mentioned by someone in the daily thread. The ticker caught my eye and inspired me to do some DD into the company. Here is what I found:

* Hostess was taken public after filing and emerging for bankruptcy in 2012. Since then it has has strong revenue growth over the past 20 quarters
* The company is now highly profitable and it has weathered the pandemic well.  Gross profit in the past 12 months has been $371 Million, up 39% compared to two years ago.
* Hostess is funneling much of its profits into its business for future growth. It is also rapidly growing its [market share in the Sweet Baked Goods category](https://www.hostessbrands.com/static-files/e20aeeb6-2880-4278-a362-f222573d81f6)
* The company is in the process of reinventing itself and the products it offers. They have announced plans and capital expenditures to break into the morning convenience food market.
* They have also recently expanded their leadership team and appointed [this absolute stud](https://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2021/05/28/hostess-chief-growth-officer-dan-oleary.html) as their new Chief Growth Officer.
* Altogether this puts TWNK is in the much-coveted position of being both a value (think Warren buffett) and growth (thing Bill hwang) type stock. At the moment, there is no dividend as the company is reinvesting cash into its business for future growth, but there are plans for future stock buybacks in 2022 and beyond.
* ANALysts love the stock. The consensus from analysts is Very Bullish (out of the 11 analysts that have covered the stock, 2 TWNK is a strong buy, 6 say its a buy, and 3 say its a hold.

*Now let‚Äôs talk shorts*

* Short interest is 20.77% of the float  That‚Äôs higher than most meme tickers here (comparable to AMC GME, much higher than BB, WEN, etc). Furthermore, short interest has [increased 44%](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/TWNK/short-interest/) since the start of January are we‚Äôre starting to see a number of pops this spring from [failed to deliver shares](https://sec.report/fails.php?tc=TWNK).
* The stock has very low volume right now (only an average of 1.2M shares traded per day). If a squeeze were to happen, at the current volume it would take shorts a month to cover.
* Additionally, 123.67% of all the float is held by institutions, and very little by retail meaning that any significant volume will send the stock flying.
* If TWNK turns into a crusade against shorty, I could see us squeezing to $69. *Right the stock is only at a 2B market cap so there‚Äôs plenty of room to grow*

That‚Äôs about it thank you for reading to the end. Despite the meme potential and parallels to GME, this stock has surprisingly flown under this sub‚Äôs radar so far . There were a few posts back in January (see [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lahib2/twinkies_for_tendies_long_thesis_on_hostess/)  for more extensive DD) that didn‚Äôt catch on, but with it being meme season and Pride month üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüåàüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà, I could see $TWNK possibly flying past the moon and straight into Uranus üçëü™ê

Position: Currently schLONG 69 shares and got a couple of Jun 18 $17.50 FDs

To qualify for the credit, the transportation fuel must be produced at a qualified facility and sold by the taxpayer to an unrelated person (1) for use by such person in the production of a fuel mixture, (2) for use by such person in a trade or business, or (3) who sells such fuel at retail into the fuel tank of another person. The credit would be subject to phase-out if the annual greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation of persons and goods annually in the United States are determined to be equal to or less than 25 percent of the annual greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation of persons and goods in the United States for calendar year 2021.*
* ***Alternative Fuel Refueling Property Credit****. Section 30C(a) provides a credit of 30 percent of the cost of any qualified alternative fuel vehicle refueling property placed in service by the taxpayer during the taxable year, subject to a credit cap. The key changes in the bill would be to increase the Section 30C credit cap from $30,000 to $200,000, in the case of qualified property that is depreciable property, and to expand the definition of qualifying fuels to consist of hydrogen and any transportation fuel for which the Clean Fuel Production Credit is allowed. (I think this is about new rng fueling stations).*

* Resting on volume shelf below ‚Äî if it dips, watch for a bounce (hopefully) off the $8.50 - $8.75 area, buyers seems to be interested in that level.

* Breakout levels to watch marked on chart with the thick dotted line: $9.25 and $10.56. These are levels I drew myself and are definitely **not** 100% accurate.

&#x200B;

* Above $10.56 looking at a resistance volume shelfs between $12 - $13, then a smaller shelf between $14 - $14.30. Above that looking at relatively smooth sailing to break through all time highs of $17.45.

217,EV,nmcz56,2021-05-27 19:42:04,"This is my EV play. DD on BB, SONY, VW, Volvo.","Hey all - I am a huge auto enthusiast and been following the industry closely. This is how I‚Äôm betting on EVs.

BB:
60 $30c 01/2022 at $0.27
üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ


Already powering many of the telematics of current cars, BB is poised to benefit from their established relationships with big automakers. Getting certified with an automaker is not easy, so it is a barrier to entry for other companies wanting in on the action. Security and reliability are top of mind for these companies. You don‚Äôt want your car to get hacked easily, so what better than a cybersecurity company that happens to also do EV software, and already has experience with ICE cars. I did a long DD here 4 months ago and still stand by it: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxknrl/bb_dd_9_reasons_why_bb_is_from_former_bb_employee/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf


SONY:
100 shares at $101
üöÄüöÄüöÄ


I wouldn‚Äôt call this the Japanese equivalent for BB, as they aren‚Äôt a cybersecurity company. But Sony has a thriving consumer and B2B business that benefits greatly from consumer demand: the fact that they are literally selling every single PS5 they make is amazing and image sensors going out on many cell phones, including Apple using both image and lidar sensors from Sony. Great solid volume of sales to stabilize the company after some stagnant years.

On PS5, it‚Äôs actually a good thing that there‚Äôs a chip shortage. As Sony loses money on the hardware (and earn on game royalties and licenses), they are buying time to refine their manufacturing to lower costs, and lose less money on hardware sales. And because demand is so hot for the PS5, they are on track to build a bigger platform than even PS4 to charge 20-30% on every game they sell. That‚Äôs some fat margin.

Now, you‚Äôre probably wondering‚Ä¶wtf, I‚Äôm here to read about EVs, why you telling me about PS5s? Yeah, you‚Äôre right but a conglomerate like Sony is multifaceted. While they build up their EV software platform, they have cash cows in imagery and video games. And if Apple is really building an EV, I would bet (am literally betting) that they would rely on currently trusted partners like Sony for their imaging needs. You sit inside an Apple car and camera recognizes who you are and where you‚Äôre sitting? Well that‚Äôs probably a Sony camera‚Ä¶or 20 of them. There will be so many cameras inside and outside of any Apple car. I mean‚Ä¶my iPhone 12 has 4 cameras, and it‚Äôs a tiny slab of glass and my family can‚Äôt sit inside and drive down the road with others in the environment.

And when Japanese automakers get into EVs, they‚Äôll look into a Japanese partnership. Guess who‚Äôs probably in pole position?

Full disclosure, I also have 150 AAPL.



VW:
200 shares @ $33.32
üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

You are all excited about Ford. I am too but I‚Äôm not buying into them because I think they are overhyped. But what‚Äôs interesting about Ford‚Äôs EV play is that they are partnering with VW to do so. That means‚Ä¶even if Ford can‚Äôt sell that many cars, VW will probably still benefit from joint research development and cost sharing. We also know how much more climate change is viewed as reality in Europe, and that‚Äôs VW‚Äôs home territory. VW already launching EVs under Audi, Porsche in the premium sector, VW, Skoda and Seat in the value sector, and Bentley and Lamborghini will likely have their ultra premium EVs soon.

But you might wonder‚Ä¶what about Tesla? They are so great! Well yeah they aren‚Äôt that bad. But VW is a goddamn monster. It‚Äôs kind of cute when Tesla announces a new plant, oh this is my 4th plant! We now have Shanghai and Fremont and building out Berlin and Austin. That‚Äôs cute. VW has 136 plants around the world. The economies of scale is insane and will be able to source materials for incredibly better deals. Oh and there‚Äôs that other partner called Ford who builds millions of cars a year also jumping into to beat on suppliers to give them both better pricing. Welcome to the big leagues, EVs.

VW is likely to launching 5-10 EVs per year, the equivalent the full Tesla line up every year. And they have Electricfy America network (and Canada) and similar in Europe.

And one more thing: VW also does trucks. Like 18 wheeler trucks. They are one of the biggest manufacturers, behind brands such as Man, Scania, and Navistar. And trucks have even more of a compelling business case for EVs‚Ä¶Will merge this part with Volvo.


Volvo:
800 shares @ $26
üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ


Going to keep this briefer because this is already a novel. Now, when I say Volvo, I don‚Äôt mean Volvo Cars. That‚Äôs bought by Geely and yes they are making EVs under Volvo and Polestar brands. But I‚Äôm taking about AB Volvo, still out of Sweden, building trucks, mining equipment, backhoes, haul trucks and cranes.

EVs are so more more compelling because of the use and mileage they get. It‚Äôs not uncommon for a one year old truck to have a million miles. And as cities around the world clamp down on urban center access (congestion or polluter fees common in Europe, and allow EVs in for discount or free), EVs increasingly make more sense. You save so much on lower op/maintenance costs, avoiding tolls and tax credits. Oil prices will be going back up so saving on fuel costs is the smart thing to do.

Another thing is, governments around the world are spending trillions on infrastructure stimulus. What do these trillions buy? Concrete, steel, Volvo construction equipment, labor. Where does the concrete, steel and other commodities (like rising gold and silver prices) come from? They get mined out of the ground with big Caterpillar, Liebherr and Volvo equipment. Yep, there‚Äôs Volvo again!

So if you believe stimulus is happening, Volvo is a good choice. If you believe inflation is real, Volvo is a good choice. If you believe EV is the future for hauling shorter distances and/or heavy loads, Volvo is a good choice.

224,BB,nuou81,2021-06-07 23:59:53,Where can BB make it too besides the moon?,"I've been reading the BB tape for months. There is usually a very aggressive daily short position that takes about 20,000-40,000 shares after the open and keeps the price down. It generally stair steps the price down all day. It disappeared on the tape the moment it broke over 10 bucks. My guess is the big guys are ready to let the price start to sore. I doubt the real shorts went anywhere except for shorting at the top of key resistance levels.

If BB Ape buyers keep up the buying then BB could be sitting between extremely high historic levels at 42.49, 68.33, 85.32, AND 124.24 in a manner of weeks/months. Unlike AMC or GME, BB has historic levels to work off. That gives days traders and institutions a guide to trade and they will absolutely make those willing to take the risk a killing as this keeps going to their upper ranges. It will eventually be trading like the Internet of Things/Cyber Security that it is becoming before it monetizes and current buyers will just get in the ground floor and make some decent cash for their investment. When BB comes out showing that it has began to monetize the real accumulation phase will be over because the price will already be trading at the new ranges. Think TSLA, CCIV, etc. They all traded over their values highly and then fell back to earth before going back up. They whipsaw so that the big players can make money off selling high and buying low. Translate screw retail traders that buy high and then think its all over and sell low only to watch it rip again. 

My guess is that the sweet high spot of 85.32 is where BB will head to before a fall  for back to that 68.33 level. It will then  trade in range up towards 85.32 for a while. It will trade in a range for several months or up to a year or so before a rip beyond 85 to around the all time highs mentioned above as this becomes the new accumulation phase. The Prem Watsa's (Warren Buffett of Canada) will get BB to somewhere between the 70 and 80s before stepping off the gas and letting the shares fall back to no lower than the 20s-30s so they can acquire them again at a discount. Their motto is buy wholesale and sale retail. That is exactly what they did after the January surge. They bought every share they could at a discount and of course they sold some in the 10-20 range and will just buy more.

BlackBerry is only beginning its journey, and the fundamentals back this up.

QNX Software - is already being tested out by automakers like Volvo, for use in their industrial vehicles. Where self driving tech is expensive for civilian cars, it could pay for itself when applied to truck convoys and public transport.

IVY - linked in with BlackBerrys autonomous vehicle software, IVY is a way of collecting driver data to further help consumers even after buying their vehicle. Information on thing like acceleration and braking,  safe lane merging etc; drivers that drive safely could be offered discounted insurance prices. This data is also highly promising to help with accident insurance claims proving what driver is to fault.

Cylance + Cyber Sevices - basically SkyNet, proven to be extremely effective in the field, and constantly evolves to prevent threats before they strike.

2021 5G Phone - Not talked about much, but a new BlackBerry mobile phone is slated for a late 2021 release. Only phone releasing with a physical keyboard, runs Android and boasts decent specs at a $500 price point.

Low cost natural gas supplies in the US have already made the US one of the world's largest LNG exporters with Cheniere Energy (Ticker: LNG) being the largest US one. Cheniere's founder is the founder of Tellurian (Ticker: TELL).

Charif Souki (former CEO of Cheniere) was ousted from there by activist shareholder, Carl Icahn, and started TELL.

I believe he and the team at TELL - he is Executive Chairman - will do better. Unlike Cheniere, TELL has its own natgas production source and will have its own pipeline network to supply from there to its planned liquefaction plant at Lake Charles plus that network will connect with other natgas supply sources available also, as shown below...

Pipeline network: https://ibb.co/2KCHnnj

That owned Haynesville source means their pricing will be lower than Henry Hub prices that dictate Cheniere's and most other US LNG exporters prices. This from the slide show I linked in above shows TELL's price calculation...

LNG pricing: https://ibb.co/yFNbD4B

TELL's opportunity:

Spot LNG prices in Asia are usually double to triple the price of US LNG. Since such commodities win on price TELL has an enormous price advantage as an exporter at a time when demand is likely to exceed supply for a long time.

237,MT,n9lrmg,2021-05-11 03:37:44,MT - Possible Value Play?,"Now I know you fucktards only want plays that will bend you over backward and fuck your financial futures, but hear me out.    


Yadda yadda, not financial advice, if you buy yourself a ticket to Ramenistan that's on you. My favorite color of crayon is purple.

I'm new to this sort of thing (first write-up I've ever made lol) so I want holes to be poked in this relatively surface level DD. I'm also not the most knowledgeable on the intricacies of the steel manufacturing industry, since I'm going off of pure numbers.

With COVID recovery underway and the slow unfreezing of world economies, steel companies have been outperforming the S&P 500 by large margins, and this is one of those companies. I've noticed that compared to other players in the steel industry (X, NUE, STLD for example) MT's price is much lower than these players, and yet their fundamentals are roughly the same, if not better.

All statistics here are pulled off of [barchart.com](https://barchart.com/) and Yahoo Finance.

Bull indicators that stand out to me

* P/B and P/E indicate undervaluation
* Relatively benign ROE and ROA, and yet other companies are trading at higher prices than MT
* Competitors who are smaller cap are trading at much higher prices

Bear / Neutral Indicators

* Negative profit margin (which can possibly be indicative of repayment of debt or new acquisitions)
* High amount of stock issued - dilution contributing to the lower trading price

On the fundamental  side of things, if a second wave of COVID hits, infrastructure and building development will begin to lower demand, thereby reducing price. However, the US government's infrastructure development plans could offset any pitfalls in demand made by COVID. ArcelorMittal also holds the #1 spot as the world's premiere steel producer, with a presence in around 60 countries and has consistently growing sales figures. ArcelorMittal is also looking to reduce their carbon footprint through innovating in their daily operations.

This isn't the kind of play you'd buy FDs on and embody the spirit of Analfarmer, so I'd invest for a 9 month - 3 year timeframe. 

This is just what I've found, I'd like other opinions and counterpoints to the data I've scrounged up here. And things I missed / misinterpreting with my data. If something looks retarded, that means it probably is, so please point it out for both of our sakes.

Currently have no positions in it. If you want to inverse what I'd do, I'd buy LEAPs nine months to a year out, or buy shares (contrary to popular WSB belief, calls are not the only thing you can buy on your Robinhood account, still not refunds though)",Discussion,0.84

243,AMC,nlw3ty,2021-05-27 03:00:08,Why Cinema Stocks like AMC will benefit from reopening?,"Hi Everyone! I did some research on cinema stocks a while back and made a video on it. I didn't post the content here so I thought I would share it as I know everyone is interested in AMC at the moment! I know it's a lot to read so if you prefer to watch the video, the link for that is also included below:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRNn2bOC1xo&t=6s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRNn2bOC1xo&t=6s)

Why Cinema Stocks like AMC will benefit from reopening? 

Time-Frame: Cinema‚Äôs will benefit from reopening and the economic recovery that is occurring all over the world. Especially over a longer timeframe.  I think that Cinemas can be a good trade in the medium term and can help you make money. It‚Äôs all dependent on data and how quickly things go back to normal, but my timeframe on this trade right now is 1-2 years. Maybe even shorter, perhaps 6 months if we bounce back very quickly. Maybe not the most likely, but still a possible scenario that I have to consider. 

&#x200B;

Thesis: 

1)  The Covid-19 pandemic has had a very strong negative impact on the cinema sector. So, naturally as things reopen and vaccinations increase all over North America, these companies stand to benefit. If we look back from the end of January 2020 to the end of April 2021, Marcus Corporation was down approximately 33% from January 27th, 2020. Cinemark is down approximately 35% over the same time period, while National CineMedia is down almost 42% and AMC is up almost 57%. Price is an important factor to consider when buying and selling stocks and this something that is important to consider 

2) Cinemas have suffered tremendously with the Covid-19 pandemic, which makes the cinema sector intriguing as the world re-opens. If we look to Asia, especially China and Japan, where Covid-19 cases subsided and theatres reopened, things look promising.  There was a substantial increase in demand, with demand actually higher than pre-pandemic levels. In China, December 2020 ticket sales at IMAX‚Äôs big-screen theatres jumped 28 per cent from a year earlier, while in Japan, they broke daily records and a record number of people saw movies on the first weekend of January 2021. Clearly, there was a lot of pent-up demand which surfaced and benefitted movie theatres in Asia. 

3) And you know what I‚Äôve seen this film before. Last year early in February, there was a sudden spike in downloads of the Zoom app in China, and the stock at that was point already doing well, up roughly 30 percent from the start of the year. But this spike in Zoom usage soon spread all over the world, and the rest is history. It was an absolutely humungous winner last year. There are obviously sector wide risks with consumer preferences changing, and more and more people preferring to watch films at home. The increase in Netflix & streaming service subscribers over the years is a clear indication of consumer preferences going-forward, but I do like movie theatres as a trade. There is a lot of pent-up demand that I feel will benefit the sector. 

Risks: 

\-  One of the main risks that that most people who are considering trading or investing in cinema companies have, is the risk from Netflix and the other streaming services. Really the risk of the Direct-to-consumer approach and the effects that it will have on the cinema companies. And this is a valid concern because it has reduced demand for cinemas over the last decade. Even some of the biggest filmmakers in the world are turning to it, like Martin Scorsese, Noah Baumbach and Alfonso Cuaron.  Netflix has become the biggest movie studio in the world, at-least when it comes to volume in terms of production over the last several years. And now they plan to release 50-60 films per year, and with their pioneering Direct to Consumer approach, the film industry has changed. Cinemas are no longer at the forefront, and the Direct-to-Consumer strategy is quickly becoming the new incumbent. The DTC approach is taking over, with all the streaming services that have launched. They have taken market share from linear television and have steered consumers away from traditional Cinema.

Catalysts & Conclusion: 

1) However, I still think there is still a place for theatres, even with streaming, especially looking at the same timeframe that I‚Äôm focusing on for this trade. I think now more so than ever people want to be outside. These businesses will benefit from the change in near term consumer trends, with everyone wanting to leave the house. I really believe that the cinema sector is going to do well in North America. If Asia is anything to go by and I think it is, some of the companies involved in the sector have the potential to be great trades. People still want to go to the cinemas, especially when it comes to seeing some of the big budget films that are really made for the big screen. Blockbuster action films with awesome effects are really meant to be seen in a movie theatre in my opinion. The effects and the environment simply cannot be replicated at home. Especially when it comes to immersive experience films, like those with IMAX and 4DX. I really enjoy the cinema and think there is something to be said for being in a big space in a dark room watching a film 40 feet across. It is wonderful to sit in the comfort of your own home but there is just something to be said for having a community experience in a room. But that‚Äôs neither there nor here. 

  
2) Moving on, another potential catalyst is the potential for collaboration between theatre chains and streaming services. Netflix was the one to pioneer the Direct to Consumer, but interestingly they have begun releasing some Netflix Originals on the big screen in recent years. Films like The Irishman, Marriage Story and The Two Popes all premiered in Cinemas prior to their appearance in Netflix‚Äôs online catalogue.  This is a really interesting move on their part, especially from an investment perspective. Because, while you can watch streaming services in the comfort of your own home, movie theatre companies are open to the idea of having the films that are produced by the streaming services shown in their theatres. Cinemark has shown Netflix movies in theatres in the past, and there is an off chance that they expand their agreement. This wouldn‚Äôt just apply to Cinemark but other theatre chains as well potentially. The big hold-up between the streaming services and theatre chains was the disagreement on the length of theatrical window. But last year, Universal Studios and Cinemark, AMC & Cineplex agreed to a shortened exclusive window, from 74 days to 31 days for major films, as defined by box-office domestic revenue. This makes it more likely that Netflix and other streaming services can find middle ground with the cinema companies. It‚Äôs not all that important a catalyst for the trade, nor is it all that likely, but it is still intriguing and something to consider.

3) A more important catalyst is the release of the next James Bond film, no time to die next year. I‚Äôm really excited about the movie because I‚Äôm a huge James Bond fan. It‚Äôs probably my favourite movie series. And you know what, I‚Äôm not alone. It‚Äôs very popular all over the world. The previous James Bond film, Spectre, grossed nearly $879 million. No Time To Die has been postponed several times due to the pandemic and is due to premiere on October 8th in the United States. I‚Äôm really excited about the movie and will be sure to see in theatres provided it‚Äôs safe to do so. And I think it will be. This movie is really important for the movie theatres because they have been starved and there have just been very few films to show. They have been supply constrained with the lack of new films. No Time To Die is a certain blockbuster and will really help benefit the sector. 

4) Something else that has me really excited is the recent CDC news in the US, with them updating guidance on April 2nd that fully vaccinated people can travel internationally safely and don‚Äôt need to quarantine when they return provided, they test negative within three to five days of their return. They have to test negative before they are allowed to board a return flight to the US. This is really exciting, and this combined with the idea of a vaccine passport as has been proposed by cruise lines and the UK government really provide a lot of momentum for the cinema companies.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/0l28v9tzna471.png?width=1913&format=png&auto=webp&s=31ba3f9fe9554ce6010aaa36cc8616f11ef10ff4)

Dear retards,

Today  I was doing my DD‚Äôs and while doing my wacc, roe and other bullshit  analysis I had the smart idea to have a look at the Short Interest of  sndl.

While looking at it I was  astonished by the data reported by Bloomberg terminal. Our  short-interest ratio is 1.44, while amc is only 0.53 and gme 1.45  (source: Bloomberg terminal).

This means that the number of shorted shares is 1.44 times higher than the average trading volume which is absolutely crazy!!!!

The  percentage of the float is around 15%, however, the data of float  percentage has not been updated yet. IMO we could easily be at around  20, as gme and amc.

The main thing differentiating us from AMC and GME is the SI Score provided by Bloomberg terminal √† 2nd

amc is just 5th whereas gme 4th

To conclude the S3 rate temperature, indicating the seasoned financing levels with 1, 50 or 100

1= Liquid borrows typically indicating a short interest at or below historic terms

50= Marginally higher borrow levels typically indicating somewhat elevated short interest

100= Increased borrow levels typically indicating elevated short interest.

We  are currently at 50, ( gme stands at 1 (source Bloomberg terminal)) and  even in this case, the data have not yet been updated from the previous  month‚Ä¶.

The SQUEEZE is near we all need to hold sundial !!!!

Cheers and have a good day y‚Äôall degenerates

P.S. This is not a financial advice, I‚Äôm just posting for fun and for educational purpose. Have a good day and make DD‚Äôs :)

You're making money right now on $GME, $AMC, $BB, or whatever. Allow me to introduce you to a company with boomer level fundamentals that took a haircut during the pandemic and is set to fucking explode. 


The company name is Tellurian, ticker is $TELL.


--------MY KNOWLEDGE AND BACKGROUND----------

Even though I have a double digit IQ, I am in charge of keeping energy producers from blowing up, spilling fuck loads of oil, catching shit on fire, and/or keeping seafood fresh and hydrocarbon free. I've been in the business for many moons. I have dealt with MANY companies. I‚Äôve seen MANY business types, I have seen transitions in business models as producers have dealt with energy price crashes. I work directly with company executives all the way down to operators and hands. I like talking to everyone and absorbing as much knowledge as I can, even though I‚Äôm mentally retarded.

Even though you morons can‚Äôt read, have your wife‚Äôs/gf‚Äôs boyfriend read this to you and DRILL it in your fucking smooth brain: LIQUID NATURAL GAS (LNG) DEMAND IS RISING AND WILL CONTINUE TO RISE FOR THE NEXT DECADE (‚ÄúdEcAde‚Äù is a period of ten years for you single digit IQ fucks) AND BEYOND. LNG will be the ‚Äútransition‚Äù fuel between dirtier energy sources and ""green"" energy. This transition is coming sooner than we think. 


Are you following?


What's this LNG, you might ask. You need to liquefy gas (basically ‚Äúconcentrating‚Äù it) so that it becomes economical to ship overseas. Overseas markets for LNG is massive and growing. Seriously look it up, EU, China, and others are increasingly relying on the stuff. It‚Äôs much more expensive for them to produce than the US.

When a producer (the company that puts together millions of dollars to drill a well) drills for oil, if your drill and zone prediction (a ‚Äúzone‚Äù is the area that a geologist, paid for by the producer, finds to contain oil) is correct, 99% of the time, three products will flow to the earth‚Äôs surface in your process. These three are water, oil, and NATURAL GAS. Producers will separate oil and water dispose of this waste water into a disposal well thousands and thousands of feet deep. Producers will then sell the oil.‚Ä¶ What happens to the gas?? Well, if the producer is lucky, there will be a pipeline within a mile or two of their well. They will have to pay WAY over 200K to 500K just welding a mile of gas pipeline to tie into this sales line then pay 100 to 250K for a LACT unit. This is why oilfield welders have fewer IQs than I do but make $150/hr, depending upon pipeline wall thickness (dependent upon flowing pressures and how safe the producer wants to be if not bound by DOT regulations)

If these costs aren‚Äôt too high, and the well is producing as much product as expected, then great, they sell gas. However, if they're producing less oil than predicted, or they're producing thousand of barrels of water per day, their disposal costs will be so high, they can‚Äôt afford to build the pipeline, they will just burn the stuff. Seriously, I can not tell you HOW MUCH GAS IS JUST BURNED. The VAST majority of producers just ‚Äúflare‚Äù the gas. Just the ‚Äúflare‚Äù vessel is like $30K. Imaging paying $30K to burn LNG that's worth 100s of thousands of dollars. I worked in the Permian basin in West Texas. Anyone here with this experience can vouch for me. At night, in the Permian, the sky is literally lit up with these flares. It‚Äôs like you're a goddamn ant on a fucking birthday cake that‚Äôs for both for your great great great mothers and her boyfriend‚Äôs birthday (basically a shit load of candles). It‚Äôs an amazing sight.

¬≠---------wWhY dO tHeY DoO WasTE gAAS??------------------

You‚Äôre in the middle of fucking NOWHERE. You‚Äôd have to run hundreds of miles of pipeline to sell the gas. This would cost more than drilling the well. No company in their right mind would do this. The only options is to flare it. This one company I was working for was burning over 100K worth of natural gas per MONTH PER WELL, they had FIVE wells. The US just burns the crap, we can produce it so cheap, it just makes more sense to burn it rather than bothering to sell it. Gas is a nuisance to us. Other countries would die for it. There is actually new technologies that converts LNG into GASOLINE for cars. If you‚Äôre a stupid brain dead fuck who doesn't believe me, fucking Google it. 



-------So what about this TeLlUriAn coMpaNIee?-----------

Charif Souki started Tellurian. If you don‚Äôt know who he is, he is a LNG god. He was a banker on Wall St, highest paid CEO years ago, pioneered the LNG industry. He and his team are impeccable. If you want to build a LNG empire, you hire Souki, if you want to know the future of hydrocarbon energy, you hire Souki, if you want a new boyfriend for your wife, you hire Souki. He built Cheniere Enerny (about 2 hours from my house), a company with $10billion in revenue and is trading $80/share. 
He was fired because Carl Ichan was a complete bully. The business was not being built to Soukies vision. Soukie took the best staff members along with him and started Tellurian. Can you imagine their trust in this guy? Leaving an established company to start a new one... LNG business model is requiring a change and Soukie realizes this. It will need to be produced at less cost, current business models aren‚Äôt sustainable. Cheniere Energy is over 20 BILLION dollars in debt. Yes, $20 BILLIOOONNNNNNNN. Guess how much debt Tellurian has? ZERO, NONE, $0.00. This is UNHEARD of in a new company in this industry. 

Tellurian just signed a 10 BILLION dollar purchase agreement from ONE company. TELL is currently talking deals with at least 4 other companies. This 10 billion dollar deal is a 10 year agreement. This is 1 billion per year. Their current market cap is just over 1 billion. Do you realize yet how undervalued this company is?? It‚Äôs mind blowing. They begin their Driftwood facility construction in Louisiana this summer. This will be the terminal to export LNG, 32 billion dollar project.

Do you know whats even better?? They wont completely rely on third party producers selling them gas to liquefy, BECAUSE THEY DRILL AND PRODUCE THEIR OWN GAS. They started drilling again after a brief pause due to covid-19. We pay for monthly reports of all producers who receive state permits for drilling. Just this month Tellurian has TWO permits.

Souki uploads regularly to YouTube (seriously what other major high level executive does this??), he was on Jim Cramers show multiple times, Jim Cramer was always contrary to Souki‚Äôs predictions, and SOUKI ALWAYS turned out RIGHT. Look it up, these are Jim Crammer‚Äôs words, NOT mine. Just a day or two ago, Souki said in his YouTube video ‚Äúwe are preparing for the ride of a lifetime.‚Äù I assume this is his way of telling us ‚Äúbuy in now you fucking retards‚Äù without being fined by the SEC.

------------HOW is ThiS LIKE GME, AMC, BB?-----------------

THE SHORT POSITIONS OMG YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS BY NOW. IT‚ÄôS 17%!! Most of these positions were taken out at pandemic start. The joke is on them, Tellurian paid off their debts during their worst time HAHAHAHAHA. There WILL be a short squeeze. These shorts have no fucking clue about this dream team, the true depth of industry, and future of LNG production. 


---------------------hOw MuchH CanI MAKe?---------------------

At the VERY VERY least, I‚Äôm betting we run to pandemic level of $10-11/share (REMEMBER THIS WAS BEFORE THEY EVEN SIGNED ANY PURCHASE AGREEMENTS!!!). Calls are still cheap.



------------------------------PROOFS----------------------------------lll--------

257,TA,nhyj2a,2021-05-21 19:50:01,Tilray (TLRY) MACD Momentum Shift - Quantitative TA,"**Before I talk Technical Analysis (TA), it is important to understand the following:**

Technical Analysis is absolute meaningless astrology unless the strategies and indicators used are statistically/quantitatively *proven to be meaningful*. There are a lot of articles being published (and even shared here) about TLRY's TA - ignore them. They have zero weight on Tilray's future. Most of these chart patterns, strategies, theories, ideas, etc. taught in traditional trading education come from early 1900's anecdotal theories, which were nothing more than early, primitive attempts to identify patterns in markets. But, this is a story and an explanation for another time.

**In-Depth MACD Explanation:**

Since it's a popular retail indicator, most of you probably already know what the Moving Average Converence/Divergence (MACD) is. However, it's usually not well understood. The MACD takes in three settings for Moving Averages (MA) and the two lines plotted on the indicator are calculated as so:

MACD Line: Short MA - Long MA

Signal Line: Signal MA of the MACD Line

This is actually an incredibly clever way of measuring momentum and trend-following. By taking the difference between two different MA periods, we get a second-derivative (i.e. acceleration). By default, the MACD is calculated an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with period settings (12, 26, 9).

**So, onto TLRY's** ***potential*** **momentum shift:**

*Note that I said ""potential,"" because the land of quantitative/algorithmic trading is nothing more than a probability game developed through hypothesis testing.*

Today, TLRY experienced a MACD crossover with MACD settings (SMA, 28, 48, 32). Why these settings? Because I ran a statistical backtest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and simulated over 140,000 settings in an attempt to find the best practical combination to signal price change over the next few days via MACD crossover (Fun fact: using a Simple Moving Average (SMA) *always* yields better results, no matter what symbol or asset class).

If I were to buy every MACD (SMA, 28, 48, 32) crossover at the daily closing price and hold for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days, what would my results be? Here's the results for the SPY since 2003:

https://preview.redd.it/z8gvmc77ml071.png?width=1885&format=png&auto=webp&s=7584983651d13d7a8304098dffcd011109fc12e3

Positive mean returns and a high win frequency are significant, with the 1st day after buying being the most important. So, now that we've seen it's general significance in large-cap, what are the backtested results for TLRY? Well, it's tough because Tilray hasn't had a publicly traded stock for very long, so the sample size is insufficiently small. But, take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/aa8ly369ml071.png?width=1932&format=png&auto=webp&s=67b2c365b81e385f25387cee225ea73634f84126

It still holds some significance with the positive means and win frequencies. But obviously with only 9 crossovers happening in TLRY's lifetime, we can't take these numbers and fit them to any model.

**So, using the most statistically effective MACD period settings, TLRY** ***may*** **be getting a shift in momentum here fairly soon!**

I understand that my initial claims for the (28, 48, 32) settings were only tested on the SPY, and Tilray isn't large-cap growth. There is still more testing and solidifying to do.

258,UWMC,nuhu4k,2021-06-07 19:12:05,UWMC - Is this time to finally move the bull?,"With the upcoming dividend exclusion date (6/9/... nice... 2021) the MM who have been relentlessly battling the shareholders, by shorting half of the daily volumes to keep the stock flat, are in a predicament that they have to either cover their shorts or pay the dividend. This combined with a 38% borrowing fee for new shorts gives great opportunity for the stock to gain some much needed traction. As of now we can see several EFTs (Vangard) purchasing shares to qualify for the dividend and can expect other large firms to do so in the next couple of days. Other catalysts include a buyback of 300M announced by UWMC and a potential Russell 3000 inclusion (if anyone can figure out what inclusion/exclusion qualifiers to follow). All that said, it‚Äôs plain and simple. This stock needs some volume to really take off and we should get a preview in the next few day. Note: All data/numbers are from Fintel.

260,ACT,nn326f,2021-05-28 19:33:28,MORE ACT / CANNABIS / $SNDL &amp; $TLRY Potential,"What up peeps. I want to cover two tickers here, $SNDL which currently meets the sidebar rules with today's move. 1.6B market cap and is trading above $1. I get it mods, you gonna mod but I'll keep writing. The other is the infamous $TLRY.   


The News...

If you haven't read yet it looks like Federal Cannabis legalization my be around the corner. [Here](https://www.mpp.org/policy/federal/the-more-act/) is the House Bill. Supporters seem on board and like the reforms they have done to the bill including rescheduling cannabis. [Last time](https://mjbizdaily.com/key-us-house-lawmaker-reintroduces-federal-marijuana-legalization-bill/) the bill was introduced it cleared the House.   


Personally I think this gets a lot of support especially from a fiscal point of view. With stimulus stalling and a giant debate going on about how to pay for the stimulus I think cannabis offers the easiest way to collect federal revenue. A simple review of the bill and the fiscal benefits to the Fed's can be read [here](https://www.justtherealnews.com/congress/nadler-blumenauer-lee-jackson-lee-jeffries-velazquez-reintroduce-comprehensive-marijuana-reform-legislation/). The bill states a 5% fed tax. Money coming for uncle Sam, right when questions about paying for stimulus.... Personally I think it adds up, but that's for you to decide. 

Okay so that's the hype...

Let's talk about the tickers listed ($SNDL and $TLRY). 

$SNDL

I'll start with the cheaper YOLO, $SNDL. $SNDL short interest isn't high, but the company did issue convertible notes a while back around .7c if my memory is correct. I'm not saying they won't do it again, but they should be in a good place fiscally for now. Float is high with about 1.6B shares out there. However today's volume at the time of writing is over 415M. That's not bad given such a high float. It's about 200% more than the average volume. 

The options chain on $SNDL has me giddy. With over 200,000 options currently in the money on todays move above $1 there is some high potential here for some interesting action. The put to call ratio is just obnoxiously low at .08 it's screaming upwards betting. If we hold above $1 the potential squeeze up could be amazing.   


It's also broken up on the trend lines and out of the downward channel it was in. The regression channel from the peak squeeze back in Feb just broke out today according to my crayons I have laying around. 

$TLRY

$TLRY was the squeeze of a lifetime if you remember it back in 19'. The ticker was just a money printer with it's low float and stupid hype. Then they proceeded to do, like they all do, and issue debt. Shares tumbled since then falling from $120 --> $5. Ouch bag holders.   


Like all the cannabis stocks the Feb bump pushed $TLRY to above $60 in an amazing move. $TLRY has a lower short interest than $SNDL, but it also has a much lower float at about 300M. Compared to $SNDL the volume here isn't as good, but still remains decently above the avg volume around 36M as of right now. 

If we peep the options chain we also see a crazy low P/C ratio around .11. But we don't have the Open Interest in the chain like $SNDL does unless you roll out to Jun 18. Then we finally get some decent OI.   


Personally I am going with $SNDL. The option's chain looks better, the stock is cheaper, and the short interest is a little better. My advice would be to roll out till at least the Jun 11th $1 strike to not get eaten alive by Theta and IV crush. But WSB does what WSB wants and that's why I love you all.   
Do not go above the $2 strikes IMO. You will get crushed by theta unless we get an insane move, which could happen but I don't see the risk / reward there.",Discussion,0.91

**Some Basic Information**

* Rite Aid has only 55 million shares outstanding. Of those, approximately 57.75% are held by institutions and insiders.
* There are 7,860,000 million shares short or about 14.3% of the total outstanding shares. Those familiar with RAD know that it has been a target of short sellers for years who have tried desperately (but failed) to push the company into bankruptcy.
* The company had annual revenue of $24 Billion last year and is projected to hit $25 Billion this year.
* Despite having $24 - $25 Billion in annual revenue, Rite Aid's market cap is barely above $1 Billion.
* The stock price broke above $20 per share on June 2, 2021. The 2021 high share price thus far is $32.48, achieved back in January.
* The company is expected to turn the corner this year and report positive net earnings for the full fiscal year.
* The long-term debt is approximately $3.1 Billion
* Rite Aid achieved positive free cash flow last year and will do so again this year.
* Earlier this year, RAD completed an acquisition of Bartell Drugs for just under $100 Million, making Rite Aid the #1 pharmacy in Seattle.
* Rite Aid is the #3 retail pharmacy in the USA behind CVS and Walgreens.
* In 2018, Walgreens acquired 1,923 Rite Aid stores for $4.4 billion in cash. Rite Aid now has more than 2,500 retail stores today.
* Some analysis done on Rite Aid has projected that the breakup value of the company is in the range of $39 - $50 per share. (example - [https://www.reddit.com/r/RiteAidInvestor\_RAD/comments/m7haju/rite\_aid\_no\_matter\_how\_you\_cut\_it\_it\_is\_the\_right/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RiteAidInvestor_RAD/comments/m7haju/rite_aid_no_matter_how_you_cut_it_it_is_the_right/) )

**Impact of Coronavirus Vaccination Program and Future Contribution of Other Vaccines**

One significant contributor to Rite Aid‚Äôs financial improvement on the current fiscal year results will be the coronavirus vaccine distribution program. Rite Aid is an official participant in the US government‚Äôs Federal Retail Pharmacy Program for COVID-19 Vaccination. The US government dramatically increased the reimbursement rates for pharmacies administering the coronavirus vaccine to $40 from $28 for a single dose.

At the rate of vaccination projected, it is fair to estimate that Rite Aid will administer approximately six (6) million doses of COVID-19 vaccine during the first half of its 2022 fiscal year alone. Using the government reimbursement rates, the six (6) million doses will likely generate $230 million in revenue for Rite Aid and contribute approximately $2 per share in net profits. While the initial vaccination program will likely be completed during Rite Aid‚Äôs fiscal first half, the COVID-19 vaccine boosters are likely to become an annual revenue / profit stream for Rite Aid, as the annual flu vaccine is today. The latest view from epidemiologists suggests that annual coronavirus booster shots will likely be required on an annual basis. The global spread of coronavirus variants such as the E484K mutation lend credence to this view. Furthermore, customers visiting their local Rite Aid for COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters will become aware and take advantage of the fact that the retailer also offers nineteen (19) other vaccines, including flu, pneumonia, chicken pox, HPV, hepatitis A & B, and meningitis among others. As a result, vaccine distribution will continue to play a role in Rite Aids retail pharmacy growth story.

Finally, with the rapid development of mRNA vaccine technology to address the COVID-19 pandemic, we can expect to see new vaccines hit the market to prevent a variety of different types of cancers and other life-threatenting / chronic diseases. Such vaccines would be added to the list administered by pharmacists at local retail stores such as Rite Aid, increasing the revenue and profit potential of such establishments.

**Potential for RAD to Be Acquired**

While Amazon is often mentioned as a suitor for Rite Aid, I actually believe that the highest probability of a buyout of Rite Aid would come from Walmart.

Walmart is already a leading player in the retail pharmacy / prescription drug segment, and the category is a strategic growth target for the company. However, Walmart has nowhere near the presence in the pharmacy sector of either CVS or Walgreens. In order for Walmart to become competitive in this space, they have to increase their size and scale. If Walmart let's Amazon step up and become the third largest player in retail pharmacy, it's game over. WMT needs to move into this third position and block AMZN from doing so.

A couple of the benefits of Walmart acquiring Rite Aid would be:

* Walmart would have double the purchasing power for prescriptions thereby lowering its overall drug cost, improving profitability
* All the goods sold in the front-end of the 2,500+ Rite Aid retail pharmacies are the same products Walmart sells in its own department stores. Once again, when you buy larger quantities you get lower prices. This is a fact of the business world that I know first hand.

Based on the above 2 points, Walmart would improve both its own existing margins and at the same time would improve those of the Rite Aid revenue through such an acquisition.

The Rite Aid PBM would help Walmart to capture much greater market share in the prescription market, thereby enhaning those gains even further.

If you look at Walgreens and CVS when they had approximately $25 - $30 billion in revenue, they were earning about $4 - 6 billion per year. Therefore, considering Walmarts expertise in running brick and mortar establishments, one could make the leap of logic that WMT would achieve similar profit levels. So an acquisition of RAD by Walmart essentially provides a 2-3 year payback on the investment.

**Conclusion - Potential for Share Price to Soar Higher this Summer**

Rite Aid is due to report its Q1 earnings for the current fiscal year on June 24, 2021. The stock is likely to rally back to its 2021 high of $32.48 as that date approaches.

Also, as meme stocks continue to soar higher, Rite Aid is likely to benefit from such market activity as well. With only 55 million shares outstanding, RAD could easily see an exponential run higher should retail investors once again take an interest in this former WSB favorite.

268,GME,nnpn9z,2021-05-29 17:21:20,AMC &amp; GME Price Action Comparison before their squeeze,"What's going on y'all

&#x200B;

Just want to share some charts and information that I noticed while comparing AMC and GME before the squeeze

&#x200B;

So as you all know, this past week has been one for the books for AMC, from it's low on Monday, May 24th we witnessed an increase of 201% on AMC. Now this got me thinking and made me want to look back at the history of how GME started to move before it's squeeze.

&#x200B;

If you look at the candles closely, they are very very alot alike

&#x200B;

1. GME's breakout candle, on Thursday, January 13th and AMC's breakout candle, on Wednesday, May 13th are almost identical
2. After both breakouts, they traded above the bollinger bands for 3 back to back sessions
3. After GME's breakout, we saw a consolidation of price action for 5 trading sessions
4. After AMC's breakout we saw a consolidation of price action for 7 trading sessions
5. From GME's low on it's initial breakout to it's high the Friday before the squeeze, we saw on increase of 283%
6. From AMC's low on it's initial breakout to it's high the Friday before the potential squeeze, we saw an increase of 245%

&#x200B;

This is where things get interesting...

&#x200B;

The bullish candle that was formed for GME on Friday, January 22nd looks ALOT like the bullish candle formed on Thursday, May 27th for AMC

The spinning top candle that was formed for GME on Monday, Jan 25th looks alot like the spinning top candle formed on Friday, May 28th for AMC

&#x200B;

Taking into consideration the market is closed on memorial day, is this history repeating itself? If it is, that would mean the squeeze will start next week? Now I don't want to attach certain dates, I'm just sharing more information with you all. You be the judge of it.

Entry point is as important as exit. RKT is trading at a generous $22.30 in AH action. It's still under it's price-point pre-earnings calls and far below the all-time-high of $43 (technically $48 as it hit that in AH trading). Some quick facts:

* RKT option calls are still cheap (IV is at reasonable levels)
* Option chain goes up to $58.89
* Last time RKT rocketed up, it went right to the top of the option chain
* Lots of potential tendies to be made, for example, $1,750 worth of $30 contracts could be worth $140K if it goes up to the top of the option chain ($58.89)
* Even buying shares can potentially lead to a nice 2.64x mutliple on your investment!

Why now?

* Bullish pattern in today's trading and is up 20% this week
* It's trading pattern has been independant of other meme stocks, suggesting a potential break out
* Positive retail sentiment = It's in the top 10 trending stocks on stocktwits
* It's close to an inclusion in the S&P 500 (Check this [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nsanas/rkt_is_nearly_in_the_sp_500_did_some_research_and/) for more info)

Not to mention that RKT is fundamentally undervalued!

* Profitable each quarter
* P/E ratio of 4.8 vs 30+ for high growth companies in S&P 500
* Dominant market position and insulated against interest rates because they are a workflow platform for brokers and therefore earnings are based more on the number of brokers on their platform rather than other metrics for traditional mortgage companies

That being said he had already outlined the test schedule in the earnings zoom call.

1st test flight - may 
2nd crewed flight - June 
3rd flight with R Branson on board late June/July 

4th flight this will be taking the Italian airforce on a training mission (600k a seat) late July


On the run in to the first test flight some possible maintenance issues appeared with the carrier plane White knight 2‚Ä¶. 
This indeed could have gone either way , after 2 weeks inspections it was decided that WK2 did not need to delay testing no maintenance was needed at this point. Scheduled Maintenance will commence in the fall after all tests have been completed.
Upon this news it is my opinion that the testing programme will go ahead as planned.

The market has responded accordingly and the stock is now up from $17-‚Ç¨31

With all these catalysts lined up before the end of the year and commercial operations looming for early 2022 things are looking up for Virgin Galactic.The success of the last test flight the company have now proven tech and concept.

Both GME and AMC were hugely shorted previously when the rallies started, and now that short interest has decreased. It still is there but has decreased and that's why I think we've seen momentum change.

Today, AMC took a massive hit due to the company offering nearly 12 million stocks for purchase which hurt many peoples wins and likely some that hasn't invested sooner. 
Edit: this above paragraph apparently is inaccurate, it was misinformation posted on a news article today that was misleading. Apparently there was no selloff.
Edit 2: renig here. Apparently it is confirmed that the 11.5millipn shares were selling today, which naturally would've contributed to the amc sell off. Multiple news outlets I've found state the same not referencing any April date. This is a discussion post. This is the most up to date and accurate info I can seem to find.

I expect GME and AMC will likely both continue to increase if stocks are held. But based on short interest alone, it would seem to me that WKHS is next in line for the biggest squeeze meaning it has the biggest short term gains to be had.

WKHS was trading for around $10-$11 yesterday and is nearly $15/share currently.

286,LNG,nt8spt,2021-06-06 01:56:31,Tellurian $Tell annual shareholder meeting this week and likely third deal announcement that could kick off Stage 1 LNG Export project construction! This is going to be a huge value play!! üìà,"I was updating my original DD post this evening. ([Original DD Link for reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/TellurianLNG/comments/l8aspr/tellurian_tell_long_term_investment_outlook_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) After doing the math, if we have deals with similar terms such as Souki mentioned, we need one more to hit the Stage 1 benchmark. Each of the recent deals is for 3 mtpa marketing takeoff. *We have a gap of 2.5 mtpa assuming Total sticks with their agreement terms or modify's slightly as the expectation was FID by June 2021.*

One deal released a week for three weeks, leading up to the annual shareholder meeting next week. It's perfect execution on PR leading up to an all-out celebration by the leadership team. Souki can give the üñï to the shorts, Total for selling part of their shares, and get started with construction this summer to build out the local infrastructure, FID, and then NTP (notice to proceed) in Q1 2022 with Bechtel. üí∞

I believe the next deal will be with Korea Gas Corporation (KOGAS) or Sinopec.

KOGAS has the lion's share on their market and recent tweets about South Korea, Tell CEO being appointed to South Korea / USA business council. [https://mobile.twitter.com/TellurianLNG/status/1396127896939515906](https://mobile.twitter.com/TellurianLNG/status/1396127896939515906)

Sinopec recently signed their first long-term LNG contract with Qatar Petroleum for 2 mtpa. They're actively looking to secure future energy needs.  Let's do 2.5 or 3 mtpa with Tellurian and USA to have a larger contract than Qutar.  'Murica.

**Driftwood Project Stages**

|Stage|Plants|Capacity in mtpa|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Stage 1|Plants 1 & 2|11.0|
|Stage 2|Plant 3|5.5|
|Stage 3|Plant 4|5.5|
|Stage 4|Plant 5|5.5|
|Total||27.6|

SNK‚Äôs comment brings a great perspective on takeoff with Souki‚Äôs comments on mtpa being greater than Stage 1 alone. The overflow would start conversations about Stage 2. Construction of plants 1, 2, 3  could begin together.

&#x200B;

|Project Capacity|Percent of Assets|mtpa|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Original - Tellurian|40%|12|
|Original - Equity Partners|60%|15.6|
|Likely - Tellurian|58%|16|
|Likely - Equity Partners|42%|11.5|

&#x200B;

|Partnerships|Contract Type|Capacity in mtpa|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Total|Equity partner|1|
|Total|Marketing|1.5|
|Gunvor|Marketing|3|
|Vitol|Marketing|3|
|Total as of 6/4||8.5|
|Required for Stage 1||\-11|
|Remaining as of 6/4||\-2.5|

&#x200B;

Operating Costs on FOB (free on board) forecasts were mentioned around $3.50 to the water if I recall, which could be based on the project financing provided upfront through equity partners. Since the majority of the deals are from the marketing offtake, I assume the financing for Stage 1 will need to be secured by Tellurian via loans or infrastructure programs. This self-financing could put operating costs near $4.50 mark.

Project finance could be sourced by having a foundation of long-term take contracts with investment-grade partners. They list the credit rating of parties. With the recent infrastructure bill and the government's attempts at direct access to the bond market, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if bond issuance or infrastructure funds was part of the equation. Project partners such as GE or Bechtel could step up in agreements to provide sourcing. The majority would be bank debt. I hope stock issuance isn't the route taken.

Driftwood Stage 1 EPC contract costs $700 per ton. Lifted to $710 to adjust for market changes in 2019. I believe 1-2% lift is an understatement with current supply cost changes. I've seen a 5% rise in labor costs alone in 2020/2021 in my industry. Short term I would push closer to the 14% rise. That would be $98. This rise might not last the entire duration of phase 1 construction. I'll guesstimate $45. $745 per ton.

|Operating Costs|$/mmBtu|
|:-|:-|
|Drilling & completion|$0.88|
|Operating|$0.36|
|Gathering, processing & transportation|$0.79|
|Contingency|$0.22|
|Liquefaction|$0.75|
|Debt|$1.50|
|Total FOB|$4.50|

**Price Targets**

$1 just in asset valuation - Acquisition of Magellan Petroleum Corporation (Haynesville Gas Production Well) is valued $400M.

2021 - March/July = $4-$10 - Deals announced gap-up (3B valuation / 409M shares). $7.34

2021 - September or FID announced = $12 - 5B in capital in (5B valuation / 409M shares) $12.22

2024 = $37 at Stage 1 Project completion (15B in valuation / 409M shares).

2025/2026/Mid-decade will see a peak in Demand/Supply pricing where LNG company's valuations could get frothy.

Future: 40% capacity equals $70 a share

Future: 100% capacity equals $120 a share

Max would be 100B valuation / 409M shares at $245. Equity partners could comprise 60% of equity that would eat into total available shares.

Dear retards,

Today  I was doing my DD‚Äôs and while doing my wacc, roe and other bullshit  analysis I had the smart idea to have a look at the Short Interest of  sndl.

While looking at it I was  astonished by the data reported by Bloomberg terminal. Our  short-interest ratio is 1.44, while amc is only 0.53 and gme 1.45  (source: Bloomberg terminal).

This means that the number of shorted shares is 1.44 times higher than the average trading volume which is absolutely crazy!!!!

The  percentage of the float is around 15%, however, the data of float  percentage has not been updated yet. IMO we could easily be at around  20, as gme and amc.

The main thing differentiating us from AMC and GME is the SI Score provided by Bloomberg terminal √† 2nd

amc is just 5th whereas gme 4th

To conclude the S3 rate temperature, indicating the seasoned financing levels with 1, 50 or 100

1= Liquid borrows typically indicating a short interest at or below historic terms

50= Marginally higher borrow levels typically indicating somewhat elevated short interest

100= Increased borrow levels typically indicating elevated short interest.

We  are currently at 50, ( gme stands at 1 (source Bloomberg terminal)) and  even in this case, the data have not yet been updated from the previous  month‚Ä¶.

The SQUEEZE is near we all need to hold sundial !!!!

Cheers and have a good day y‚Äôall degenerates

P.S. This is not a financial advice, I‚Äôm just posting for fun and for educational purpose. Have a good day and make DD‚Äôs :)

318,BB,ntf8df,2021-06-06 08:16:40,$BB ideas for Monday,"Disclaimer: I got out from $BB on Friday.

$BB dropped below $14.30 (50% Fib Retracement mark). This mark was tested and rejected multiple time from Thursday through Friday. However at around 2pm $BB dropped bellow. Bulls immediately tried regaining this level but got rejected and we closed below. The next level is 61.8%, $13. Bulls must hold this one in my opinion. There's a big hole that is still unfilled when $BB gapped up from June 1st to 2nd. If $BB goes below $13, then we might retest June 1st closing of $11.56 and 78.6% retracement mark of $11.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/Pv2AQcyz/

Volume on Friday also wasn't great. Comparing it to Thursday is a bit unfair since that was a record breaking day. That being said, Friday volume was a half of what it was on Wednesday. This was also $BBs first negative day of this run. Looking back to January, first negative day of that run also coincided with lower volume and that was basically the end of that run. Volume was keep decreasing since that day going forward. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/onHdg7BE/

On Monday:

* If $BB opens above $14.30, it will most likely try and retest 50% retracement again. If we hold above, might be a good place to jump back in. 

* If $BB opens between $14.30 and $13, just wait and see, that's noman's land. If $BB starts to slide then I'm looking for a strong rejection at $13 before even thinking about jumping back in. If we go below $13, then there are good chances we'll retest $11.5 and $11 marks. If $BB starts the morning strong and goes up, watch what happens at $14.30. Going above and stabilizing that is a good sign. 
* And of course I'm looking for better volume than last Friday if there's to be continuation of this run.",DD,0.79

Things in SPCE's favor

1. Today's flight was the first from the new Space Port America....the long term operational home
2. Paid flight with [Italian Air Force](https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-and-italian-air-force-announce-world-first-government-contract-for-human-tended-research-flight/) is still on the schedule for 2022
3. Sir Richard's maiden voyage will like now take place THIS YEAR, lowering the concerns for other eccentric billionaires to go for a joy ride
4. There are at least [8,000 flights](https://www.manufacturing.net/aerospace/news/21118425/virgin-galactic-8000-have-placed-space-flight-reservation) already reserved which equals at least $2B (8,000x 250,000) in locked in future revenue, and the assumption is that if commercial flights start in 2022, new bookings will start much higher up

I  have shared my thoughts on UWMC in past. The company announced Q1  earnings and while they look like they are below expectations it was  explained by the CEO that because of the speed of their execution, their  results are reflective of the higher rate environment already while  competitors are lagged.

During    the Q4 2020 earnings call he  had mused about options that would be on    the stable, special dividend,  buyback or raising the dividend.

**Feb Q4 Earnings Quote:**

The     Board did approve a dividend, a $0.10 quarterly dividend to be  paid    on  April 6 for all shareholders of record as of March 10. **We expect  this to be a regular quarterly dividend**.

And     so you guys know how we're thinking about this. Our balance sheet   is  a   fortress. And our current liquidity position is very strong, and    we   have access to the capital markets as well. The way we think  about   this   going forward is we're producing a lot of cash. We're  going to   maybe   be more profitable than some expected and be very  successful in   2021.   And **if we have excess cash that I and the Board deem is too much,  we will be delivering that back**. And whether we have to **change     the  dividend in the future, as in raise it or a special dividend,     those  things are definitely on the table or even buying back shares**.

**May Q1 Earnings Quote:**

As     you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of      $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a      record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I always  **explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special  dividend or a share buyback program**. As you guys have seen, we **concluded      share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward   shareholders.    We announced the authorization of $300 million share   buyback over the    next 24 months**.  And **quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that**.

**Then in answering a question from an analyst**

Doug    Harter -  Great. And then just in terms of capital return, you    mentioned sort of  the float. I  guess just how are you thinking about    kind of **how much of  the float  you'd be willing to take out and pacing around share  repurchase**?

Mat Ishbia -  Yes, Doug. So I'm learning these rules as we go **because at this stock  price, I'm a buyer, right**?    And so we'll buy shares as soon as tomorrow, I  think, as our legal    teams say we're allowed to do. And so I don't know  how many I can buy    and what I can do, but I'm very conscientious of the  float.  If the    float was not a concern, **we'd be more aggressive**. However,  **we     have authorization from the Board to buy up to $300 million, and I'm      going to take advantage of that opportunity while being  conscientious     of our partners in the float.**

TL/DR:     UWMC and their board have been looking at ways to give back to     shareholders. Instead of a short term cash out, they decided on a     buyback that they are planning to exercise immediately on so that they     can retire shares while the SP is low. They will NOT buy so much that   it   will ruin their float % for Russell. The CEO is aggressive, has    approval to spend $300 and he's going to take FULL advantage.  The CEO has stated he is a BUYER! They are  not   waiting, it's being deployed now.

Disclosure I am still in long position with 25K  at 8.39 USD shares of UWMC

**EMA (Exponential Moving Average) significance:**

EMAs are one of my favorite indicators that I use to follow ""trends"" of a stock. It is darn near impossible to predict EXACT dates, prices, etc.. but EMA's allow a trader to notice trends and possible reversals. All stocks have a tendency to deviate toward the mean whether it is a crazy upward advance or sell off, and then will draw closer to the mean eventually. And in this case after a huge run up like that the price will settle a bit but as long as it stays above the EMA it will continue up. The stock has been above the 55 EMA on the 15 min chart since $12.44 and if it fights to get back above which it looks to be doing then I am seeing an upward to continuation (hopefully). But remember I am smooth brained, this is not financial advice.

Black berry‚Äôs forward revenue will be dominated by two things. Cylance, their cyber security software, and IVY and QNX, their vehicle data hub. Let‚Äôs start with IVY and QNX

QNX is a software for vehicles to compartmentalize all their software and data. It‚Äôs essentially an operating system for smart cars. It is currently in 175 million vehicles, with more being added every day. Any company without proprietary software (almost all of them besides Tesla) rely on QNX to run their cars‚Äô software 

IVY is a software that reads and organizes vehicle sensor data being picked up by QNX. This is a software in the process of being rolled out, that will create the early stages of a third party self driving solution for any car company without a proprietary self driving software (almost all of them besides Tesla.) With neural networks, which are what are used to make cars self drive, data is king, and you need a lot of it. It will not be an easy thing for car companies to build themselves. And when it comes time to compete with Tesla‚Äôs self driving cars, they‚Äôll all be clamoring for IVY

Cylance - Blackberry Cylance is an AI driven anti virus software. It‚Äôs confusing, but the gist is that there are many variations of the same virus, most being one time use and have never been seen before, and AI anti virus is needed to detect and stop all the variations. Cylance has been able to stop the attack used by dark side, the hack that brought down the colonial pipeline, since 2015

Deep Fucking Value - black berry is currently trading with a market cap of 4.8 billion dollars. It‚Äôs cash on hand is $739 million. Bringing the market cap to $4 billion. It also has 38,000 patents, some of which are in the process of being sold to Facebook for potentially 1-2 billion dollars. On the low end of these patent sales, this puts the market cap at $3 billion.

That‚Äôs $3 billion dollars for a key cog in the self driving pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) a key cog in the smart car pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) and a key player in the cyber security industry (a $250 billion dollar industry)

This stock is a deep fucking value",DD,0.8

346,AMC,nnpn9z,2021-05-29 17:21:20,AMC &amp; GME Price Action Comparison before their squeeze,"What's going on y'all

&#x200B;

Just want to share some charts and information that I noticed while comparing AMC and GME before the squeeze

&#x200B;

So as you all know, this past week has been one for the books for AMC, from it's low on Monday, May 24th we witnessed an increase of 201% on AMC. Now this got me thinking and made me want to look back at the history of how GME started to move before it's squeeze.

&#x200B;

If you look at the candles closely, they are very very alot alike

&#x200B;

1. GME's breakout candle, on Thursday, January 13th and AMC's breakout candle, on Wednesday, May 13th are almost identical
2. After both breakouts, they traded above the bollinger bands for 3 back to back sessions
3. After GME's breakout, we saw a consolidation of price action for 5 trading sessions
4. After AMC's breakout we saw a consolidation of price action for 7 trading sessions
5. From GME's low on it's initial breakout to it's high the Friday before the squeeze, we saw on increase of 283%
6. From AMC's low on it's initial breakout to it's high the Friday before the potential squeeze, we saw an increase of 245%

&#x200B;

This is where things get interesting...

&#x200B;

The bullish candle that was formed for GME on Friday, January 22nd looks ALOT like the bullish candle formed on Thursday, May 27th for AMC

The spinning top candle that was formed for GME on Monday, Jan 25th looks alot like the spinning top candle formed on Friday, May 28th for AMC

&#x200B;

Taking into consideration the market is closed on memorial day, is this history repeating itself? If it is, that would mean the squeeze will start next week? Now I don't want to attach certain dates, I'm just sharing more information with you all. You be the judge of it.

350,AMC,nw04kf,2021-06-09 18:35:01,$CLOV showing a similar pattern as $AMC and $CLOV prediction for this week,"Pattern:

I've been patient with AMC in the last of couple days with over $100k invested @$19. I'm starting see a familiar pattern with CLOV. I see a similar pattern with AMC's second day of rise and CLOV's behavior today. With an initial spike, both of these stocks all started with a high pre-market price and a cooldown throughout the day. Eventually, AMC showed this pattern for a day or two until it shot up for the last time before the short squeeze began. CLOV is still at an infant phase of a massive potential squeeze. The shorts are putting on pressure to keep CLOV low, but the counter pressure from retail investors are holding the stock and not give into the panic. Holding the line for a day or two will accumulate more retail investors, who are buying these dips. If CLOV is the next short squeeze play, it will surpass AMC in a heartbeat.

Prediction:

CLOV is a gamble play for sure. There is always a probability of short squeeze happening depending on many factors, like media and sentiment. However, CLOV was my next pick because the numbers showed me that it definitely had a massive squeeze potential, and I saw a familiar resemblance with AMC. High risk high reward.

If CLOV plays out like how AMC did, CLOV will close today with the resistance around $17\~$18 range. The next morning, CLOV will see a massive spike during the pre-market and cooling off for a bit throughout the day. Then CLOV would've stabilized around $20 and the shorts will start to get impatient. They will have to cover their shorts because they are not seeing CLOV going down anywhere close to $7\~8 again in the next couple of days. Thus, the short squeeze will begin. Once it begins, more retail investors will join in. With the options expiring on the 18th, more people will join in seeing a potential gamma squeeze. I can see this stock go to an unimaginable numbers if the pattern continues. 

This is a domino effect play. The first step has to be completed before moving onto the next. I believe that the first step is already completed, and we are at the second step, fighting against bearish sentiment. Third step is the squeeze. Fourth step is wait for the squeeze to stabilize, and the last step is to cash out the profit.

This is purely my personal opinions and not a financial advice. Seeing how big the wallstreetbets community is, a pattern like this is likely to happen again. At the end of the day, retail investors don't change their behaviors over night because we are not under any management or any strategy. The pattern will repeat.",Discussion,0.72

So, as a long term growth stock I can understand since it's moving towards being a software company. What I am not understanding is the **short term** play that everyone is trying to get in on and am misunderstanding something?

If the stock was shorted at 10% of the float (55m) as of yesterday and saw the premarket jump from 15.25 to 20.04 with 30mil of volume then drops to 16.4 with no resistance, wouldn't that indicate whoever short sold prior to 6/3 likely covered in the premarket?As the price has been steadily dropping through out the week, wouldn't new short positions indicated by daily short ratio increasing likely transitory and also likely to have been covering within the high volume as it trends down throughout the day?The short borrow fee rate is currently at 0.41% which means if a short seller didn't cover within the past few days, couldn't they just wait it out as it costs so little?Some one mentioned in the other thread that it could gamma squeeze but looking at the OI for next week, the open interest from $13 and 18.50 strike is only 4.6m shares which makes up like 1% of the float.

Actually, AMC was my inspiration for looking deeper into the GME chart - it had/has a **fantastic setup**.

Broke a massive falling wedge on the daily chart with a great increase in volume. It's also a cup and handle dating back to January. There was even confluence with key resistance near the breakout point @ **11.58.**

**13.24** is key support now, keep an eye on that.

We have been coiling under key resistance for a few days (**14.53) THE SECOND THIS BREAKS, WE ARE CLEAR FOR TAKEOFF (AGAIN).** Also - note the way we are coiling upwards below key resistance is a very bullish data point. Volume is declining as we chop up.

Price targets are **17.25 & 20.36.**

This is the best setup I've seen in this stock since the initial squeeze. Remember, keep it simple.

***TL;DR -*** AMC actually looks good for once from an **unbiased** technical standpoint

In case you're looking for some deeper DD, I suggest you check out the other [BCRX DD article](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mtzhp2/bcrx_dd_the_embarrassment_of_riches/) I wrote.

&#x200B;

* **2021 Q1 ER Beat**

On May the 6th, 2021 BCRX presented Q1 Earnings Report data which managed  ***Beat Analysts estimates***. Basically what matters from this ***Q1 ER*** is that it was the ***launch of Orladeyo***, and Analysts wanted to see a decent amount of money generated by it. They were expecting Orladeyo sales to top ***$3.1MM*** and Orladeyo actually generated ***$10.94MM***, this is a ***353% sales beat***

https://preview.redd.it/uppmf8dy09z61.png?width=765&format=png&auto=webp&s=7215a9fc3d12ae2ead2bb782802742ef8ab998cb

The consequence of the ER beat was an increase of **24.06%** in the **SP**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It's *really important* to mention that **revenues generated this Q1** only came from the **USA**.

This **Q2 Orladeyo** has been **approved in Japan/Europe/UK** aswell, adding new sources of revenue.

&#x200B;

**Orladeyo sales** are expected to **grow exponentially** **each quarter**. Main reason for it is that it has been approved in the countries mentioned above. The other reason is that the amount of **patients** they treat will **slowly score up** as **insurance companies allow** their clients to be treated with this drug.

&#x200B;

The data displayed below shows the amount of patients using Orladeyo in 3 or 4 pharmacies which provide information to Bloomberg. This numbers help us track how Orladeyo's sales evolve, but it's not 100% accurate.

&#x200B;

If we sum up the numbers from Q1 we get a total of 43 patients, in the first month of Q2 there are 38 new patients already. Meaning Orladeyo nearly managed to get in a single month all the amount of patients it gathered in Q1, **reasuring the exponential growth.** This numbers will keep rising now that Orladeyo is approved in more countries.

The fact ***Orladeyo*** is ***taken*** ***orally it's huge.*** Back then before ***Oral Orladeyo*** was approved for HAE, ***patients*** would only have treatments that required usage of ***needles,*** there were ***no other oral treatments approved to treat HAE***.

In the USA there currently are 10,000 patients, ***7500 diagnosed and treated,*** 1700 diagnosed but not treated, 600 treated but not diagnosed.

Physicians expect to prescribe ***Orladeyo for over 41% of HAE patients***. Conservatively thinking, taking 7,500 patients ( the diagnosed and treated ones ) out of the total 10,000 pool in the USA, with over[ 41% of patients prescription](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) ( page 16 ) we would conservatively aim for ***3,075 patients.***

The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in the USA, is equal to ***485,000$***

&#x200B;

**Japan**

On November the 5th Biocryst undergone an agreement with ***Torii Pharmaceuticals.*** A local Japanese company that will be in charge of getting new patients to be treated with Orladeyo in Japan and commerzialing it.

Japan has around 2,500 HAE patients, and Biocryst conservatively expects to ***at*** ***least reach 500 patients.***

The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in Japan, is equal to ***$248,500***

***Approval of Orladeyo in Japan issued a $15MM milestone payment*** from Torii.

***BioCryst will receive*** tiered royalties ranging from ***20% - 40% of Japanese sales.***

&#x200B;

**Europe**

It's estimated to be around ***12,000 HAE patients in Europe.*** Following the physician prescription of over[ 41% of patients to prescribe](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 16) for Orladeyo. We get a total of ***4,920 patients*** in Europe.

Since pricings and jurisdictions work in a different way in Europe, the amount of money each patient will have to pay for Orladeyo is expected to be around or above Japan's ***$248,500/year.*** This number should soon be confirmed.

&#x200B;

**United Kingdom**

It's estimated there are **1500-2000 HAE** patients in there, **1000 of them diagnosed**. Following the physician prescription of over[ 41% of patients to prescribe](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 16) for Orladeyo we should expect to capture 400 patients.

Orladeyo price in UK is expected to be similar to the one in Japan \~ ***$248,500/year***. meaning **$99,400,000** revenue with 400 patients.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

With this yearly prices and the amount of patients defined before, we get the following results.

\- ***USA - 3,075p x 485K = 1,491,375,000$***

\- ***Japan - 500p x 248,5K = 124,250,000$***

**- UK - 400p x 248,5K = 99,400,000$**

Summing it all up we get $2,850,670,000. From that number we have to subtract 123,100,000$ making it a total of ***$2,727,570,000***. The sustraction happens as a result of the undergone Royalty agreement with Torii Pharmaceuticals and Royalty Pharma.

Having in mind the discussed numbers before, Orladeyo alone will be generating ***$2,727,570,000*** a year, using the average mid-cap Biotech company multiplier **x7**. We get a total of ***$19,092,990,000*** meaning an increase of ***$104,46*** in the stock price. 108.41

* **Conclusion**

We are just about to witness how ***BCRX evolves*** from being an R&D company, to be a commercial stage one. This will mainly happen due to the ***revenue generated by Orladeyo*** and the ***potential of BCX9930.***

Basically from now on ***each ER will be a new catalyst for BCRX.*** Considering how Orladeyo is still in an early launch state the revenue it generates will exponentially keep growing, so will the SP.

***Orladeyo*** undoubtly is an awesome asset for BCRX, a ***cash-cow***. But the one drug in BCRX's pipeline that has the ***most promising future is BCX9930***. An Oral inhibitor in PH3 pivotal studies which treats ***8 different diseases*** as of now, aimming for a potential ***40B market size by 2025***. Deeper information about it can be found in the following article [BCRX - The Embarrassment of Riches](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mtzhp2/bcrx_dd_the_embarrassment_of_riches/).

I currently do have a position in this company, my average entry price being around the 4$ range. In my opinion BCRX probably has the **best risk/reward ratio in the bio-world** and I do not plan to sell my shares yet.",DD,0.81

All our favorite stocks in GME, AMC, BB, CLNE, CLOV, WKHS are spiking and it's a retard's dream come true.  Only problem is that we seem to be a bit scattered currently with almost 7 different tickers being mentioned over and over again.  Let's get straight to the point, we want to make money.  (By the way I'm not a financial advisor and anyone that takes advice from me is probably retarded).  Out of all the meme stocks, one stands out the most to me just because of fundamentals alone:



**CLNE.**



Now don't get me wrong, there's another certain stock that has to do with videogames which is shorted to oblivion and hedgies are absolutely fucked.  But we're talking about Mr. Clean right now.  



**How can this cow fart meme stock make me money you ask?** 



Well, it's the only one with the government on our side.  Mr. Biden is all about going green in the future and what better feel good story than turning cow fart into a natural gas that powers our vehicles?  This crazy company actually devised a way to transition their product from traditional CNG or LNG to something they call ""Renewable Natural Gas"" (RNG).  



**So how the fuck are they doing this??**



Let me explain.  The landfills, wastewater treatment facilities, ranches etc. create methane. They use some of it to power their facilities, but then are left with a fuck ton of leftover methane which, until CLNE came around, they would just burn off into the environment at a GWP of 30. And that's not a good number for us.  But our hero and savior CLNE takes the methane that's captured it and processes it into RNG, which they then transport to filling stations and use to fill up heavy transport vehicles. Those vehicles emit 1.1 GWP carbon, making them, technically, carbon negative.  And who eats this shit up??  Amazon.  Amazon recently created a pilot program by which they are buying 1,000 RNG powered vehicles for their fleet. CLNE did something brilliant a few years ago to put themselves in the position to be the ones who fuel these machines by building their refilling stations right next to Amazon's warehouses.  Not only that but Amazon will be buying 53 million shares at a strike price of $13.49 by the end of the decade from CLNE.  


[Source](https://investors.cleanenergyfuels.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clean-energy-signs-agreement-amazon-low-and-negative-carbon-rng)  



**Price**



The stock is currently trading around $10 because IB wants to keep it under $13 for the time being.  I'm sure you guys have read the gamma squeeze potential coming up on 6/18 so I'm not going to go too deep into that.  Basically if $CLNE hits $13 by June 18th, over 1.86 million shares become in the money for calls. And another 400,000 shares at 12, and 280,000 at 11, and 390,000 at 10.  The 5 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for Clean Energy Fuels Corp have a median target of 20.00, with a high estimate of 27.00 and a low estimate of 11.00  


[Source](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=CLNE)



It's a company that's easily worth at least double what it's trading at right now but because of the small float it's pretty easy to manipulate.  The IB's are fighting like hell to keep the price at 12.99 or lower which can be seen even in last week's last trading days where out of the total volume on Friday, 32% have have been sold short and it's an increase from Thursday where only 8% of the volume was sold short.  That kept that spike from $9 to $11 from getting out of control for them.

**The Play?**



Shares.  The small float means that shares can increase the price substantially causing IV to get bigger and makes the setup for the gamma squeeze that much more likely.  And even if you don't play the squeeze at all, this company is still a no brainer in terms of being undervalued currently and I predict to be $20+ by EOY.  



**TL;DR:**  Cow farts go BRRRRRRR.  Super undervalued company that has great potential in the future and actually has the fundamentals to support it.

Possibly I have used some wrong language, I will try to fix that with this post. In any case, this is important news for all AMC holders:

AMC has issued almost all of their shares (they've got only 46,124 shares left). And they will NOT issue any additional shares in 2021, according to them. This is good news, as it can certainly help the stock price to move higher.

They issued some shares today, and raised cash. For the company this is a good thing. They are well capitalized now. They asked for permission to issue 25 Million shares sometimes in 2022 - But we can talk about that when it is important, in 2022 their business could be a 110% again, and issuing new shares won't be necessary anymore.

This is the important part of their statement:

""As of today,  in our efforts to best position AMC for a successful recovery from the  pandemic, we have issued or reserved substantially all but 46,124 of the  shares that were previously authorized. ""

* Bulls need to break 418 and test support. I think we top out at around 420 if 418 support holds.

Entry point is as important as exit. RKT is trading at a generous $22.30 in AH action. It's still under it's price-point pre-earnings calls and far below the all-time-high of $43 (technically $48 as it hit that in AH trading). Some quick facts:

* RKT option calls are still cheap (IV is at reasonable levels)
* Option chain goes up to $58.89
* Last time RKT rocketed up, it went right to the top of the option chain
* Lots of potential tendies to be made, for example, $1,750 worth of $30 contracts could be worth $140K if it goes up to the top of the option chain ($58.89)
* Even buying shares can potentially lead to a nice 2.64x mutliple on your investment!

Why now?

* Bullish pattern in today's trading and is up 20% this week
* It's trading pattern has been independant of other meme stocks, suggesting a potential break out
* Positive retail sentiment = It's in the top 10 trending stocks on stocktwits
* It's close to an inclusion in the S&P 500 (Check this [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nsanas/rkt_is_nearly_in_the_sp_500_did_some_research_and/) for more info)

Not to mention that RKT is fundamentally undervalued!

* Profitable each quarter
* P/E ratio of 4.8 vs 30+ for high growth companies in S&P 500
* Dominant market position and insulated against interest rates because they are a workflow platform for brokers and therefore earnings are based more on the number of brokers on their platform rather than other metrics for traditional mortgage companies

How high can $WISH go?

Pre-market is at $15 with a volume gap and no resistance until $20. From $20 upwards, the path is rockier BUT... We did see a lot of call volume at $20 and even more at $25. So if price reaches and is able to break that higher resistance up to $25, then it's fly high land

If you don't know what Halal is or why this is relevant then you are probably not Muslim or Hindu. The certification will now give BYND a huge customer base boost in my opinion. Impossible Burgers did this in 2018 so the alternative meat market in the UAE has already been introduced. I think BYND is set to capitalize on this new certification especially as meat markets are already negatively impacted from COVID issues.   


$BYND also is sitting >20% short float so any upward movement in this stock could potentially start a quick move up. The stock is sitting near $100 and to me looks to be at a nice floor psychologically ($100 is a nice round bottom for people to buy near).   


Finally the OATLY IPO is coming quick. The alternative meat / protein space will likely be the talk of the town at near the end of the week which may bring BYND up or down with it as the IPO happens. The good ole sympathy trade...   


Disclosure: No I'm not muslim / hindu but I do have family that is. This certification gives them ""confidence"" that during the holidays they can still eat this food. It also allows them to serve this food at events, which is something I know has been an issue in the past for us personally. If it's not Halal it won't be served at a party / event.",Discussion,0.8

‚ÄúUntil further notice, Jefferies Prime Brokerage will no longer offer custody on naked options in GME, AMC and MVIS,‚Äù the memo¬†noted. The firm will no longer allow the execution of short sells of those securities, the memo continued, noting that other stocks may be added to that list.

A Jefferies spokesman declined to comment. Street Insider reported the news earlier, citing an unidentified trader.

The news comes a day after the latest meme stock, AMC, closed at a record high of $62.55 after a 95% gain. The stock was down 5% Thursday at 1:37 p.m. New York time.

440,UWMC,nbkat0,2021-05-13 18:12:36,Why Boomers and Millennials like $UWMC,"Boomers and Millennials agree on little nowadays. One is lazy, doesn't listen, already knows everything, and only thinks about themselves. The other are millennials. But $UWMC is a stock both can buy and hold for short term or long term. Here's why:

**The millennials case for $UWMC:**

Stock Deeply Undervalued: millennials love stocks that hedgies have (allegedly) artificially pushed down the price. UWM is a growing company and Wall Street has positioned itself as if UWM is shrinking.

Share Buybacks: millennials will recognize this buyback is different then say Apple. With $300 million in buybacks, UWM can reduce the whole float by almost 40%.

Option Open Interest: There are 131,934 open interest in options (as of this morning) with strikes at $10 and under. That is a lot of shares that the sellers of those options would need to find. The float could be reduced significantly by share buybacks at that time. Institutional investors easily control 20+million shares and they aren't selling at these prices. Gores holds 15.8m shares they bought for $10 a few months ago.

CEO: Mat is pissed Wall Street doesn't love his company as much as he does. He will do what it takes to get the price to what he needs it to be with the buybacks. He is game to play.

**The boomer case for $UWMC:**

Mortgages: Boomers love mortgages, the bigger the better. UWM is the largest wholesale mortgage provider in America. The mortgage industry isn't going anywhere and boomer's small brains can at least understand that.

Healthy Financials: UWM runs a tight ship and is very profitable. It also trades at a low P/E around 6 or so. Boomers love low P/E's cause they hate tech and tech is ""expensive"". They buy low P/E companies like T cause they are much smarter than millennials at investing.

Dividends: Boomers love dividends. They think it is free money. At a $7.5 stock price $UWMC pays a 5.3% dividend. But even better, UWM pays a dividend on its class A shares only. Class A is only 7% of the outstanding shares, so it costs UWM $42 million to pay a 5.3% dividend. For context, their net income Q1 was $800m+.

Share Buybacks: Boomers love getting their capital returned in a slow, and boring way. UWMC has a $300 million share buyback underway right now.

Mat Ishbia: Mat is a CEO boomers love. He played team sports and won an NCAA national championship riding the bench at Michigan State. Boomers love reading stories like that because they always preached hard work to their own kids from the couch.

So either a short term or long term investment, boomer or millenial, $UWMC looks interesting.",DD,0.88

(Source: Scion Asset Management 13F) [He was even payed a visit by the SEC due to this warning](https://www.businessinsider.in/stock-market/news/big-short-investor-michael-burry-says-hell-stop-tweeting-after-sec-regulators-paid-him-a-visit/articleshow/81569128.cms), prompting him to delete his twitter account.

The FED only has two options at the moment:

Raise rates to curb current inflation. This would cause the treasury to raise its coupon rates (bond interest), which would mean lower bond prices. This means the government has to pay higher interest, ultimately leaving the treasury no other option than defaulting on its obligations.

2. The FED doesnt raise rates, and lets inflation (and later hyperinflation) eat away at the dollar. This would also make the bonds worth less, as theyd have to lower the price to compensate for the interest being worth nothing. In this situation, the fed would be the only one willing to hold government bonds which would worsen the inflation as they effectively dont get payed interest on it.

Option one, the government goes bankrupt due to interests being to high to pay back. Option two, the public goes bankrupt due to hyperinflation.

Either way, a short position would profit in this trade.

453,TLRY,nktkfy,2021-05-25 18:18:02,Legalisation of marijuana is proceeding. Possibly TLRY (Tilray) will explode soon,"The US House of Representatives passed a bill last month that would allow banks to provide services to cannabis companies in the US. Thus, the banks would no longer operate illegal and unlawful financing should they offer loans and other services to the companies. That would be a huge step in removing what analysts are calling an obstacle to the development of a national cannabis industry.

Legislators voted for the bill with 321-101 votes and sent it to the Senate.

https://preview.redd.it/5mpqdo4tja171.jpg?width=660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1255ec4f5a2471772ca27ad86ea25c16167d241b

The bill clarifies that proceeds from legal cannabis deals are not considered illegal and instructs federal regulators to create rules on how they would oversee such banking activities. Banks have so far been unwilling to do business with companies that sell marijuana or related products, fearing they could run into conflict with US federal law. This has left marijuana companies with few options to rely on a handful of small financial institutions or do cash deals. The American Bankers Association has aggressively lobbied for the SAFE Banking Act bill.

The banks have been in a difficult position due to the conflict between state and federal law, so it makes sense that Congress must act now to resolve this conflict. Thirty-six US states have now legalized medical cannabis, while 17 states already allow recreational use of cannabis by adults.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would try to push legislation. The positive reaction of the stock prices of Tilray, Sundial Growers, Aphria or Aurora Cannabis shows the great relief of investors. Investors hope that this could have kicked off further progressive reforms in the cannabis sector. This move took the potential of a game-changing marijuana law an important step forward.

If Congress passes the SAFE Banking Act and President Joe Biden signs it, it would likely become much easier and cheaper for marijuana companies to raise the capital they need to fund their growth initiatives. The law should also make cannabis companies safer and more efficient, as credit services would reduce the need for cash in day-to-day operations.

Tilray's merger with Aphria paved the way for creating the world's largest cannabis company (by revenue). After checking out a lot about TLRY i was buying 1.170 Tilray-stocks today. I\`m sure this stock has really a lot of potential to explode completely.",DD,0.88

Entry point is as important as exit. RKT is trading at a generous $22.30 in AH action. It's still under it's price-point pre-earnings calls and far below the all-time-high of $43 (technically $48 as it hit that in AH trading). Some quick facts:

* RKT option calls are still cheap (IV is at reasonable levels)
* Option chain goes up to $58.89
* Last time RKT rocketed up, it went right to the top of the option chain
* Lots of potential tendies to be made, for example, $1,750 worth of $30 contracts could be worth $140K if it goes up to the top of the option chain ($58.89)
* Even buying shares can potentially lead to a nice 2.64x mutliple on your investment!

Why now?

* Bullish pattern in today's trading and is up 20% this week
* It's trading pattern has been independant of other meme stocks, suggesting a potential break out
* Positive retail sentiment = It's in the top 10 trending stocks on stocktwits
* It's close to an inclusion in the S&P 500 (Check this [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nsanas/rkt_is_nearly_in_the_sp_500_did_some_research_and/) for more info)

Not to mention that RKT is fundamentally undervalued!

* Profitable each quarter
* P/E ratio of 4.8 vs 30+ for high growth companies in S&P 500
* Dominant market position and insulated against interest rates because they are a workflow platform for brokers and therefore earnings are based more on the number of brokers on their platform rather than other metrics for traditional mortgage companies

463,WKHS,nqxtej,2021-06-03 00:10:41,Is WKHS next to moon???,"Common sense tells me **Workhorse (WKHS)** will take off.

Allow me to summarize:

1. Workhorse develops electric trucks.
2. We all know where the future is going with electric vehicles. The people want it, the government wants it, and a lot of private and public money is being poured in to make this happen. Legislation is aiming to make and force this to happen.
3. The government wants zero emissions. Workhorse trucks are already zero-emission. Gas and diesel-powered trucks are not. These companies are going to have a tough time catching up.
4. Workhorse has a proprietary system to help manage its fleet and increase its efficiency. This helps increase revenue.
5. Cathie Wood of Ark Investment Management, who has been very popular lately (google her), has purchased a few million shares for her fund
6. In April, Workhorse **more than doubled its production** of trucks in comparison to the **combined previous three quarters**. The Pride Group placed an order for 6230 trucks. That's **6230!!! That's an enormous amount of trucks.** They couldn't produce this because of global limitations. There is a bottleneck within the global supply chain in part due to offshore shipping delays of commodity raw materials and components. This has affected the entire industry, including Ford and GM. This is only **TEMPORARY** and will get worked out as it always does because every company wants to sell and make money.
7. Sales for the first quarter of 2021 were approximately $521,000 compared to approximately $84,000 in the first quarter of 2020. That is a significant increase.
8. The Company had approximately $205.1 million in cash in March 2021. This helps limit the need to acquire debt.
9. The stock has recently been beaten down due to having lost out on a $6 billion contract with the USPS. This makes for a prime opportunity to invest in this company. This one-time contract will not be the only contract that the USPS offers nor does it mean Workhorse will lose out on other contracts from the USPS or other companies.
10. 350,00 delivery trucks are sold per year according to the New York Times. This number will most likely increase.
11. Calls with a strike price of $15 for Jun 18, 2021 had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options. This may mean investors may be expecting a big move.
12. You're helping the environment by investing in this company.
13. **MOST IMPORTANTLY, this stock has about a 40% short of its float.** You want to give it to the hedge funds and the short sellers? You want to get in early on a short squeeze? This is the opportunity to make it happen. AMC was shorted about 20% on its float and look what it did. **WKHS is shorted about doubled that!!!**

TLDR

Workhorse (WKHS) is a highly-shorted (nearly 40%) stock with the potential for a very lucrative future. It is still priced pretty low. There is tremendous potential for gains here. Someone please try and prove me wrong. I beg you to try and prove me wrong.

Please note, I am not a financial analyst. I am a physician with a love of finance. I do not give financial advice. This is for educational purposes only and I may very well be completely wrong. You can lose all of your money on this stock. I personally like the stock and I own 10,000 shares of it.",DD,0.93

469,A,nhtxml,2021-05-21 16:32:27,"After almost 20 years of generally being very happy with Schwab, I am changing brokers. A short summary of my grievances.","**EDIT TLDR: OG chuck built an amazing pro retail firm that others slowly turned into PFOF grubby flaming pile of shit.**

Can't believe I'm gonna throw shade on a firm I used to love but they have REALLY gone down hill.  Don't feel like writing a wall of text but want to warn others who are thinking of switching into them so I'm just going to bullet point problems I've had.  If you are with them already and feel so-so about them... there are better options out there.  Moving money is a pain in the ass but it might be worth it.

**Issues I've had with them**

* Margin approval is like pulling teeth.  They want to grill you to death for like half an hour and slowly increase your options approval one step at a time (honestly some of those guys seem like idiots and I'm not sure how they got their certifications).  If they don't like exactly how you answer questions even as an experienced trader that's been doing it for a while, they will delay your application by up to 6 months before you can try again.  That hasn't happened to me fortunately but apparently they do that so I'm always very anxious talking to them.  I have $600k ish with them in all my accounts and my risk per trade is typically capped at $50-60k.  I tend to have extra cash if I need to average down or add something to hedge my position.  Never used margin even though I have it since it's required to do a lot of different trades.

* Frequent outages (especially at market open), error messages, slow to load in the browser portal.  Desktop platform ""StreetSmart"" is terrible IMO but I suppose that is a matter of taste.  They're portal option trading is otherwise aright, I've seen better and worse but nothing to write home about.

* $1k recently mysteriously disappeared in my account.  They were quick to correct it and apparently it's some ""very rare"" programming error but who the fuck knows for sure.  I'm sure a lot of retards out there don't even notice if money is ever missing.

* Finally, something that has always bothered me is that their execution doesn't seem that good.  With options especially +/- a couple pennies (or nickel for larger contracts) can actually make a huge difference on your P&L for a trade.  They are THE LEADER in PFOF revenue.  Fuck them.


When I joined them close to 20 years ago, I worshiped Charles Schwab.  You can google him but he was Good Guy broker when no one cared about retail back in the day.  Basically the OG pioneered the discount brokerage business.  You should read about his life, such a cool mfer.  Anyways, the firm it is today is totally different and basically a scummy imposter just using the name, if you're thinking about joining.  DON'T.

474,DD,n9x2bw,2021-05-11 15:30:54,UWMC: My Final DD on UWMC in Light of Q1 Earnings and Guided Q2 (Though Prior to Earnings Call),"Righty-o. This is my final DD on the stock. I'm going to continue purchasing more and more shares, selling way OTM covered calls to be able to buy even more shares up until such a point as my cost basis is below the share-price (My average being roughly 7.5 right now), or the share price nets me a dividend yield below 5.5%. I'm currently wholly allocated to this, and that's why while it would be attractive at a 3% or 4% yield, I'm not going to keep continuously purchasing it. After a certain threshold is reached in regards to the share-price I'll just use the premium on covered calls, and the dividend as a backboard to purchase other securities at that point in time. Considering any shares I buy at 6.38 will net me a dividend yield of 6.26% yield, and the premiums on monthly options that are at 7.5-10 can range from 40 cents to 13 cents for that month for May 21.., I'm well capitalized to receive a minimum 15-20% annual interest on this stock while ensuring significant upside protection in that if my covered calls are exercised they would be exercised at a significant premium to my average cost basis.

T Stock currently has a 6.4% dividend yield. Look at it's balance sheet. Look at UWMC's. Then look back at T's. You'll understand why it's considerably safer to park your money in UWMC. The Payout Ratio for T stock also takes up the majority of earnings per share and by a strong degree, whereas UWMC by dint of its Class A dividend shares only being 1/16th of the shares has a dividend payout ratio that is essentially nothing at 41.5 million dollars a year.

Add to the fact that UWMC has just declared a 300 million share buyback, when the public float is equivalent to 693,000,000 and you see why I think things are going to change by dint of the fact the company is flat out going to be able to buy 43.2% of the float  of exactly 110 million shares. Considering that the dividend is over 6.2% while their senior notes have interest payments of 5.5%.... It makes complete sense for them to immediately start doing buybacks starting today, which is the day they are allowed to start.

Here are some of my thoughts after reading the earnings report please be aware that this was with the share price at roughly 6.5:

The Earnings Report was a decidedly mixed bag, and there's no two ways about it. Here are some of my thoughts that are additional:

1. The 49.1B in origination was a whiff, as they guided for 52-57B in originations. Gain on sale fell right in the middle-ish which was fine. I was right to guide for a little less or roughly 1B in net income, and if the salaries, commissions, and benefits hadn't increased exponentially 123,624 million they would have met right around 1B at 983,624,000.
2. I like they are guiding up as opposed to everyone else for Q2, and considering their miss for Q1 I feel they may even be being conservative so as to not disappoint again. One thing I didn't like was that their gain on sale margin was expected to be .75%-1.1% for Q2, but one part of that may be that they have an in-house jumbo program where they retain servicing which might compress margin. With that said, there is definitely a pricing war going on, and as the CEO of LDI said we don't know when that'll end but as he stated no one likes to sell something for ninety cents on the dollar, and we can expect higher margins when the pricing war cools. Please note RKT's wholesale margin is expected to be 1%.
3. I like that they are investing in "" Continued investment into machine learning and Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to further advance our operational excellence while driving down costs."" Margin expansion is key, especially since they already have a margin advantage.
4. I like that they have ""Continued to invest in our technology platform and on-site teams resulting in additional operational efficiencies focused on reducing costs, reducing closing times, and increasing loan processing speed"" since, again, margin advantage. I also like reduced closing and loan processing speeds.
5. I like that: ""Our continued investments in the cloud, as well as technologies that increase Underwriting efficiency, such as Automated Document Recognition and Optical Character Recognition, have strengthened our technology advantage while driving greater efficiency, and reducing both fixed and variable costs."" Ditto with everything else.
6. Their jumbo and government portion of both refinance and purchase are extremely low relative to Q1 2020 because they only turned the spigot back on them the latter part of March. This is probably why it's so low, and why they are guiding up. Remember the gain on sale margin for government loans are smaller than conventional though so that might help explain some of the margin compression. This should also help them Q3 and Q4.
7. The seasonally adjusted annual homebuilding rate is at over 1.7 million home as April. There is a 4 million home backlog, and to keep up with demand home builders need to build 1.2 million homes a year. It needs to be more than 1.2 million to start reducing the backlog.
8. RKT's share price was roughly 20 dollars when it announced its 1 billion dollar buyback and had a market cap of 40 billion at the time. UWMC's market cap is roughly 10.8B. So it's market cap is exactly 27% what RKT's was at the time of the buyback. But the share buyback is 30% of RKT's. So there is more bang for buck. Additionally, there was a 1.1B special dividend of 1.1B which equated to roughly 5.5% at 20 dollars. The current annual yield on UWMC is over 6%. What's more, doing share buyback will increase EPS, net income, cash flow, and the balance sheet as opposed to RKT where it will only help EPS. Therefore, there is strong upside to be had at this price point.
9. I like that their highest expense (employees) is variable and stands at above 2/3rds of their expenses since it's easy to downsize in times of hardship, or they can choose to maintain staffing levels but not replace people to leave for a natural deceleration of income.
10. RKT  is expecting closed loan volume of between 82.5 to 87.5B. That's a sharp decrease in origination volume of between 15.5% and 20.3%. This is an strong indication that the UWMC ultimatum knee-capped them. Please remember that the UWMC Ultimatum deadline was March 15, and Q1 is for the period ended March 31 for RKT. Please note that the Partner Channel isn't just wholesale broker's as they also lump other things in there like their correspondent (referral) channel there. I also found the 7.5% increase from 37 and something to 40 billion from Q4 2020 to Q1 2021 to be quite small regardless, but Q2 makes clear you can expect downward guidance on their Wholesale channel. Now, while UWMC may have won the wholesale volume war, it's paying a price. The entire wholesale channel is. While rates rising means a lower gain on sale margin, the pricing wars are cutting deep into gain on sale margin to. With that said, there is eventually going to be rationality as this cannot go on forever. No one likes to sell something for ninety cents when they can sell it for a dollar. So I call the gain on sale margin variable in essence. Finally, I expect investments to bear fruit and increase margin offsetting some of the pricing wars affect on GOS (for both sides to be fair).
11. I'm revising my expectations of 2-2.5 Billion dollars a year in net income to roughly 1.5-2.25 Billion, and I am being very conservative on the low end. I am calculating roughly 500 million in net income for Q2 2021 to be somewhat conservative. The way I am coming to that conclusion is by calculating a 49.1B origination for Q2 even though they are guiding for 51-55B (and considering the embarrassment of the whiff, and the new products they have on offer to increase capacity, I believe them to be conservative). I am also assuming a 75 basis point margin on gain on sale which is a touch more than 34% of the margin for Q1 2021. Under these presumptions they would be making 368,035,000 in loan production income. I am going to flat out live in delusion land and assume that Mortgage Servicing Income remains the same at 115,205,000 after accounting for the fact that mortgage servicing income minus change in fair value, plus gain on sale, and interest income equals that. That totals revenue of 483,240,000. I am going to assume the absolute worst and assume that they don't compress their expenses whatsoever and so their expenses will tally 317,000,000. Thus their net income will be 166,240,000.

I won't place the income tax because: ""UWMC's net income for periods prior to the first quarter of 2021 does not reflect an income tax provision, since UWM (UWMC's accounting predecessor) is a pass-through entity not subject to federal and most state income taxes. For periods commencing with the first quarter of 2021, UWMC's net income does not reflect the income tax provision that would otherwise be reflected if 100% of the economic interest in UWM was owned by UWMC. Therefore, for comparison purposes, UWMC provides ‚ÄúAdjusted net income‚Äù, which is our pre-tax income adjusted for a 23.78% estimated effective tax rate. ‚ÄúAdjusted net income‚Äù is a Non-GAAP Metric.""

If one looks at the net income attributable to UWMC on the cash flow statement and then divides by the provision for income taxes, then that is an effective tax rate of 26.8% for roughly 5.7% of the float which is roughly the 6 percent of free float. What I am trying to say is that we only pay net income on the 6% of free float that is the Class A public float. The adjusted net income would be if the entirety of the company was taxed, which it isn't, so disregard adjusted net income as it's not GAAP. We'll assume a 25 percent haircut to income tax as a result (though it would be a higher haircut, I'm just lazy) which would give taxes of 9,664.

After accounting for federal and state taxes, the new net income would be 166,230,336. Net income and thus EPS is pre dividend income, but let's count the dividend before EPS and count it as part of net income for a truly catastrophic scenario. So, let's assume no share buybacks occurred (worst case scenario), we'd then remove 10,310,420.5 (.10\* 103,104,205). The new net income after accounting for dividends is 155,919,916. Please note that in accounting you don't calculate the net income by putting the dividend as a expense. I'm just doing this to give you guys an absolute shit tier scenario with revenue misses, no mortgage servicing rights increases and thus no mortgage servicing income and interest increases, no margin gain, expenses that do not decrease, a bit more tax than they'd actually pay, no shares bought back, and dividends as an expense and thus weigh down on net income and thus EPS. I did not count the interest expense on the new 700 million senior notes however. But it should come to roughly 31 million.

The EPS would be .097, so round it to ten cents. Account for the same EPS for Q3 and Q4. You get 30 cents. This is 30 cents without the dividend payout ratio since the dividend is already accounted for. We'll not include Q1. The dividend of 40 cents alone will net you a p/e ratio of 16.175. The actual EPS for you as a class A shareholder would be 70 cents for the period Q2 to Q4. That would translate to a P/E ratio of 9.24. If you count the EPS of Q1 (which is Earnings per share of .47) then the FY 2021 EPS would be .70 and the P/E ratio would be 8.64. But if you count the dividend of .40 in addition to the EPS then it becomes 1.17 and the P/E ratio becomes 5.52. The only reason I count the dividend is because the dividend payout ratio is literally .006 (.10\*.06=.006) per quarter. However, you're still getting ten cents a quarter on a stock that is 6.47 while retaining your economic interest in the company itself which is adding roughly 77 cents in EPS FY 2021 under a catastrophic failure of epic proportions scenario.

My positions: Roughly 7200 shares, and 49 7.5 call options for May (Those have taken a shit lmao). ",DD,0.91

Keep in mind technicals are not a crystal ball, they are a **road map.** I do not hold a position *(although if I looked at the chart Friday, I would).*

[$SPCE 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/c32m1rk5eq071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d477968e5afc2875bca36a471e1c77bd84adcbd)

Here you can see we **broke out of a large descending wedge on Friday** (with fantastic volume). This is the same pattern damn near every speculative growth stock has been caught in for the past few months. Normally it has a bearish bias - because it is coming from downside. However, in this scenario - **it broke up -** which means **we can see some fantastic follow through to the upside.**

The price targets for this setup would be **22.61, 26.18, 28.05, 29.71.** These are all resistances - and in a normal situation you would either trim as we run into these, or scale in as we clear them.

However - given the news catalyst - it's hard to say how high we will gap up on Monday. Above that last level is **34.84** and **36.63.** It's unlikely we cross these without an insane short squeeze, or another pattern forming (at least on the shorter term charts).

Remember, each time we clear one of these levels on a **daily close -** it will become a support. As a result, you can trail your stop loss below them as we continue.

This is one of many examples of **""technicals precede news""** I have encountered throughout my trading career - and one of the reasons I try to ignore anything except for the charts while I am trading. It's hard to quantify arbitrary events - and especially hard to do so without bias. Thankfully, we will often **break out of a major pattern prior to a news release -** like you see here.

I'll be looking to day trade this stock next week depending where we open.

***TL;DR*** \- $SPCE broke out Friday & has positive news to help it along next week

Price targets are **22.61, 26.18, 28.05, 29.71**

While at home I had nothing to do, so my cousin introduced me to way of making money while recovering and you guessed it was the magic of stock options. After a few weeks of making a couple thousand bucks, I decided to put my  whole $10k worth of savings into options. So I basically went from 10k -> 28k -> 50k -> 7 bucks in a span of probably 6 months. After hitting basically rock bottom I realized now that had to actually work to get money. So I got a job working at an Amazon Facility. After 6 months of a slow and arduous climb I got back to my original starting point of 10k plus some. So the going to 7 bucks made me a bit more careful about my money, but just last week I put $100 bucks into AMC options and it gained more than %1000, so I was like fuck it YOLO ALL-IN AMC, I've been here before I can do it again, although I did think that with a little bit of melancholy.  Also I'm sorry I did sell back my initial investment of 17k, and it's with a little bit of spite but I had to think of my student loans, the hospital bills, and other stuff I have to pay for. But honestly I might use the money to execute some these calls if after paying for all that shit, I still have some left.
