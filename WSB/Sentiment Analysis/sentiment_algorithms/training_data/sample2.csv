4,A,nsau7r,2021-06-04 19:39:22,Energy Transfer ($ET)... A Monster in Hibernation. Lets Send it to the MOON,"With all the hype this week doubt this gets read but wanted to post my first DD and hopefully share the love with my fellow smooth brain friends. This will probably be way too long for many, but hoping some will read it...

I love Energy Transfer ($ET) and think you could make at least *30%* this year... not to mention the options with extraordinarily low IV. I picked up 75 LEAPS a few months back and they have made a killing.

&#x200B;

[ET Proof of GAINZ](https://preview.redd.it/uzgxq44w9a371.png?width=454&format=png&auto=webp&s=74ff495e0b14effadfcbaf7bc395950918262485)

You've probably never heard of it but ET is one of the largest energy infrastructure companies in the U.S., consisting of 90,000 miles of pipelines, large amounts of storage capacity, 62 natural gas processing and treating facilities, 35 active refined products marketing terminals, and immense exporting capabilities. Its a MASSIVE company that has $40 Billion in revenue and a market cap of 27.4B... yes, you read that correctly.

Plus as a a partnership they give a ***7% distribution*** per year. They will pay you to hold the stock while it prints money and adds value (I have shares too). And you're not too late! The stock jumped from $10.15 last week to $10.75 today and the options prices have barely budged... just picked up 100 call contracts for October in anticipation of earnings. You can literally still pick up an $11 Call for10/15 for less than a dollar ($0.92) and if you're like me trading GME, BB, and even NOK that is mind blowing.

***Financial Metrics:***

Current Price: \~$11.00; Pre-Pandemic: $13.55 ; Average Price Target: $13.35

Revenue: $40 Billion ; Market Cap: $28 Billion

P/E: 8 ; Yield *7.2%*

***Key Activities Past Year:***

\- Booked an unexpected 5 billion in revenue related to the Texas winter storm and aggressively paid down debt

\- Acquired Enable Midstream for $7 Billion in all equity transaction which improved their debt metrics and expanded the portfolio ([https://ir.energytransfer.com/news-releases/news-release-details/energy-transfer-acquire-enable-midstream-7-billion-all-equity](https://ir.energytransfer.com/news-releases/news-release-details/energy-transfer-acquire-enable-midstream-7-billion-all-equity))

\- Offering new series funding to lower cost of debt ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/energy-transfer-lp-announces-pricing-001500674.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/energy-transfer-lp-announces-pricing-001500674.html))

\- Cut dividend last year to help with debt, but could reinstate due to positive momentum

If we keep the price up and continue to purchase, we will pressure all of the shorts and encourage the long calls to exercise their contracts. This is how the squeeze works if some of you apes forgot.

June 18 a crayon load of options will expire, good and bad alike. If the price stays above 20 bananas, a ton of people will decide to purchase all the crayons that they were planning which will inject bumloads of crayons into the stonk. The shorts will also need to cover their positions, which will be the real squeeze. It's a recipe for bananas.

1. This stock is ACTUALLY heavily shorted. Users with YOLO positions already in place have made this clear. Currently around 11.5% of the float is sold short, and with a float of 272 million shares, that's pretty sizable.
2. Check out this beauty of a chart

In case you're looking for some deeper DD, I suggest you check out the other [BCRX DD article](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mtzhp2/bcrx_dd_the_embarrassment_of_riches/) I wrote.

&#x200B;

* **2021 Q1 ER Beat**

On May the 6th, 2021 BCRX presented Q1 Earnings Report data which managed  ***Beat Analysts estimates***. Basically what matters from this ***Q1 ER*** is that it was the ***launch of Orladeyo***, and Analysts wanted to see a decent amount of money generated by it. They were expecting Orladeyo sales to top ***$3.1MM*** and Orladeyo actually generated ***$10.94MM***, this is a ***353% sales beat***

https://preview.redd.it/uppmf8dy09z61.png?width=765&format=png&auto=webp&s=7215a9fc3d12ae2ead2bb782802742ef8ab998cb

The consequence of the ER beat was an increase of **24.06%** in the **SP**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3dhmebmo39z61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8876fcc6c02233d347ec7bab257ef079d5ea74e6

&#x200B;

It's *really important* to mention that **revenues generated this Q1** only came from the **USA**.

This **Q2 Orladeyo** has been **approved in Japan/Europe/UK** aswell, adding new sources of revenue.

&#x200B;

**Orladeyo sales** are expected to **grow exponentially** **each quarter**. Main reason for it is that it has been approved in the countries mentioned above. The other reason is that the amount of **patients** they treat will **slowly score up** as **insurance companies allow** their clients to be treated with this drug.

&#x200B;

The data displayed below shows the amount of patients using Orladeyo in 3 or 4 pharmacies which provide information to Bloomberg. This numbers help us track how Orladeyo's sales evolve, but it's not 100% accurate.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qw97n7ga89z61.png?width=1257&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d353dc8fe919da2f4e10d6c5f68527c7cb7813b

If we sum up the numbers from Q1 we get a total of 43 patients, in the first month of Q2 there are 38 new patients already. Meaning Orladeyo nearly managed to get in a single month all the amount of patients it gathered in Q1, **reasuring the exponential growth.** This numbers will keep rising now that Orladeyo is approved in more countries.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* **Orladeyo**™ **(Berotralstat) oral pill**

&#x200B;

Orladeyo is the ***first Oral approved*** treatment used to prevent swelling attacks in people with ***hereditary angioedema (HAE)*****,** disease which is estimated to affect ***1 in 50,000 people.***

&#x200B;

\- Orladeyo was firstly approved in the ***USA*** ***December the 3rd,*** ***2020. Q4***

\- Orladeyo received ***Japan*** NHI price listing approval ***April the 14th, 2021. Q2***

\- Orladeyo received ***Europe*** approval ***April the 30th, 2021 Q2***

\- Orladeyo received ***UK*** approval ***May the 12th, 2021 Q2***

&#x200B;

***CEO*** himself, Jon Stonehouse ***confirmed*** in the [last conference call, ( 22:15 )](https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/mqqo89/bcrx_biocryst_apr_14_2021_at_845_am_edt_20th/) ***Orladeyo will annually*** be generating ***$500MM Plus revenue.***

&#x200B;

\-Serge Belanger ( ***Analyst*** ): I think in the past you've talked about ***sales potential for Orladeyo of 500 million plus***, are you still reiterating that target?

\- Stonehouse ( ***CEO*** ): ***Yeah make sure you remember the plus.***

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

***Orladeyo*** is [ranked](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/pharmacy/20-most-expensive-prescription-drugs-in-2021.html) the ***#13 most expensive drug*** ***in the USA*** market. ***$37,308*** is approximately what patients ( insurances ) must monthly pay to access the drug.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/68per70ny8z61.png?width=672&format=png&auto=webp&s=9146f6c55c4280ab48b5af36f4a46edaa603807c

The fact ***Orladeyo*** is ***taken*** ***orally it's huge.*** Back then before ***Oral Orladeyo*** was approved for HAE, ***patients*** would only have treatments that required usage of ***needles,*** there were ***no other oral treatments approved to treat HAE***. This dramatically ***reduced the*** ***quality of their life***, making some of them stop using the treatment. That's why ***Orladeyo is a game changer***.

As it's shown in[ the January 2021 Corporate Presentation](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 16), Physicians expect to Prescribe ***Orladeyo for over 40% of HAE Patients.***

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* **Pricings/Revenue**

&#x200B;

**USA**

In the USA there currently are 10,000 patients, ***7500 diagnosed and treated,*** 1700 diagnosed but not treated, 600 treated but not diagnosed.

Physicians expect to prescribe ***Orladeyo for over 41% of HAE patients***. Conservatively thinking, taking 7,500 patients ( the diagnosed and treated ones ) out of the total 10,000 pool in the USA, with over[ 41% of patients prescription](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) ( page 16 ) we would conservatively aim for ***3,075 patients.***

The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in the USA, is equal to ***485,000$***

&#x200B;

**Japan**

On November the 5th Biocryst undergone an agreement with ***Torii Pharmaceuticals.*** A local Japanese company that will be in charge of getting new patients to be treated with Orladeyo in Japan and commerzialing it.

Japan has around 2,500 HAE patients, and Biocryst conservatively expects to ***at*** ***least reach 500 patients.***

The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in Japan, is equal to ***$248,500***

***Approval of Orladeyo in Japan issued a $15MM milestone payment*** from Torii.

***BioCryst will receive*** tiered royalties ranging from ***20% - 40% of Japanese sales.***

&#x200B;

**Europe**

It's estimated to be around ***12,000 HAE patients in Europe.*** Following the physician prescription of over[ 41% of patients to prescribe](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 16) for Orladeyo. We get a total of ***4,920 patients*** in Europe.

Since pricings and jurisdictions work in a different way in Europe, the amount of money each patient will have to pay for Orladeyo is expected to be around or above Japan's ***$248,500/year.*** This number should soon be confirmed.

&#x200B;

**United Kingdom**

It's estimated there are **1500-2000 HAE** patients in there, **1000 of them diagnosed**. Following the physician prescription of over[ 41% of patients to prescribe](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 16) for Orladeyo we should expect to capture 400 patients.

Orladeyo price in UK is expected to be similar to the one in Japan \~ ***$248,500/year***. meaning **$99,400,000** revenue with 400 patients.

Sup, honorable apecitizens!

I am so confident in it, that I dared to put my beard (which I have for five years already) on the line! Worth your full read, I promise! I decided to structure the analysis in the following way: first we'll take a look at the VW short squeeze, revisiting its origins and background as the very first step of the discussion - in order to better understand the fundamental context of TA; after that I'll lay down the main technical parameters and frameworks, through which the [GMESS](https://imgur.com/a/Sd4uE1b) thesis will be dissected, applying all of those to VWSS and explaining the TA core on the Volkswagen example; then, the process will be repeated, but this time TSLASS anatomy will be elaborated upon. Finally, all of the data accumulated in the process, as well as the major findings made, will be applied to the current technical state of GME, in order to construct at least a potential forecast and the probable price action. Buckle up and eat a crayon, let's start.

Oh, and one more thing! I really encourage you to dive deep into the ANALysis with me, because the thesis can only be understood if all of the technical factors at play are considered in the sharpest detail first - and then in the aggregate: zooming out and looking at the bigger picture through the prism of coincidences, interdependences and probabilities.

# Volkswagen - Das Short-Squeeze: Sep 2007 - Mar 2009

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Remember, when VW became the most valued company in the world for a brief wild period of trading? I bet, Pepperidge apes remember. The squeeze played out right in the midst of the global financial crisis, and such an occurrence was fueled by a curious background scenario, orchestrated largely by one very interesting person. Back then, the former President of Porsche, Wendelin Wiedeking (must be a cousin of Battlefield Counterstrike), was pursuing a goal of taking over Volkswagen. In this process, he used cash-settled options to circumvent the transparency and disclosure of Porsche’s market operations. While being acquired by Porsche, Volkswagen had its ordinary shares premium risen to disproportionately high levels compared to its preference shares.

As the general public was finding out about Wendysking’s takeover plan, hedge funds and particularly short-sellers set their eyes on the fact that Volkswagen’s preferred shares were traded at a significant discount to the ordinaries (approximately 70%). While the price of the ordinary stock gradually increased, the preferential shares stayed put - and the hedge funds smelt an arbitrage opportunity. They started shorting the stock and buying the preferred shares to profit on the massive divergence. For a moment, there was no news of Porsche continuing its purchase of VW ordinaries from the market, and that fact gave the hedge funds additional confidence. Only to get blindsided, as it turned out later. One shorts-frying weekend, Porsche announced its total holding in VW, cornering the substantial part of the float, and leaving only 6% in free float. In the meantime, short sales had risen to 12% of total stock outstanding. When the market found out that Porsche had acquired 74.1% of the outstanding shares through the in-transparent cash-settled options, VWSS happened - briefly making Volkswagen the largest company in the world, and finally allowing the shorting side to [GUH](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpnzup/i_recorded_todays_marketopen_and_the_instant/):

&#x200B;

>It was mathematically impossible for every short-seller to buy a share, and therefore close their position. In other words, half the room were going to be left in a burning building with no way out. A panicked dash for the exit began.

&#x200B;

— A spot on metaphor by Jamie Powell, an FT journalist. Hedge funds are estimated to have lost $20 to $30 billion by betting against VW ordinary stock.

What is really ironic (in Palpatine voice) - even though Porsche managed to burn many short sellers, the company couldn’t pay up for the huge positions it had created, and ended up being acquired by VW instead.

Also, interestingly enough, after his departure from Porsche, Wiedeking was charged with market manipulation for his role in the takeover bid. The charges were dropped in July 2016 due to a too little chance of success. Lucking Fegend.

&#x200B;

**Now let’s take a look at how this epic event was incorporated into the chart:**

[VWSS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/d3pfzvb202z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e497ddf6518faec188269120c44df64ab6cb1791)

Even though it all looks overwhelming from the first glance, don't worry, I'll explain. There are only two major TA instruments used here, namely Fibonacci retracement 🌈tool (useful for assessing 'altitude' and the crucial support/resistance levels, check out the in-depth explanation of this TA tool [in my other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mwevzz/the_big_short_20_why_bears_may_soon_reconsider/)). The second one is the trend based Fibonacci extension for time periods (pink vertical grid with numbers 0, 0.382, 0.618 and so on) - for setting the major time landmarks and zones. Furthermore, you should have noticed the three catchy geometric figures, and the purple line - which is actually a good starting point to unfold the technical thesis.

In the process of working with VW, TSLA and GME charts, I managed to identify several peculiar characteristics and patterns, that were of an evident nature and have been manifested on all of the three charts, to one degree or another. The most prominent one, in my opinion, is the killer purple resistance/support level. For the current VW example, it is somewhere around $30 mark, or $29.27 if you like precision.

One may observe on the chart above, that this level is indeed the most significant level through the complete history of VWSS. First, the preliminary to the squeeze major bull run, which solidly accelerated in the middle of September 2007, was held back and repulsed by this level's resistance on the last day of October. It took almost half a year for the price action to catch up to it again in late March 2008. This was followed by a consolidation (with several failed attempts of breakout) just below this level, which lasted for more than 100 days, before the price action finally torn the resistance apart with the powerful gap on the 16th of July '08. And guess what? Even after that, the level played the major supportive role for the price action, with one final retest before the squeeze finally lift off it in the middle of September 2008. You should also make a note of how the price was still magnetized by this level during the final stages of the squeeze. The signifficance of this price level for the whole chart of VW above is difficult to underestimate. Seeing the importance of this level and being a fan of Jimi Hendrix, I decided to name it ""**Purple Haze**"".

Let's inspect the fancy geometric shapes now. These are actually much more reasoned and circumspective than it may seem from the first glance. The first one, in orange, is a cup shaped consolidation (let it be called the ""**Squeezy Grail**"", because why not?) - taking place above 100% Fibo and just below the 'Purple Haze'  - which commenced as soon as this major resistance level had been tested for the first time. It is subsequently followed by the second consolidation of a flatter nature \[if you know what else is of a flatter nature, comment and if the joke is good enough I may give you an award\], which again plays around the main $30 level on the chart. The second consolidation, highlighted by the pink rectangle (a.k.a. the ""**Runway**""), is actually more important than the first one, because here is the point where the paramount breakout happens: the 'Purple Haze' resistance is blew off (in the middle of 0.382 period). Based on that observation, it is also appropriate to assume that in order for the squeeze to initiate, the 'Purple Haze' has to be conquered at some point inside 0.382 Fibo time zone, during the 'Runway' stage. Finally, the triangular ""**Squieezluminati Confirmed**"" part is self explanatory, imho. Oh, just one commentary worth being made here: take a look at how the squeeze itself is proportionate, bipartite, and fits well into the isosceles triangle. The nature surely knows how to play with stonks, too.

Especially, when we talk about Fibonacci. The horizontal 🌈 grid, Fibo retracement, is often used to estimate the possible corrective trend's depth, as well as to identify the key support and resistance levels of it. This one is comfortably applied to the beninging and the apex point of the trend (see the gray dash and dash line on the chart above), and its relevance is subsequently confirmed by how the price action plays around the levels in the triangle. The 12th of September '07 seems to be a good starting point for Fibo retracement application, because on that day another important resistance of $20.72 was penetrated for the first time (then confirmed as support with the beautiful bear trap candle on 23 Jan '08). Furthermore, $20.72 level works like an ideal 100% Fibo retrace level for the current example, and supports the 'Holy Grail' comparable to how my granny supports me. Also, take a note of the 'Purple Haze' being relatively in the middle, in between 78.6% and 100% of Fibo retracement - an important factor that will enable us to apply this retracement to GME later.

Not only the 12th of September fits well as Fibo retracement starting point, it is also a perfect spot to start stretching out the trend-based Fib time grid (TBFTG - to be fucked then go, alternatively). This one is a complex instrument, so take this quick explanation for granted or do your own research in relation to it. Just like Fibo retracement, TBFTG is based on Fibonacci sequence, but this one applies to time periods, instead of the price action and levels. In order to use this instrument properly, it is necessary to identify the preliminary major trend, that will serve as the core measurement for the sequent time periods. Oh, it took me a lot of time to inspect that parameter and to identify those initial pink dash and dash trends, trust me! Tbh, it was one of the most difficult tasks to accomplish in the preparation of this TA. But the result was worth the effort! I noticed the following correlation applicable to both VWSS and TSLASS (and hypothetically to GME too): TBFTG pink dash measurement must involve the major preliminary impulse of the prior main trend, plus 'Squeezy Grail' phase. The staring point of TBFTG is particularly tricky to be identified, and I'm talking about all of the examples, but possible - especially when looking at the TA as a whole, referring to how the grid applies to the price action, and comparing the examples between each other. That is pure rocket science, if you ask me. And most importantly, the TBFTG measurement duration (pink dash and dash trend) seem to be very similar in length to 'Squieezluminati' basis - check the bars measurements on all of the charts (blue lines for VW).

Pay attention to the following features, which really help to dissect the squeezes' anatomies and to build the suitable technical framework: *the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone; and the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, peaking at 1*; *TBFTG pink dash measurement includes major preliminary trend plus 'Squeezy Grail', as it has been mentioned above. Furthermore, the correlation in duration of TBFTG measurement and the triangle basis must once again be emphasized.*

Noice, but let's move further.

# Tesla, or how Elon Mask truly “is become meme, Destroyer of shorts”: Apr 2019 - Apr 2020

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Tesla and the founder Elon Musk have confronted the short sellers on a regular basis, and even after the run-ins with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for now, the former have been winning. The TSLA shorters were sitting on mark-to-market losses of over $40 billion in late 2020, as the company’s shares exploded 740% last year. This information is based on data collected by Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, a fin-anal company.

Remember the not so distant in past Tesla 'mania'? The prospects of Tesla’s business and the furious opposition of bulls and bears, including famous fund managers like David Einhorn and Mark Spiegel (who still hold a strong opinion that TSLA is a house of cards ready to collapse), have over the years contributed to an extreme volatility in the stock price. Elon Musk openly criticized the short-sellers and their motivation to dig out and spread negative sentiment about the company. The 'taking Tesla private' play seemed to work out for the short-sellers as the stock price collapsed by about 50% from November 2018 to May 2019. After that, amidst Tesla’s opening of the Shanghai Gigafactory and the announcement of the company's first annual operating profit exceeding analyst expectations, the tables have turned and the bear-beaten TSLA shares skyrocketed in price (not without noble WSBetters help, definitely). Needless to say, that previously steady short-sellers started getting anxious and scrambled to cover their positions.

&#x200B;

Dusaniwsky told Institutional Investor (B2B media) that shorting Tesla is:

>The longest unprofitable short I’ve ever seen!

&#x200B;

Well, Mr. Dusaniwsky, WSB seem to have an answer for everything:

https://preview.redd.it/h3l5hayu02z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecc69df97a282c4a22663e8487cf316488ed9d32

&#x200B;

While companies and founders often hold a scorn on short sellers, because they can bring down stock prices and cause the cost of capital to rise (or even do worse things, if you know what I mean), Musk’s disdain for the short selling community is unrivaled. In the middle of 2020, Musk took a dig at short sellers by releasing 'short shorts'. These now sell at a premium on Ebay. It's all nice and good, but I have another cool merch idea - '**shortz r fuk**':

[TSLASS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/f0qbrpqn22z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=479c78e6763043f81e9ac2c75cf8a6c769d9eee4)

&#x200B;

Beautiful, isn't it? Let's quickly run through the short squeeze anatomy checklist, thoroughly elaborated in the previous TA chapter via the example of VW. First things first, the 'Squeezy Grail' is present, but it resembles more of a V shape structure. Next, the 'Runway' stage is good-looking: a fucking massive gap happened there, and this time 78.6% Fibo level is tested during the 'Runway', being indicative of the TSLA bulls' crazy power. 'Squieezluminati Confirmed' is also really interesting here, as this time there is no isosceles triangle at its core structure, but rather a 'chainsaw'-like volatile price action taking place. Furthermore, you may see that inside of the triangle, there is the after-peak 78.6% Fibo zone retest, which in turn hedl and bounced the price back in the direction of... Moon. Blessed be the bulls!

Looking at the 'Purple Haze' (which is again in between Fibo 78.6% and 100% \[important!\]), for TSLASS the major price level manifested at $52.46. During the first half of 2019, this level played a role of a magnetizing support, with the subsequent testing in March and the breakout to the downside in late April. Again, a lengthy, half a year long consolidation is taking place just below this level, and above Fibo 100% retracement. The breakout occurs, you guessed, right in the TBFTG 0.382 zone. And what is really fascinating, is the fact that, after the breakout, the 'Purple Haze' has never been retested. But who knows what the future holds?

And the Fibos. The retracement, again, apples perfectly onto the complete squeeze structure: 78.6% is trialed several times; all of the upper levels except for 38.2% were broken with the subsequent retrace and and some with the retest. A particularly intensive price action was occurring for about two weeks near the 23.6% Fibo level, and the high of $189.4 level was penetrated and then touched gently during the initial squeeze. Ah, almost forgot, 100% ($35.75) Fibo level firmly holds the 'Squeezy Grail' in hand again.

Current TBFTG should be of an interest for fellow TAnaLyzators too. Particularly, the downtrend, as opposed to VW uptrend, serves as the core for TBFTG's application (again, refer to the dash and dash pinkish line). This core is composed of the pre-'Squeezy Grail' downtrend plus the Grail itself. Take a look at gray measurements, which cover this phase and the triangle duration - again these two follow the tendency of being proportionate in the length as phases. *Crucially, the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone again; then one more time the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, with the false first peak during the final stages of 0.618 and the proper peak at 1*.

Too many coincidences and congruences between the two TA examples discussed above, if you ask me. Especially if the fact that such events happen once in ten years or so is taken into account. Two quotes are of a relevance here:

&#x200B;

>Coincidences mean you're on the right path - *Simon van Booy*

&#x200B;

>If you gaze long enough into an asshole, the asshole will gaze back into you - u/roman_axt

&#x200B;

Some additional food for thought from TSLA:

[For redditors with a different floor](https://preview.redd.it/gnd0yienc2z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8b72e1671ad69cf871cde154ae386e52835e94a)

# Game stopped, or it is just a beginning?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I am absolutely confident that you all know even more than myself about the fundamental factors at play for GME, so I will not bother you here with the background explanation. There is a plenty of good HQ DD all around reddit, so let's jump straight to the sweet sweet TA:

[GMESS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/ko1ppnasc2z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d3f7c2a78135696d66a0a70e8e2a34ad4a04dbf)

&#x200B;

At this point, I feel that a disclaimer is necessary. Let me briefly remind you that this analysis is a thesis, or a hypothesis that has to be proven in the future. I do believe that there is a solid probability for things to play out this way, and my beard supports my manly confidence. However, this is the market, and it all may go another way at any point in time, that's the nature of things! Think critically, learn and do your own DD and TA. In a good memory of u/ControlTheNarrative, at least.

And so, it begins. Despite it may seem that there are too many unknown or at least questionable variables for now in this GMESS TA, I believe that I was able to identify the most crucial parameters to build the core of this technical analysis's thesis, since VWSS and TSLASS provided many clues and identifiable characteristics to refer to. The first and most important one is surely the 'Purple Haze'. I should remind you, that this mystically sounding level persistently held back the price for both of the squeeze examples discussed, and only upon the breakout of this level the short squeezes were initiated. For GME this major price level seems to be at about $233 mark, with two intensive tests in Jan and Mar, which proved it to be the most significant resistance on the chart above.

Then, the shapes. The 'Squeezy Grail' (again occurring in between 78.6% and 100%) consolidation is also easily identifiable here, and it is yet again followed by the rectangular 'Runway' consolidation, where the price action currently stands. Remember, how historically (in TSLA and VW) the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurred somewhere near the spot of the current GME price action, in 0.382 Fibo time zone? Well, to paraphrase Ian Fleming: once is (VW) happenstance. Twice is (TSLA) coincidence. Three times is GMenemy action.

Fibos. Applying these two instruments to GME was real pain in the ass. Firstly, because the retracement is not usually used as a predictive instrument, being ordinarily applied to the completed trend. But since the situation is not ordinary at all, I played smarter (or more autistic, if you like). Due to the fact that the 'Purple Haze' level was approximately in between 78.6% and 100% Fibo in both of the previous examples, I assumed exactly that to be applicable here too. My belief is firmly backed up by this soft touch of 78.6% by the price action on Jan 28th. And when these two major levels were identified, the Fibo retracement horizontal grid just stretched out on GME itself.

Identifying the starting points for the trend for both Fibos was the most tricky part. After countless attempts and failures I found what I believe to be the cornerstone to the squeeze:

Why? Because this                        ☝️ is clearly where the fun started.

And now it all matches perfectly. So, I am patiently waiting for the 'Purple Haze' to be broken. And what do you do, fellow retard?

Last time with the GME squeeze we saw all the meme stocks going up and it seems to be happening again with AMC. I am a meme stock holder and saw that BB was on the rise. I firmly believe in the future of this company on the long term and it's potential. If you want to know more about the company go check some dds and you'll be amazed

&#x200B;

When I went to look at the share statistics, I saw that it was very shorted but I am not sure if this means we have a next AMC on our hands or if that's just regular things. What do y'all think?

67,BB,nvo3ym,2021-06-09 07:26:19,$BB - Expect Large Movements Within 1 Month - Part 7,"Another day another analysis.

The past two days have looked stronger than you may think. Let's look at the chart.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6cuvfei3e6471.png?width=1926&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d0c6d898c08d0b5627c8f842c2f2b908a4e294e

Sitting right at the top of the Bollinger band, strong signal that the upside will continue. Still large volume today and yesterday means that the \~$15-16 USD range is going to act as a strong base for us going forward.  
200DMA moving upwards, Bollinger Bands slightly still expanding, looks bullish. 

The hourly chart will paint us a better picture for our baseline.  


https://preview.redd.it/yk78c534e6471.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=f31b4e32c5bd961cdfd1b9f7813cd60e8c965d62

MASSIVE wall at 14.50, just as I've been strongly stating throughout this run. It acted as the signal to the upside on the left arrow, when we sold off it acted as support with a strong bounce, and again another test and won back.   
14.50 will continue to be acting as strong support moving forward, if we fail a test at 14.50 I would expect 12.10 to come.

Bollinger Bands are tightening again indicating price movement is imminent. This can be in part of the fact of the BB Investor Information Seminar tomorrow  
([https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/investors](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/investors)) 

### Baird 2021 Global Consumer, Technology & Services Conference

I doubt anything huge will be announced here but more information is always better.  
RSI looking healthy.  


https://preview.redd.it/iu895vv4e6471.png?width=1860&format=png&auto=webp&s=90999fa1816c8ea8283277413e0e09705172a2f7

Upwards wedge appears to be forming and lines up nicely with the Bollinger Bands. There will be movement either tomorrow or Thursday I am expecting a  20% pop to the upside.  
A lot of calls at $15 this week, expect to stay above this with all the strength and momentum BB is showing right now.  


Immediate resistance shows \~$17.20 USD. Acted as support in the January run on the 25th and 26th but now is acting as a strong wall. After $17.20, $20 is easily in sight.

  
Reducing my EOW target of $24-33 to $20-24, to stay conservative, though one solid piece of news tomorrow can make the difference.  


Volume is critical. Definitely has slowed down Friday Monday and again today but eyes are still on us. This is technically speaking this is great play right now, run up hard with a healthy pullback into a cup and handle. Strong baseline which is pushing higher highs and higher lows. Massive support at 14.50 with strong upside potential. Easy 50% gains if volume comes back  
Still extremely bullish.

Take care, and stay healthy.",DD,0.82
68,CLOV,nunagh,2021-06-07 22:53:38,$CLOV &amp; $DNMR Flash Buy Signals,"One tried and true method of deciding when to buy—and when to sell—is to watch the charts. Clover Healthcare (CLOV) and Danimer Scientific (DNMR) both flashed buy signals in the past few days. Both companies are the target of Short Seller attacks and law firms soliciting customers to join shareholder lawsuits. The good news is that both CLOV and DNMR are rebounding, and I think this is just the beginning. Both are well off their 52 week highs, and both have a long way to run.

One of the simplest methods for new investors to answer the question of when to buy is to watch the Simple Moving Averages (SMA). When the 5 Day Moving Average crosses the 30 Day Moving Average going up, it’s a buy signal. 

Using this method, AMC gave a buy signal on May 13th, when the stock closed at $12.98. We all know what happened after that.

https://preview.redd.it/6p6b9786ow371.jpg?width=1049&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf9859bdf9aae55e8c9789b566e21e2231460f85

This method isn’t foolproof. It will give some false buy and sell signals, and by definition you won’t catch the high or the low, but it will catch major up and down trends.   


**$CLOV gave a buy signal on June 3rd, when the stock closed at $8.90**  
CLOV also gave a false buy and sell in May, essentially selling it and buying it back at the same price.

https://preview.redd.it/7y4x7t5cow371.jpg?width=1049&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7350ae99bd09b9121e359dd44801208114c36cbd

**$DNMR gave a buy signal on Jun 1st, when the stock closed at $21.88.**  
Following this signal with DNMR, you would have had a false sell and buy signal in Feb and Mar, but you would have sold it at $37.90 on 3/25, preventing a long, painful ride down before it bottomed out at $15.38. Selling it at $37.90 and buying it back at $21.88 would also let you buy back more shares. 

https://preview.redd.it/n75xpi6kow371.jpg?width=1049&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5bae3f68eb5c966cf9fe8a9526d7d1b4fc64409a

Even with the occasional head fakes, this signal catches the long term trends up and down. I think it’s another useful datapoint to double-check your investment decisions.  
 

**Support and Resistance**  
 As another datapoint, both CLOV and DNMR are above most of their moving averages. CLOV is above its 30, 50, 100 and 200 day moving averages. DNMR is above its 30, 50 and 200 day moving averages, but still below its 100 day moving average.  
 

**CLOV**  
 30 Day SMA: 8.30  
 50 Day SMA: 8.19  
 100 Day SMA: 9.61  
 200 Day SMA: 10.55  
 

**DNMR**  
 30 Day SMA: 21.61  
 50 Day SMA: 26.06  
 100 Day SMA: 34.60  
 200 Day SMA: 23.90  
 

**Fundamentals are Strong**  
Both $CLOV and $DNMR have fundamentally strong businesses in the early growth stage. Clover is a small, growing healthcare company with proprietary software. Danimer Scientific makes biodegradable plastic resin, and is aiming to address the single use plastic waste crisis. I believe both companies have bright futures, with sales and earnings expected to continue climbing in the years ahead.  
 

**Short Interest**  
This isn’t the reason to buy, but it may be icing on the cake. According to Marketwatch, CLOV has 35.8% of the float shorted, well above GME (21%), AMC (18.93%) and BB (9.0%). DNMR has 15.8% of its float shorted. (I realize this varies from day to day and site to site)

**CLOV: 35.8% of Float Shorted**  
**DNMR: 15.8% of Float Shorted**  
 

**Summary**  
 I believe CLOV and DNMR have bright, promising futures, and I expect them to gain both short term and long term.

This is an extensive, in-depth due-diligence document, and I realize that “ain’t nobody got time for that”. So I have decided to do God’s work for him and put the tl;dr at the start, saving you all a couple hours read.

* Henrik Fisker is a God among men in the automotive industry - trust him to do right
* Geeta Gupta-Fisker is a solid Chief Financial Officer with experience in investment banking - she will ensure the shares are valued right
* Henrik has learned from all the mistakes he made with his previous attempt to create Fisker Automotive, and will certainly do everything in his power to avoid that mess again. He has designed systems into the intricacies of the company to avoid failure - meaning Fisker Inc is guaranteed to succeed
* Henrik Fisker on shorting $FSR - “You will quickly understand that you stand to lose a lot of money if you show it against Fisker”
* Production of Fisker Ocean expected to start in November 2022
* 250,000+ units a year expected by 2025
* Partnerships with Foxconn and Magna Steyr, both giants in their respective industries, among others
* Large Fleet market in Europe gaining momentum, and 700+ Fisker reservations in this market alone
* 16,000+ reservations already. More than Tesla had 18 months pre-production
* Revenue streams include leasing automotives, servicing, selling emissions credits, selling insurance (like selling the pickaxe to miners, and selling the diamonds to the mine owners too, absolutely genius - Fisker are insuring cars which they own, because the customer is only leasing it)
* High short interest (20%+), high analyst price targets compared to current share price (100%+) and low valuation compared to peers ($3bn market cap currently)
* Designing the first ever all-electric popemobile - Massive, soon to be historic, event!
* I give $FSR (currently $13 a share) a price target of $100 by end of year 2022, if not sooner
* Price Targets: $35 by end of year - Previous ATH. $50 start of next year - European and Chinese debut of prototypes. $100 end of 2022 - start of production (SOP). $150+ 2023
* 2025 Price Targets, calculated using projected data: Bear case - $97 a share, Bull case - $519 a share
* Downside in the short term is capped by the large amount of cash on hand - one third of market cap is cash. Long term, is capped by risk factors, which are almost eligible and affect every automotive startup anyway.

The Fisker Karma was the world's first premium [plug-in hybrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_hybrid), and received a handful of accolades, including the [International Design Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Design_Awards) Product Design of the Year, Silver [Edison Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edison_Awards), [*Automobile*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile_(magazine)) magazine's Design of the Year Award, [*Top Gear*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Gear_(2002_TV_series)) Car of the Year, [*Fast Company*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Company_(magazine))\*'\*s Innovation By Design Award, and was named one of [*Time*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)) magazine's 50 Best Inventions of 2011. Fisker was named one of the 10 Most Interesting People of 2015 by *The Drive*.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrik_Fisker#cite_note-jschultz-6) Goliath.com named him one of the 10 greatest car designers in automotive history, writing that he has created ""some of the modern masterpieces in the automobile industry.""

In 1989, Fisker began working at BMW Technik, the company's advanced design studio in Munich. His first project there was the E1 electric concept car. -  Henrik Fisker has been working on Electric cars since 1989, years before most people even knew about them.

From 1992 to 1997, he refined the Z07 concept car, which would become the BMW Z8 roadster, produced from 1999 to 2003.In 2016, at a press conference celebrating BMW's 100th anniversary, BMW CEO Harald Krueger named the Z8 as one of his three favorite BMW models in the history of the company.

In 2007, Tesla Motors hired Henrik Fisker to perform initial design work on the Tesla Model S electric sedan, which was introduced in 2012.

Fisker stated in 2018 that, with the growth of car-sharing, ride-hailing, and autonomous shuttles, he believes within 10 years private cars will be used for less than half of what they are currently used for.

## Fisker Automotive

In 2008, Fisker Automotive raised over $90 million from investors including venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. In September 2009, Fisker Automotive was awarded a $528 million loan guarantee by the United States Department of Energy (DOE). The automaker was one of four recipients of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, to encourage the domestic manufacture of electric cars. The funds were to be used to develop the Karma, as well as an affordable family-size plug-in hybrid car. The loan facility was frozen at $192 million in February 2012, after the DOE claimed that Fisker missed its milestones

In December 2011, just as the Fisker Karma was launched, its battery supplier, A123 Systems, recalled all batteries, followed by a second recall in 2012. A123 filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, leaving Fisker Automotive without a battery supplier. After selling approximately 2,000 units, production of the Fisker Karma was suspended in November 2012, in the absence of its battery supplier.

&#x200B;

Henrik Fisker resigned as chairman from Fisker Automotive in March 2013, because of disagreements with management about business strategy. Later that year, the company declared voluntary bankruptcy.Fisker raised and spent more than a billion dollars over its lifetime.The heart of Fisker’s business model was in that early deal with Quantum. The idea was to design a gorgeous car, and have suppliers like Quantum provide the technology because off-the-shelf parts from suppliers would help keep costs down.

But there were problems with this strategy: Sometimes, those parts had to be custom-made to fit the design vision, which resulted in higher prices for Fisker. Other times, parts were delivered late or, worse, faulty, but Fisker was locked in to those supplier relationships. Sources close to Fisker have also said that many of the parts were owned by the suppliers themselves, so Fisker didn’t own a lot of the internal technology.

The broker that raised funds for Fisker automotive, by selling their private shares, was Advanced Equities.It wasn’t until December 2011 and into 2012 that the more dubious efforts of Advanced Equities became clearer to Fisker’s hundreds of investors. The last few hundred million dollars of Advanced Equities’ fund raising for Fisker, starting with the D-1 round, was what brokers call “pay to play.” As Fisker was running into technical, delivery and political problems, its valuation was quickly declining. But the company still needed more money, so the brokers went back to its current investors and said: Unless you give this more, your current shares will be diluted and your preferred stock will be converted to common stock.

It was essentially a gun to their heads. This is why investor Wray sued Fisker in February 2012, alleging he was on the receiving end of this tactic. In his lawsuit, he says Advanced Equities sent him a letter dated Jan. 18, 2012, stating that he needed to decide if he wanted to invest in Fisker’s next round, and pay around $84,000 by Jan. 27, 2012 — a little over a week from receiving the letter. He also says that Advanced Equities assured him that he would have anti-dilution protection. According to the audio clip from Advanced Equities’ internal sales call in early 2010, Advanced Equity leaders say that the Fisker deal will “suffer no dilution,” and was “a dream scenario.”

That dream would soon end. In September 2012 after Fisker closed on $1.2 billion in funding, the bulk of it organized by Advanced Equities, the SEC charged the broker with misleading investors when it raised money for another company back in 2009 and 2010 (Bloom Energy). Advanced settled, agreeing to pay $1 million, and its co-founders were personally fined. Two months later Advanced Equities closed up shop.

Later, A123 Systems itself went bankrupt, causing more problems for Fisker. Fisker claimed that A123 Systems owed it $140 million, but a bankruptcy settlement reduced that to a paltry $15 million.

Then there was the just plain terrible luck for the ironically named Karma: Super Storm Sandy wiped out 338 of its Karmas in storage in New Jersey. The cars first drowned, and then caught on fire — salt water damage caused a short circuit that was spread to other cars by high winds, Fisker said at the time.

With all of this happening in public — and in a presidential election year — Fisker’s struggles became highly politicized. The company was mentioned numerous times in presidential debates and speeches leading up to the election. Republican nominee Romney called Fisker and other DOE-supported companies losers.

The company didn’t seem to invest substantially in technology innovation or tech IP, and seemed to spend a disproportionate amount on suppliers. For example, numerous sources have said that the company paid upfront for 15,000 of some of the parts for its planned 15,000 Karmas. It ended up only selling around 2,000 of the cars. It has also been said that Fisker paid some funds upfront to have BMW make engines for the 100,000 Nina cars it hoped to produce — in the end, Fisker didn’t deliver a single Nina.

Costs to build each Karma also creeped up because the company missed its volume targets, and because engineering had to change designs around supplier constraints. The company ended up adding $20,000 to its initial sale price.

Expensive hires may also have sucked away chunks of Fisker’s funding: Sources say that Fisker filled the upper levels of the company with seasoned auto executives from Detroit. At the high point of Fisker, the company had around 300 employees, plus dozens of contract staff. Bringing in a certain amount of the old guard could help a car startup ramp up quickly, and also impress potential investors with “industry names.” But those people are also used to big auto-industry budgets that included extensive travel and salaries — that’s the opposite life of a tech startup.

## Fisker Inc.

In July 2016, Henrik Fisker expressed interest in designing a fully connected electric car with autonomous driving features and an aesthetically pleasing look. He has pursued battery technology, and hinted at potentially reviving the Fisker name with a pure-electric vehicle using technology that nobody else has. Since then Fisker has talked about delays to the promised solid state battery technology, which he does not expect to be able to be produced in volume until at least 2025. Posing risk for competition from more scientifically experienced future solid state battery producers such as Quantumscape.

***Forbes:*** “Now he’s back–and three things are different. First and foremost, he has a vital new partner: his wife, cofounder and Fisker Inc. CFO Geeta Gupta-Fisker. Second, his Los Angeles-based company is public this time around, raising more than $1 billion in an October 2020 IPO. And finally, Fisker’s stock price, up 56% since its debut, has made both Henrik and Geeta billionaires, each worth about $1.1 billion as of Friday’s market close. The auto industry has seen father-son and sibling leadership teams, but Fisker Inc.’s CEO-CFO combo is the fast-changing sector’s first husband and wife power couple.”

Wealth isn’t the purpose of the new company, Henrik says. “I never got into cars because of money. (This shows he is willing to do what is in the best interest of the company because he is not motivated by money, unlike 99% of other CEO’s)

The couple sought a big stake in the new venture to ensure they can control its fate in a way Fisker couldn’t with his earlier company.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yzhded6pfw171.png?width=408&format=png&auto=webp&s=54b30259720cf853a8efeacf058f2f74315260b9

Henrik is an auto industry celebrity, but Geeta’s background is equally impressive. A native of India, she holds multiple degrees in science, including a Ph.D. in biotechnology from Cambridge University where she was also a Research Newton Fellow. From there, she started a career in international investment for Lloyds Banking Group, and then managed investments for a high-net-worth client for several years. (In particular, this is insanely important - Geeta **KNOWS MONEY**! She knows how best to keep a company afloat, organize its share structure, provide value to shareholders, etc. because she has worked in the industry before. She may just be the most important element of Fisker Inc., due to the financial experience she has. At every step of the way, she is likely to make decisions with one sole focus - increasing share price and value).

She met her future husband in 2011 when he was visiting London, just before things started going very wrong at Fisker Automotive. They married in 2012.

“When I left Fisker Automotive, all I had was my car,” Henrik remembers. “I'm in a different position, mainly because of Geeta. Because she cuts the deals.”

To get the new venture off the ground, the Fiskers invested the majority of their life savings–an enormous financial risk given the fate of Henrik’s prior company. Then, just as they were locking in plans for the IPO back in July, they were hit by a highly unwelcome complication: Geeta learned she had early-stage breast cancer.

“She got the call (from her doctor) during a call with investors,” Henrik says. Despite that bombshell, she continued working with banks and investors in the weeks that followed, even as she underwent two surgical procedures and radiation therapy. Her medical therapy concluded in November.

Henrik, who marvels at her fortitude throughout the health crisis says, “she only missed something like one day of work...That's just how she is. She works tirelessly.”

## Fisker Ocean

The Fisker Ocean will have a nearly 300-mile range with an 80 kWh battery and a solar panel roof as a range extender, adding approximately 1,000 free miles of range per year. Advanced electronics will be housed under the hood, and the vehicle will incorporate recycled and sustainable materials throughout. Deliveries of the Ocean are scheduled to begin in 2022.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s87j6bdsfw171.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=e40add9ce53319d31db242cce73a303afb03cbab

Fisker has also announced a partnership with Electrify America to ensure Fisker Ocean vehicles will integrate seamlessly with Electrify America charging stations when the e-SUV hits the market. With features such as a solar roof and recycled inner materials, it will be, according to Fisker Inc., the ""world's most sustainable vehicle.""

In 2017, Fisker Inc. announced that it had filed patents on flexible solid-state battery designs. Fisker expected the batteries to be produced on a mass scale around 2020. A prototype of the battery debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. In October 2018, Fisker announced new funding for battery development through Caterpillar Venture Capital. The solid-state batteries are intended to deliver longer vehicle range and faster charging times.

In 2018, Fisker was named to the board of directors of First Cobalt, a North American cobalt refinery that produces battery materials.

In September 2019, it was announced that Fisker Inc. was partnering with Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who will serve as a partner and sustainability adviser to Fisker, to work on advanced, affordable, electric mobility models.

&#x200B;

[In addition to being a well-known actor, Coster-Waldau is also the United Nations Development Program Goodwill Ambassador for climate change and other social issues.](https://preview.redd.it/3hssff5vfw171.png?width=451&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebe55e2468c5b63d1bc0ac3c71547219dff5afaa)

Nikolaj wrote this piece about Fisker:

To quote a friend of mine who is a lot smarter than me, architect Bjarke Ingels: “The idea that sustainability needs to sacrifice quality of life is a flawed one. It’s a design challenge, a challenge to build something that transforms the idea of sustainability into something that will increase the quality of life for all those around it.”

One person meeting that challenge is Henrik Fisker, who has designed some of the most iconic cars over the past decades for BMW and others, like the BMW Z8, Aston Martin DB9 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage. He’s a hero for gas-guzzling supercars. He is a fellow Dane, I am a fan, and we met, of all places, on Twitter.

When we met in person, he described his new project — an all-electric luxury SUV — and asked me if I would help spread the word on his car. The problem as I see it with most electric cars is that they only accomplish the basics. They get you from point A to B. They run electric so you don’t pollute while driving, but that’s it. They are basically unattractive combustion engine cars that have a battery thrown into them — and for most of them, a battery with a limited range. What Fisker does is to try to make every part of the car in a sustainable and attractive way, like a full-length solar roof, recycled floor mats and vegan leather seats. It looks incredibly cool and inviting, with a great 250- to 300-mile range, and at a cost of just under $40,000, it’s a luxury car affordable to a mass market.

I said yes and even became an investor, not only because it’s a great car but more importantly, I hope and believe it can inspire other companies to actively incorporate sustainability goals into all aspects of their business. Fisker then had the idea of calling me “sustainability” adviser. Which I am not. Just to be clear. Thanks Henrik, sounds cool, but I am an actor and a citizen, and that’s really it.

And what about Hollywood? Is our industry changing, are we at the forefront? Looking at social media, you would think so. And things are happening, but usually only when a camera is pointed at people. Remember a few years back when all awards shows only used EVs for the red carpet? We made a difference. We mattered. We showed the way. So cool. So green, so … brief. Now it’s back to the Escalade. But hey, we are not using plastic straws anymore!

To believe that change will come from Hollywood is not really based in reality (when did that stop us?), but we are great at reacting — and things around us are changing, and changing us. I have a good friend who loves his SUV. It’s not electric. But he cannot give up his car. He is a good guy, he’s works for the U.N., so if he has a problem going electric, we all do. But if he is presented with an alternative that doesn’t mean a reduction in his quality of life, something like the Fisker SUV, I think he’d transition to electric in a heartbeat.

The IPO deal values Fisker Inc at US$2.9 billion, with an IPO share price of $10.

On July 30, 2020, Fisker announced plans for a four-vehicle portfolio by 2025. The Fisker Ocean SUV will be joined by a sports sedan based on their previously announced Fisker Emotion concept, a coupe-like SUV, and a lifestyle pickup truck. All will be electric vehicles.

On October 15, 2020, Fisker Inc announced it would be outsourcing vehicle production of its Fisker Ocean electric SUV to Magna Steyr, to reduce the complexities and costs related to the building and operating its own factory. Magna will start building the Fisker Ocean in Europe in 2022.

## Henrik Fisker Interview quotes:

I have people on Twitter saying, “Why don’t you just make the car next month? You have a prototype.” Most people don’t understand that it takes 18 months to do long-lead body tooling for high-volume vehicles. Most people don’t understand it takes two years to do durability tests and do all the engineering certification and everything else.

And on the business model itself, I believe that there is nobody in the near future or the next couple of years that’s going to make a million EVs on one model. Today, there’s nobody doing it. Tesla probably has the highest volume of one single model, a couple hundred thousand. But even the big giant established carmakers are not making, right now, a couple hundred thousand vehicles of one model. So the way you get volume, in my view, is if you partner up with other OEMs and share some of the expensive parts of the platform, which in my view is not anymore something that is unique IP or something that is a unique experience to the customer. An aluminum stamped floor or a steel stamped floor really doesn’t have any brand value anymore.

And obviously, as we move forward, we always start to do some of the things ourselves. But it was really about de-risking in our first vehicle to market. So we’re going to do another three vehicles, which we can do because we don’t have to spend all our money and effort on learning how to manufacture a car, for instance.

So we have programmed a lot. We have hired a head of ESG, environmental and social governance, and he is really spearheading developing specific... we kind of put out some goals that we would like to reach with suppliers, and we at least try to bring them in that direction. They are not reaching those goals right now, but they may reach them later. And then we have goals for ourselves. So for instance, we look at transport. Are we choosing a supplier that’s closer to the plant, or are we choosing a supplier that’s on the other side of the planet that way we have to then transport all that stuff. So those are the types of things that we’re really thinking about now as we’re nominating suppliers. And finally, materials as well, looking at sustainable materials. We’ve actually picked up a lot of knowledge on that side as well, where we are adding more sustainable materials to our vehicle. So we are actually looking across everything — supply chain, where the suppliers are located, what the suppliers are doing for sustainability, and also then of course in the vehicle itself — in terms of the type of materials there.

80,UWMC,nayxtm,2021-05-12 22:45:25,UWMC and What's Happening: An Explanation of Rule 10B,"Hello, so as you can imagine UWMC flew to the moon on a day where the market shit the bed. So, what happened? We're seeing the beginning of a huge squeeze in the very early stages. I'm just going to go through a factual explanation and some numbers.

On the earnings call yesterday, the CEO of UWMC (Matt Ishbia) stated that they would start the buyback starting tomorrow pending the rules.

What rules are there for stock buybacks? Well, the relevant one is Rule 10B, and they regulate stock buybacks. Why is this important?

Well, UWMC had an over 15% short interest, and that was recorded for April 30th. After RKT's earnings on the 5th, and LDI's on the 3rd of May, and looking at UWMC's share price tank after these two reported earnings... We can well imagine that the short interest increased since then.

Let's discuss what's going on then first shall we. Rule 10B is a safe harbor provision for stock manipulation in regards to buybacks, and if you follow them you're generally safe. One of these requirements is in regards to how many shares you're allowed to purchase on a given day. That number is 25% of the average daily volume. The average moving volume for UWMC right now is 5.64 Million, which means that UWMC could have bought up to 1.41 Million Shares worth of Stock.  Volume today was 8.91 Million. That means that there could have been up to an extra 3.27 Million Shares of additional volume? My guess is that it's a mix of hedge fund bulls who smell blood in the water, and momentum traders from WSB or more generally.

What does that all mean however? Well, usually there is volatility crush after Earnings, but UWMC remained highly volatile after earnings with a IV above 100%. That, combined with the massive amount of buys today means that the interest rates to borrow shares have mooned from 3-5% to 34.9% per annum. That's a huge increase. However, the shares available to short according to IBorrowdesk has actually gone down significantly. What that means is that the shorters are still in the game, so to speak.

Some of you are wondering what happened from 3:45PM onwards, and there's actually an explanation for that too, and it's rooted in Rule 10B.   Under Rule 10B companies with higher average trading volume or public float value can trade until the last 10 minutes. The shorters in the stock thus felt safe enough to borrow more shares to try to bring down the shares. If you see on IBorrowdesk the available shares went down from 2,000 to 800, before bouncing back to 3,000. So someone drove the stock down, then covered slightly or his position completely.

So, what's going to happen now? The short percentage is still sky high, and they haven't budged. Well, here's the thing. The public float is 110 Million, but of that there is a decent percentage that are institutional buyers. UWMC can buy up to 1.41 Million of that a day (which costs them only 9 million dollars a day!), and as the daily moving average moves up, they can start buying more and more. Those shares are retired, and thus cannot be bought back by shorters to cover. Furthermore, there are institutional buyers, and sophisticated traders who will want to get into the action (conceivably) because they see the way this is going. Finally, the ex dividend date is June 10th and if they refuse to cover their liable to have to pay the dividend to the owners of the shares. Finally, interest rate will continue to skyrocket upward pressuring them to cover or else get liquidated. At 2% a year, shorting UWMC even with its dividend was feasible, but to short UWMC with a 100+ interest rate is going to just destroy them. Especially when they additionally have to cover the shares they sold short.

In conclusion, the match has been lit (in my opinion), and the fuse will blow sooner or later. One one hand, UWMC retiring shares, and on the other hand, buyers driving up the price and then holding.

Edit: This also means that UWMC can squeeze the shorters with a buy back, while maintaining inclusion in the Russel by the way!",Discussion,0.83
81,AMC,nnriwg,2021-05-29 18:55:02,AMC Volume Price Analysis,"  

Hey fellow traders. Today, l’ll present to you a very strong bull case on AMC that is not explained by simply putting a rocket emoji (I love this emoji by the way) or because someone else posted a strong YOLO bet on the stock. Here is my analysis based on volume, price action, and a powerful pattern named the flag, high and tight.

&#x200B;

[Weekly chart](https://preview.redd.it/5bruexp383271.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=f679d9584a983071eaf036df2e4c5be14069eaae)

Firstly on the weekly chart, we see a high tight flag that started developing from the low on January 5th at $1.91 (#1) to the high of the pattern which was achieved on January 27th at a staggering price of $20.36 (#2). In 17 trading days, the stock soared 1065.96%. It’s an understatement that this price action caught my attention. The following months saw the stock consolidate in a flag, high and tight on falling volume. Bulkowski studied this pattern extensively and it’s one of his favorites. HTF is characterised by a rise of at least 90% (aim for double) in less than 2 months followed by a consolidation period on ideally falling volume. I think we easily meet these criteria! The performance rank of this pattern in his work is 1 on 23 in a bull market (1 being the best) with an average rise of 69% and throwbacks happening 54% of the time. Price meets target 90% of the time. The measure rule helps us acquire a potential price target for this trade. In his work, Bulkowski tells us to measure the rise and project it 50% past the breakout point. With the measure rule, using the breakout point at $12, we would have a theoretical price target of $63.96 (1065.96/100/2\*12)). Now to the analysis based on volume and price.

On the weekly chart, we have the breakout on #3 with rising and above average volume. This confirms the breakout is not fake, but supported by the professionals. After the minor pullback, we see the momentum exploding and the price action ripping past $20 on very high volume. Like we will see on the daily chart, the last trading day of the week saw some heavy selling which can be seen with the long upper wick on the weekly chart. 

I attribute this to two things. First, the stock rose to overbought levels and a pullback was imminent. Two, the stock hit the ATH of around $35 and many market participants saw this as a good point to take profits.  While it is true the SI rose in this period, I do not believe shorts created this long upper wick. Seems more likely professionals were taking money off the table. This being said, I do not think we are witnessing a trend end since strong momentums like this one cannot be broken in a single day. Like a big cargo ship, it cannot be stopped simply by turning off the engine. More effort will be necessary to break this rocket for sure. On top of that, the most conservative assessment would bring us to $63.96 in less than 30 days (around June 10th) following the breakout and we have a 90% chance of hitting this target according to Bulkowski. If these are not good odds, I don’t know what is. I truly believe this is an opportunity of a lifetime!

&#x200B;

[Daily chart](https://preview.redd.it/wslu122983271.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a1d2f718d41538d8bfad7ffad44ade99c796356)

On the daily chart, we can see the flag, high and tight develop from January 27th on #2 to the breakout at #3 on May 13th. Developing this cause is important according to Wyckoff’s law of cause and effect. The development of a cause will be proportional to the subsequent effect. On May 14th (breakout day (#4)), we see rising and above average volume that confirms the start of a new trend. Then, the test of supply on the pullback at #5, we see falling volume until the stock reaches $12 which means there is no interest in selling at these prices. The rally resumes on very nice long white candles on steadily rising volume which means volume and price are in harmony fully supported by the great professionals. 

On the second to last candle, we see some selling happening as shown with the upper wick. On #6, we see a tall black candle that closes very close to the prior day’s close. I associate this candle with the bearish meeting lines candle. Bulkowski’s work establishes the candle to be a continuation pattern 51% of the time in a bull market, which is pretty much as valid as a coin toss. If the next day’s close is below this candle, Bulkowski tells us there is a 70% chance the candle acts as a reversal. So this is to be looked at closely for next week. The long upper wick and shorter lower wick associated with very high volume tells me there was more selling happening Friday by the professionals. 

We must remember that stocks do not trend in a straight line. Volatility is cyclical, and all this is normal price action. Even in the event that Friday’s price action is stopping volume by the great professionals and the beginning of a distribution phase, Wyckoff’s work tells us this is associated with a potential preliminary supply and this stopping action ALWAYS fails and thus the rally WILL continue. Ladies and gents, I cannot stress enough how AMC is trading currently at a discount and any entry point is a good one at this point in time. We do not choose our seats on a rocket ship! You get in, strap on, and enjoy the ride! Trying to perfectly time the bottom on any pullback is a fool’s errand! Looking back at the daily chart on AMC, #1 (hanging man) and #3 (dark cloud cover) shows us that any bearish candle in the recent history of this stock is likely to be very short lived. Shorting this stock based on the bearish meeting lines (weak bearish candle by the way) would be a very dangerous endeavour indeed.

&#x200B;

[30 minutes chart](https://preview.redd.it/erdc846b83271.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ec91557abfecf685c4af681eaf68f0da6a1fd9b)

Lastly, on the 30 minutes chart, friday we see at #1 strong buying pressure as seen with the long lower wick and high volume at $25.50. #2 was a retest on falling volume meaning falling interest to sell at this price. I do believe we have strong support at this level.

No one has a crystal ball and this could go either way, but the odds are that we reach $63.96 by the end of June with a 90% probability according to Bulkowski. I am adding to my position at any dip in this stock. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qbs706tc83271.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=8669186d98ef0792b216b50992969cd1d08fe785

If history is of any guide, I expect AMC to have a short consolidation period with falling volume like we saw with GME before the great run up. Thus, I believe we have another week to add to our positions before this really takes off. Any close above 35$ will be extremely bullish

I’ve been reading many posts explaining the short squeeze potential and this adds to the excitement of a strong bull run in this stock way past $63.96. AMC is currently the most shorted stock in the market as we speak. Though I have doubts that AMC will reach 500k like many claim, I do believe we have a strong squeeze potential in this stock as shown by the candles and volume recently printed on the charts. Ultimately, volume and price will tell us when it is time to close our positions.

Cheers,

20$ 07/16C AMC

30$ 07/16C AMC

Edit: Just to be clear, Bulkowski’s HTF gives us a 90% chance to hit the target in the next 30 days after the breakout. This target is his CONSERVATIVE target not MY target. I do NOT plan to sell at this target. I have no price target at this time since it could squeeze to 10k for all I know. More price action is needed to accurately assess a higher target.",Technical Analysis,0.91

83,OG,nr3jmz,2021-06-03 05:13:40,Rite Aid ( $RAD ) : One of the Next Meme Stocks to Soar is a Former WallStreetBets OG Favorite,"As meme stocks continue to melt up higher, an old meme favorite from the past is ready to join in on the fun --- That stock is Rite Aid ( RAD ).

**Some Basic Information**

* Rite Aid has only 55 million shares outstanding. Of those, approximately 57.75% are held by institutions and insiders.
* There are 7,860,000 million shares short or about 14.3% of the total outstanding shares. Those familiar with RAD know that it has been a target of short sellers for years who have tried desperately (but failed) to push the company into bankruptcy.
* The company had annual revenue of $24 Billion last year and is projected to hit $25 Billion this year.
* Despite having $24 - $25 Billion in annual revenue, Rite Aid's market cap is barely above $1 Billion.
* The stock price broke above $20 per share on June 2, 2021. The 2021 high share price thus far is $32.48, achieved back in January.
* The company is expected to turn the corner this year and report positive net earnings for the full fiscal year.
* The long-term debt is approximately $3.1 Billion
* Rite Aid achieved positive free cash flow last year and will do so again this year.
* Earlier this year, RAD completed an acquisition of Bartell Drugs for just under $100 Million, making Rite Aid the #1 pharmacy in Seattle.
* Rite Aid is the #3 retail pharmacy in the USA behind CVS and Walgreens.
* In 2018, Walgreens acquired 1,923 Rite Aid stores for $4.4 billion in cash. Rite Aid now has more than 2,500 retail stores today.
* Some analysis done on Rite Aid has projected that the breakup value of the company is in the range of $39 - $50 per share. (example - [https://www.reddit.com/r/RiteAidInvestor\_RAD/comments/m7haju/rite\_aid\_no\_matter\_how\_you\_cut\_it\_it\_is\_the\_right/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RiteAidInvestor_RAD/comments/m7haju/rite_aid_no_matter_how_you_cut_it_it_is_the_right/) )

**Impact of Coronavirus Vaccination Program and Future Contribution of Other Vaccines**

One significant contributor to Rite Aid’s financial improvement on the current fiscal year results will be the coronavirus vaccine distribution program. Rite Aid is an official participant in the US government’s Federal Retail Pharmacy Program for COVID-19 Vaccination. The US government dramatically increased the reimbursement rates for pharmacies administering the coronavirus vaccine to $40 from $28 for a single dose.

At the rate of vaccination projected, it is fair to estimate that Rite Aid will administer approximately six (6) million doses of COVID-19 vaccine during the first half of its 2022 fiscal year alone. Using the government reimbursement rates, the six (6) million doses will likely generate $230 million in revenue for Rite Aid and contribute approximately $2 per share in net profits. While the initial vaccination program will likely be completed during Rite Aid’s fiscal first half, the COVID-19 vaccine boosters are likely to become an annual revenue / profit stream for Rite Aid, as the annual flu vaccine is today. The latest view from epidemiologists suggests that annual coronavirus booster shots will likely be required on an annual basis. The global spread of coronavirus variants such as the E484K mutation lend credence to this view. Furthermore, customers visiting their local Rite Aid for COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters will become aware and take advantage of the fact that the retailer also offers nineteen (19) other vaccines, including flu, pneumonia, chicken pox, HPV, hepatitis A & B, and meningitis among others. As a result, vaccine distribution will continue to play a role in Rite Aids retail pharmacy growth story.

Finally, with the rapid development of mRNA vaccine technology to address the COVID-19 pandemic, we can expect to see new vaccines hit the market to prevent a variety of different types of cancers and other life-threatenting / chronic diseases. Such vaccines would be added to the list administered by pharmacists at local retail stores such as Rite Aid, increasing the revenue and profit potential of such establishments.

**Potential for RAD to Be Acquired**

While Amazon is often mentioned as a suitor for Rite Aid, I actually believe that the highest probability of a buyout of Rite Aid would come from Walmart.

Walmart is already a leading player in the retail pharmacy / prescription drug segment, and the category is a strategic growth target for the company. However, Walmart has nowhere near the presence in the pharmacy sector of either CVS or Walgreens. In order for Walmart to become competitive in this space, they have to increase their size and scale. If Walmart let's Amazon step up and become the third largest player in retail pharmacy, it's game over. WMT needs to move into this third position and block AMZN from doing so.

A couple of the benefits of Walmart acquiring Rite Aid would be:

* Walmart would have double the purchasing power for prescriptions thereby lowering its overall drug cost, improving profitability
* All the goods sold in the front-end of the 2,500+ Rite Aid retail pharmacies are the same products Walmart sells in its own department stores. Once again, when you buy larger quantities you get lower prices. This is a fact of the business world that I know first hand.

Based on the above 2 points, Walmart would improve both its own existing margins and at the same time would improve those of the Rite Aid revenue through such an acquisition.

The Rite Aid PBM would help Walmart to capture much greater market share in the prescription market, thereby enhaning those gains even further.

If you look at Walgreens and CVS when they had approximately $25 - $30 billion in revenue, they were earning about $4 - 6 billion per year. Therefore, considering Walmarts expertise in running brick and mortar establishments, one could make the leap of logic that WMT would achieve similar profit levels. So an acquisition of RAD by Walmart essentially provides a 2-3 year payback on the investment.

**Conclusion - Potential for Share Price to Soar Higher this Summer**

Rite Aid is due to report its Q1 earnings for the current fiscal year on June 24, 2021. The stock is likely to rally back to its 2021 high of $32.48 as that date approaches.

Also, as meme stocks continue to soar higher, Rite Aid is likely to benefit from such market activity as well. With only 55 million shares outstanding, RAD could easily see an exponential run higher should retail investors once again take an interest in this former WSB favorite.

 -🚀Mexico/US P3 trials and Price outlook 🚀-
Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days probable, end of June worst case) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July-August for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent or close to Moderna.  Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects)  Chart on Contracts nvax has and what future prices/MC is expected to be is down below in the ""DD literature section"" at the bottom



-🚀 Intro to Protein and mRNA type Vaccines🚀 -
Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

             
                           
-🚀Differences how Protein vs.mRNA vaxs work🚀 -
Imagine if the whole spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize it to understand the whole picture, and helps modify your Messenger RNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates  one piece of that picture it can still recognize the virus due to being able to see various other parts of the picture. In the mRNA method using one portion of the picture as virus mutates,  it becomes easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine ... that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. .... And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein.



-🚀 Safety, Side Effects, and Adjuvenants  🚀-
 Every vaccine uses what's called an adjuvenant. This basically boosts the vaccines effectiveness. There's different kinds, and every company uses one in their vaccine. Not all are created equal. What makes Nvaxs adjuvenant (called Matrix M) so special is its the only plant based (soapbark tree) adjuvenant out there, and is the least irritating. This adjuvenant has been tested on pregnant women in the past and pases with the flying colors. mRNA adjuvenant vaccines use common molecules found in viruses and bacteria that stimulate our immune system. This approach has not been fully tested on pregnant women long term. One of the most common types that were used in the past were aluminum salts. They were found not to be ""harmful"" but we also didn't know enough about them and how they affect us on a grander scale. A lot of anti-vaxxers are against aluminum salts and giving it to the children. This is why Nvax will be the perfect solution for anti-vaxxers, children and the eldery that want something completely safe. Just using the term plant-based in a vaccine adds a good connotation, let alone the stronger protection/immune responce it provides. As far as what the virus is grown in,  Nvax uses a moth based formula. So it's insect and plant-based. Sounds like the Karen's will love this! Ultra safe. 


Adjuvenants work by creating an irritation/inflammation at the injection site, This in turn helps the vaccines be more effective apon administration. This is what makes you feel sore after getting a vaccine and specifically amount of adjuvenate that being used.  NVAX only needs to use 5mM vs  mRNA type vaccines use anywhere from 50 to 100 mM of adjuvenant. Therefore when getting a mRNA type vaccines you get a much stronger side effect due to the large amount being used. This is proof how effective nvax is because they need to use so little to be to get a strong immune response. Hence why they have the best data and we're called a first in class vaccine. In conjunction with how much adjuvenant is being used you can also say it directly alters the safety profile. Use too much and you get too many bad reactions. This is why Nvax has one of the best safety profiles out there.Hands down 🙌 Bottom of my post is a link with a lot of the data charted out that includes all the side effects of each vaccine charted.


 Lastly because the amount of ajuvenant used in mRNA type vaccines can only fit one maybe two strains max before throwing off the safety profile and risking not getting approval.  If they do use two strains they have to use less adjuvenant for both to combine them, meaning you're not going to get complete protection for each strain from the vaccine.  Nvax does not have this problem because of the such small amount they use, they could combine up to five different strains without an issue.... And right now with it being so clear that covid strains are going to keep mutating we need vaccines thay can cover multiple strains and give full protection on each one. Sometimes one strain can cover multiple strains but depending on where the strain mutates, a bad mutation will require addressing each strain individually and putting them together in one vaccine. Since you can't get four strains in one mRNA vaccine this puts us out at a clear advantage down the road when people need to do booster shots, and don't want to get multiple vaccines through the year.  So all in all it's clear Nvax adjuvenant separates itself from the pack and performs much better then other kinds on Safety, Effectiveness, Coverage of all strains and convenience of less shots in a given year.


-🚀 Logistics and Storage.🚀 -
Nvax can be stored in a regular refrigerator, and can be left out to sit out in room temperature for a while while you're vaccinating people. A special ultra low temp freezer is needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers. This is a majority of the world, not to mention the intricate ways you got to handle it so increases your distribution cost because you need special warehouses, dry ice etc. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

                 
- 🚀 Scientific conclusion 🚀  -
So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). As of now Nvax elicits the strongest immune response out of any vaccine with the highest efficacy. Another thing that's really important to know is every trial is not built the same. Every company creates different end points for their trials. Some are looking for severe disease, some are counting everything mild, medium and severe. Nvax counted every single possible infection whether it was mild medium or severe. Case in point j&j didn't have very good efficacy in South Africa so what they did was they only counted the most severe cases so they could say that their vaccine works. (Great you won't die but you'll get so sick you wish you did).
 When looking at mild cases their vaccine didn't work very well. This is why it's always hard to tell apples to apples when you look at efficacy numbers because every trial is different. So you have to look at the devil in the details. 


It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines. This puts other competitors far behind us, giving nvax a economic moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing! They teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy which of P3 is the same it's good enough for approval). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine, and phase 3 is already complete and now they're moving on for approval. They will running a trial on their flu and covid combo vaccine, and once launched they could double the price of current covid vaccine due to being a 2 for 1. Moderna and Pfizer are also looking at a combo shot but they haven't even started trials yet. The problem is they can't even finish their trials because flu is non-existent right now so be very hard for them to get trials done for a long time. 



 -🚀 Investment Thesis & Financials  🚀-
Nvax is pretty much de-risked at this point vs where they were a year ago. Yes you could buy other biotechs that can go up 20x, but they are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up, generally takes years for companies to get to this point if not decades.) They have all successful trials, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment; where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place, there are no more issues or glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""

 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 


A link for future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract is at the bottom of the post in DD literature section. It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June, anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 



 -🚀My Positions 🚀 -
As far as my position I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $4.06, I panicked and sold once during February a couple months during the mini bear market and got back in a bit too early so got a wash sale as well 🙈 but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG  (Check out next link below this paragraph, it has My positions with the price chart mentioned above. My screen name on stocktwits is Johnnyknowsbest. Been on there and here since i started with nvaxz feel free and drop a follow if you want up to date info. But honestly the whole board is worth following there's so much good DD on there, we have a really strong tight knit group of longs that help each other with DD. 


Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO, where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June, but he said he thinks it could be earlier.  So sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

86,WKHS,nvy3hb,2021-06-09 17:06:17,$WKHS SI IS NUTS!,"So yesterday I was doing some research and found out that $WKHS has the highest short interest at 41.93% of its float (courtesy of MarketWatch data). This number is now 44.47% (courtesy of ORTEX), this puts it just one place behind CLOV which passed it yesterday. While I'm still not 100% certain on the longevity of the company yet until I see more progress, short term I think this thing has plenty of room to run in the current market. Also, this bad boy has seen numbers like $40+ and I'm confident if momentum picks back up this thing can get back up to the $20+ range.

Currently I own June 18th $17.5 calls in anticipation for this thing to blow the hell up. All this thing needs is more exposure and it will literally go through the roof. There is information going around the $WKHS owns 10% of $RIDE and that $WKHS should go down with it as well. Initially, I thought the same thing until I did a little more research and found out that $WKHS owns part of $RIDE through a licensing deal where $RIDE paid $WKHS $12 million dollars in exchange for intellectual property and 10% stake in their company. This isn't something that $WKHS paid cash for, its basically free stake in that company.

This stock is already the 4th most active ticker on StockTwits. With a little help from you fellow retards we could get this ball rolling!

MOON TIME! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀","Industry groups from Japan and Finland will conduct joint research and development of sixth-generation communications technology, looking to lead the creation of 6G standards in a field increasingly influenced by Chinese companies.

Finnish telecom supplier Nokia, a global leader in the industry, will join the effort.

Japan's Beyond 5G Promotion Consortium will sign the agreement soon with Finnish group 6G Flagship. The accord is to be announced Tuesday at the Global Digital Summit 2021, an event organized by Nikkei and Japan's Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications.

The initiative follows a [$4.5 billion commitment](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Telecommunication/US-and-Japan-to-invest-4.5bn-in-next-gen-6G-race-with-China) by Japan and the U.S. toward the development of next-generation communications technology, in a partnership announced in April. Extending the cooperation to ""third-countries"" to promote secure connectivity is seen helping in the competition with China to set global standards.

The Beyond 5G Promotion Consortium, which aims to commercialize 6G technology in the 2030s, includes the University of Tokyo along with major Japanese telecom players such as Nippon Telegraph & Telephone, NTT Docomo, KDDI, SoftBank Corp. and Rakuten Mobile. 6G Flagship is led by Finland's University of Oulu.

Members of the Japanese consortium will engage in joint research projects and personnel exchange. The group is in talks for future collaboration with an American counterpart that includes telecom supplier Cisco Systems and chipmaker Intel.

Shares of 5G patents owned by Japanese developers have fallen behind the likes of South Korea's Samsung Electronics and U.S. player Qualcomm. NTT Docomo holds about 6% of 5G patents, compared with roughly 10% for Qualcomm and China's Huawei Technologies.

The internal affairs ministry aims for Japan to command at least a 10% share in 6G patents together with a slice of 30% or more in equipment and software.

94,AMC,nw04kf,2021-06-09 18:35:01,$CLOV showing a similar pattern as $AMC and $CLOV prediction for this week,"Pattern:

I've been patient with AMC in the last of couple days with over $100k invested @$19. I'm starting see a familiar pattern with CLOV. I see a similar pattern with AMC's second day of rise and CLOV's behavior today. With an initial spike, both of these stocks all started with a high pre-market price and a cooldown throughout the day. Eventually, AMC showed this pattern for a day or two until it shot up for the last time before the short squeeze began. CLOV is still at an infant phase of a massive potential squeeze. The shorts are putting on pressure to keep CLOV low, but the counter pressure from retail investors are holding the stock and not give into the panic. Holding the line for a day or two will accumulate more retail investors, who are buying these dips. If CLOV is the next short squeeze play, it will surpass AMC in a heartbeat.

Prediction:

CLOV is a gamble play for sure. There is always a probability of short squeeze happening depending on many factors, like media and sentiment. However, CLOV was my next pick because the numbers showed me that it definitely had a massive squeeze potential, and I saw a familiar resemblance with AMC. High risk high reward.

If CLOV plays out like how AMC did, CLOV will close today with the resistance around $17\~$18 range. The next morning, CLOV will see a massive spike during the pre-market and cooling off for a bit throughout the day. Then CLOV would've stabilized around $20 and the shorts will start to get impatient. They will have to cover their shorts because they are not seeing CLOV going down anywhere close to $7\~8 again in the next couple of days. Thus, the short squeeze will begin. Once it begins, more retail investors will join in. With the options expiring on the 18th, more people will join in seeing a potential gamma squeeze. I can see this stock go to an unimaginable numbers if the pattern continues. 

This is a domino effect play. The first step has to be completed before moving onto the next. I believe that the first step is already completed, and we are at the second step, fighting against bearish sentiment. Third step is the squeeze. Fourth step is wait for the squeeze to stabilize, and the last step is to cash out the profit.

This is purely my personal opinions and not a financial advice. Seeing how big the wallstreetbets community is, a pattern like this is likely to happen again. At the end of the day, retail investors don't change their behaviors over night because we are not under any management or any strategy. The pattern will repeat.",Discussion,0.72

FUBO was caught in the Archegos drama and has had their SP literally crushed in the past few weeks.

Before the HwangBang there was a reporting error that sent the SP dropping into Gulag. The previous report didnt factor in GAAP and also did not take into account dilution, resulting in a dramatically high EPS miss. Even with massive sub growth larger than ROKU and NFLX they got their shit kicked in.

Now, the company has been in a ""quiet period"" for weeks, meaning they cannot comment on anything regarding acquisitions or any material information until the period is over per SEC rules.

That period ends in 45 mins.

FUBO is the number 1 sports streaming platform, and is rolling out sports betting in Q4, and has the most impressive sub growth of all streaming services % wise. Theyre introducing original content to offer alongside Live TV.

ALL analysts covering the stock are projecting $40-$60 and institutional buying is the highest ive ever seen in the last 2 months on any stock.

Theyre presenting at the Annual Needham Virtual Growth Conference on 5/17. Theyre edge over DKNG is that they can legally share all analytics they collect via their betting platform, which DKNG cannot do via privacy laws since theyre technically a 3rd party, whereas FUBO does it in house.

AMC has issued almost all of their shares (they've got only 46,124 shares left). And they will NOT issue any additional shares in 2021, according to them. This is good news, as it can certainly help the stock price to move higher.

They issued some shares today, and raised cash. For the company this is a good thing. They are well capitalized now. They asked for permission to issue 25 Million shares sometimes in 2022 - But we can talk about that when it is important, in 2022 their business could be a 110% again, and issuing new shares won't be necessary anymore.

This is the important part of their statement:

""As of today,  in our efforts to best position AMC for a successful recovery from the  pandemic, we have issued or reserved substantially all but 46,124 of the  shares that were previously authorized. ""

Its following what appears to be the exact same set up as last time. Small spiratic gains, then shorted heavily. Then its rinse and repeat until the shorts start losing ground. The last time the bears were this out of ammo was the last GME and AMC skyrocketed end if February. 

I'm getting deja vu. 

This stock has hit its tipping point today in my opinion by breaking through the 21 dollar wall. It appears that the shorts covered then reapplied at 21.20 which we just broke through again. This was exactly what was happening from what I can tell last time she gamma squeezed. 

Now with multiple stocks skyrocketing all in the same week, the hedge funds holding this down are extremely weak. RKT has been gaining volume the last week. RKT is a powder keg about to go off! The one major difference between this stock and the ""MEMES"" Is that ROCKET makes money, a shit ton of money.  

Now I understand that we dont have the dividend news we had last time. I get that. But I think with the continuing pressure we still see another massive spike in RKTS future!

Also T+35/T+21 elaboration.,"I'll start with the usual: I am not a financial advisor.  I do not provide financial advice! Everything following this is opinion/observation.  Much of my knowledge of the markets has been acquired through reading countless hours of DD posted by others.

OBLIGATORY - BuY & HoDl!

Now that that is out of the way, I would like to reference a few authors and their inspired DD that helped get me to this point.  The below have DD's that are a must read if you have not already; please visit their profiles and read their posts.  I will attempt to summarize the main points briefly below.

u/Criand:

[1)]**The flurry of rules before the storm. GME might be hitting T+35 and T+21 next week**

[2)]**Things are shockingly similar to the February 24th and March 10th runup**

u/myplayprofile - I am highlighting just one of their posts, but it goes into linear correlation which is now shifting to logarithmic correlation between GME & AMC prices.  AND he explains how there is the possibility that AMC is being used by hedgefucks to hedge their GME losses.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

This post is focused on u/Criand's DD, which enlightened me and many others as to what the fuck has been going on with the 21 day / 31 day FTD cycles.

Basically his DD over the last few weeks is the most accurate hypothesis that we have to date regarding the FTD cycles, and one of his most recent posts shows how this theory is now supported by the price action seen on May 25th and in the following days.

Key Points:

* He clarifies the confusion around why the standalone T+21 day FTD cycles, which have been shown to cause price surges, do not act the same way as they did during the $480 run and the $350 run.
* Explains how the Feb-March $350 run was caused by a dual event of T+35 & T+21 day FTD cycles occurring in close proximity to one another (back to back trading days)
* Notes that the Feb 24th initiation of the run up to $350 was exactly 10 days before we peaked at $350
* He references u/yelyah2 DD, which shows how gamma neutral spikes on day 1 of the $480 and $350 price run ups, returns to normal for about a week, and then spikes up massively again, initiating the January and February Gamma Squeezes

Below is my furtherment of u/Criand's work all in one concise graphic which feels oddly like a child to me right now.  Not sure if that is just because I have not really written any DD's before.

Please click the image to view it blown up and actually take in what is being laid out for you with my lovely computer crayons which I swear to god I don't eat... EVER.

[Transparent boxes represent the initiation of the combined T+35 \/ T+21 day price movements + 6 days \(because it has only been 6 trading days since ](https://preview.redd.it/v8tmo6hdi5371.png?width=1287&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a7e70813852641f29b2e57d8fc64ea7f7b83f77)

Notes:

* I am not sure why I called the $480 and $350 price run ups in the visual ""Micro Squeezes"", but thats what came to mind.  Perhaps gamma squeeze is more appropriate given u/yelyah2 recent DD?
* Yellow is micro squeeze 1
* Blue is micro squeeze 2
* Pink is the past 6 days

Alright folks.  I have talked a lot about other peoples work, and given you a graphic.  Now comes my value add.

Key observations:

* Not only was it a 10 trading day ramp up from the February 24th initiation to $350 on March 10th, but it was also **EXACTLY 10 TRADING DAYS** between the January 13th initiation to the $480 peak on January 29th.  My reason for calling this out specifically is that it strengthens the theory surrounding the combined T+35/T+21 day price movements, and helps us further establish that we could potentially go **PARABOLIC AGAIN 10 trading days from 5/25 on JUNE 9th.**  Will they be able to stop us this time?  Maybe it doesn't even matter if the do... See my next points
* In the aftermath of the January ""micro squeeze"" the Dec-Jan price floor of \~$20 **DOUBLED**, and the new price floor was set at \~$40 between Feb 5th - 25th.

Given that the price floor doubled and then tripled after these two events, **could we be expecting the new price floor of more than 3X $120?** (That would be a price floor of $360+ for those of you who needed help there)
* Edit to previous bullet: someone makes a fair point that ""We can’t assume that since it doubled in January from $20 to $40 and tripled in March from $40 to $120 that therefore the next floor must be more than 3x $120. What if the rule in the sequence is +20->+80->+140? Or what if +20->+80->+20->+80?""  I have included this just to explicitly state that my question **""could we be expecting the new price floor of more than 3X $120?""** by no means is intended to say the price floor WILL triple again.  I feel like this is a good point to say that this is speculation and theorization based on observation and nothing more.
* The MACD line has literally only had significant crossovers (golden cross) 3 times this year.
   * Event 1, Yellow ($480 run)
   * Event 2, Blue ($350 run)
   * Event 3, Pink (May 17th - today)

Additionally, I have plotted trend lines for each of the events.

* Event 1 (Yellow) we saw a 10 day increase of roughly 1,733%
* Event 2 (Blue) we saw a 10 day increase of roughly 770%.
* 770 / 1733 = 44% or a 56% reduction in 10 day price increase, although the price was starting from a floor of $40 instead of $20.
* 44% of 770% would be 338% starting from $120 which would mean a peak price of \~$405 in event 3, **IF** this short pattern continues exactly the same.
* THIS PATTERN WILL NOT CONTINUE EXACTLY THE SAME.
* I am only observing the trend of the current pattern.  The sample size here is literally 2 events, albeit 2 very unlikely ""coincidental"" events.  And I don't believe in coincidence.
* The pattern will break for many reasons, but the main reason is that hedge fund manipulation literally cannot continue forever.
* Once they get margin called its off to the races, and hopefully this event is the straw that quite literally breaks the camels back (Kenny G, you are the camel)

Oh yeah... forgot about this one.  LOOK AT THE VOLUME.  ITS LITERALLY FUCKING INSANE.  MEDIA IS PUSHING AMC, KOSS, ANYTHING OTHER THAN GME AND YET IT HAS RUN UP FROM $132 (April 13th) TO $290 WITHOUT A SINGLE TRADING DAY VOLUME GREATER THAN 21 MILLION.  WE SAW VOLUMES OF MORE THAN 150 MILLION IN JANUARY!

Alright guys.  To summarize.  We could be looking at going parabolic again on June 9th based on the pattern identified by the authors I mentioned above.  The price action and technical signals are bullish as fuck.

Ericsson to pay $97 Million to Nokia for after settling damages claim

Telecoms gear maker Ericsson [(ERICb.ST)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/ERICb.ST) has reached an agreement with Finland's Nokia to pay a damages claim of 80 million euros ($97 million), it said on Wednesday.

Ericsson said the settlement followed investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) into corruption, including the bribing of government officials. It settled with the DoJ in 2019 and agreed to pay over $1 billion in penalties.

The DoJ had [said](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-ericsson-idUSKBN1YA2HU) that Ericsson admitted to conspiring with others to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act from at least 2000 to 2016 by engaging in a scheme to pay bribes and to falsify books and records and by failing to implement reasonable internal accounting controls.

Ericsson said on Wednesday the settlement would impact operating profit (EBIT) by 80 million euros and cashflow by 26 million euros in the second quarter.

""The amount reflects uncertainty, risk, expense, and potential distraction from business focus associated with a potentially lengthy and complex litigation,"" it said in a statement.

The Swedish company added that the remainder of the settlement amount would be made in similar instalments in 2022 and 2023, impacting cash flow.

""Nokia can confirm that the information in Ericsson's press release is accurate. We have no further comment,"" a spokeswoman said.

Ericsson did not immediately respond to requests for further comment.",Discussion,0.91

However this is straight from the horses mouth from a Ford Dealership in Canada. They clearly state and clarify this partnership directly on their dealership website. Information I have just come across today.

[https://www.rivercityford.ca/xl-hybrids/](https://www.rivercityford.ca/xl-hybrids/)

What's more is in their latest today that have opened a new Centre in MI today again stating that it's where Ford and GM cars will become electrified.

[https://twitter.com/xlfleet/status/1402634437083471883?s=21](https://twitter.com/xlfleet/status/1402634437083471883?s=21)

I've been watching the level 2 for days and every time volume dries up it's being accumulating. In my opinion they are simply messing with the price.

If you want to read their investors presentation see below.

[https://xlfleet.com/assets/Uploads/PDF/Updated-Investor-Presentation-9.21.20.pdf](https://xlfleet.com/assets/Uploads/PDF/Updated-Investor-Presentation-9.21.20.pdf)

What a lot of people are missing about $XL is they have fingers in every sector of the EV market. 

They have substantial cash reserves of $400,000,000 roughly 1/3 of their market cap so there is no immediate requirement for cash.

**Please read full DD bullet points below:**

**Basic Stats:**

Market Cap: $1b

Public Float 94.4m

Shares Short: 22.11M

Share Float Short: 23.3%

32 days of consolidation at lows meaning an extremely strong base has been put in at this price. Everybody has been shorting during this period is now trapped.

Vanguard loaded up 6,000,000 extra shares with some other funds increasing their positions.

Possible entry into the Russel Index which would see far more cash flow into the name.

On the 26th March 2021 a total of 205,641 shares were awarded to employees at an estimated cost price of $6.81; With a one year lock up. Giving them a massive incentive to hit targets.

XL recently bought WEES in a 50/50 cash and stock deal which again in my opinion is a great buy. World Energy generated $18 million in total revenue and was free cash flow positive for full year 2020. Its acquisition, which closed Monday, is expected to expand XL Fleet’s electric vehicle charging infrastructure capabilities, the company said

XL recently inked a deal with UBS arena to provide charging stations, solar generation and energy storage. For a total of 1,000 charging stations which is one of the largest deployments in the United States.

The company they inked the deal with also owns another 30 properties. Meaning more contracts is a very likely outcome.

They also announced that to cover their current clients who consist of names like Fedex, Coca Cola, Pepsi etc they would need to install over 100,000 charging stations making them the biggest player in the industry.

100's of millions sitting in cash

Finally a Short Float of 23.3% approx 22,000,000 shares short. For a comparison this is more than $AMC and $BB.

The market cap and share float are so small that the room for an explosive move is enormous.

I'm personally looking for a minimum of Shitrons target at $60 a share and based on current future projections

This is of course not financial advice and I'm long, will be buying more dips.",DD,0.87

156,ACT,nn326f,2021-05-28 19:33:28,MORE ACT / CANNABIS / $SNDL &amp; $TLRY Potential,"What up peeps. I want to cover two tickers here, $SNDL which currently meets the sidebar rules with today's move. 1.6B market cap and is trading above $1. I get it mods, you gonna mod but I'll keep writing. The other is the infamous $TLRY.   


The News...

If you haven't read yet it looks like Federal Cannabis legalization my be around the corner. [Here](https://www.mpp.org/policy/federal/the-more-act/) is the House Bill. Supporters seem on board and like the reforms they have done to the bill including rescheduling cannabis. [Last time](https://mjbizdaily.com/key-us-house-lawmaker-reintroduces-federal-marijuana-legalization-bill/) the bill was introduced it cleared the House.   


Personally I think this gets a lot of support especially from a fiscal point of view. With stimulus stalling and a giant debate going on about how to pay for the stimulus I think cannabis offers the easiest way to collect federal revenue. A simple review of the bill and the fiscal benefits to the Fed's can be read [here](https://www.justtherealnews.com/congress/nadler-blumenauer-lee-jackson-lee-jeffries-velazquez-reintroduce-comprehensive-marijuana-reform-legislation/). The bill states a 5% fed tax. Money coming for uncle Sam, right when questions about paying for stimulus.... Personally I think it adds up, but that's for you to decide. 

Okay so that's the hype...

Let's talk about the tickers listed ($SNDL and $TLRY). 

$SNDL

I'll start with the cheaper YOLO, $SNDL. $SNDL short interest isn't high, but the company did issue convertible notes a while back around .7c if my memory is correct. I'm not saying they won't do it again, but they should be in a good place fiscally for now. Float is high with about 1.6B shares out there. However today's volume at the time of writing is over 415M. That's not bad given such a high float. It's about 200% more than the average volume. 

The options chain on $SNDL has me giddy. With over 200,000 options currently in the money on todays move above $1 there is some high potential here for some interesting action. The put to call ratio is just obnoxiously low at .08 it's screaming upwards betting. If we hold above $1 the potential squeeze up could be amazing.   


It's also broken up on the trend lines and out of the downward channel it was in. The regression channel from the peak squeeze back in Feb just broke out today according to my crayons I have laying around. 

$TLRY

$TLRY was the squeeze of a lifetime if you remember it back in 19'. The ticker was just a money printer with it's low float and stupid hype. Then they proceeded to do, like they all do, and issue debt. Shares tumbled since then falling from $120 --> $5. Ouch bag holders.   


Like all the cannabis stocks the Feb bump pushed $TLRY to above $60 in an amazing move. $TLRY has a lower short interest than $SNDL, but it also has a much lower float at about 300M. Compared to $SNDL the volume here isn't as good, but still remains decently above the avg volume around 36M as of right now. 

If we peep the options chain we also see a crazy low P/C ratio around .11. But we don't have the Open Interest in the chain like $SNDL does unless you roll out to Jun 18. Then we finally get some decent OI.   


Personally I am going with $SNDL. The option's chain looks better, the stock is cheaper, and the short interest is a little better. My advice would be to roll out till at least the Jun 11th $1 strike to not get eaten alive by Theta and IV crush. But WSB does what WSB wants and that's why I love you all.   
Do not go above the $2 strikes IMO. You will get crushed by theta unless we get an insane move, which could happen but I don't see the risk / reward there.",Discussion,0.91

159,GOEV,nvmz69,2021-06-09 06:16:01,GOEV a similar play to CLOV? Link to Citadel and other HFs,"So Citadel is a large institutional owner of CLOV with many calls (922000) and puts (429000) placed according to fintel, as well as 513,775 shares owned. My theory is they’re pumping CLOV to divert volume from AMC/GME and to offset maintenance cost on borrowed shorts/shares and keep maintenance margins up to avoid margin calls... but regardless, it’s still a nice ride to profit off. 

For those who missed most of CLOV, assuming it won’t continue skyrocketing at this pace, I see GOEV as an imminent rocket. At least one implicated hedge fund (sasquehanna with 1.16m shs) from GME/AMC ordeal is a large owner of GOEV. GOEV continues to be cheap buy, including option contracts. It’s where CLOV was at $10. BUT, it has actual baseline value and a history of being highly valued (>$24) - so ultimately a safer play as well.

165,DD,nw6lmm,2021-06-09 23:16:51,A quick DD on CLOV borrowing fee,"Since I saw a lot of misinformed comments in the daily threads, I figured I would share this information.

The current borrow fee rate for CLOV is 116.7% (https://iborrowdesk.com/report/clov). The borrow fee rate is not the short interest; that is the number of shares shorted. 

The borrow fee rate is the amount it costs per year to short a share, as shorting requires borrowing. To put it into perspective, for a costant price, a yearly borrow fee rate of 116.7% would imply a daily cost of paying 0.3197% of the value of the shorted share.

0.32% in the world of returns is a lot. 

Yesterday, the short interest rate on CLOV was 43.54% (https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1402368431291314177?s=20). This number might be lower now, as the borrowing fee rate depends on other factors (volatility, ease of locating shares) than just the supply available; shorts may have covered a bit. It will, however, not be a lot lower. What this implies is that for some 30%-50% of the number of shares available on CLOV, the shorts are paying 0.32% of the price of the share just for holding the position, every. single. day. 

The shorts are absolutely bleeding buckets. In fact, this situation, including the drop today, is incredibly similar to GME; I dare say even more so than AMC. Another great buy, support each other please.

I currently hold multiple call options comprising 19% of my portfolio, and that's only because GME takes up 60%.

Obligatory rocket emojis 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Edit: Since I made this thread I received a lot of good, confirming information, which I would like to summarize here:

- The short interest rate is currently at 50.42% according to Ortex.

- https://fintel.io/shortSqueeze model states CLOV is currently most likely to squeeze.

- questrade Canada also has a borrow fee of 59%.

- Additionally https://www.shortsight.com/ shows that CLOV has a bullish sentiment with a low share availability score of 4, meaning shares are confirmed really limited across the board. This means multiple brokerages are confirmed to have a hard time locating shares. That is huge. Remember what caused GME to not be allowed to be bought anymore? Borrowing fee rates were high for a ton of brokers, and some, including IBKR and Robinhood, had these high borrowing rates in place because they were running out of shares to locate. They could no longer provide the shares they are obligated to provide to those who either want to short or buy the share. And hence they shut both down, as otherwise the brokerages themselves would trigger an insane and instant shortsqueeze. An incredible indicator.

Actually, AMC was my inspiration for looking deeper into the GME chart - it had/has a **fantastic setup**.

[AMC TA](https://preview.redd.it/gju8synduwz61.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=46c863adbb144c04e3327bb212a79bb1633608fc)

Broke a massive falling wedge on the daily chart with a great increase in volume. It's also a cup and handle dating back to January. There was even confluence with key resistance near the breakout point @ **11.58.**

**13.24** is key support now, keep an eye on that.

We have been coiling under key resistance for a few days (**14.53) THE SECOND THIS BREAKS, WE ARE CLEAR FOR TAKEOFF (AGAIN).** Also - note the way we are coiling upwards below key resistance is a very bullish data point. Volume is declining as we chop up.

Price targets are **17.25 & 20.36.**

This is the best setup I've seen in this stock since the initial squeeze. Remember, keep it simple.

***TL;DR -*** AMC actually looks good for once from an **unbiased** technical standpoint

Not Financial Advice

Edit: Only thing I forgot to mention was the upper trendline of the wedge extends back to that 17.25 high - this is just another data point that adds to the validity of the breakout.

Remember what happened the last time a stock had borrow rates this high? Everyone seems to be bashing CLOV as a distraction from other stocks but to me it looks like after the price spike yesterday the shorts have doubled down on their position.

Since CLOV reached its ATH from the activity yesterday new short positions had to be opened in order for hedge funds to prevent further losses. The shorts are already under a lot of pressure as the share price is higher than any of their previous short positions unlike all of the ""tHE neXt BiG sQwEEz"" plays you retards have been posting for the last 24 hours.

Ok apes, chimps, gorillas, primates of all stripes... I'm going to level with you. I am posting this mainly because I want to throw one of my best ideas into the ring. But that's not the only reason I am writing this. I also want to inspire those of you who are just getting started in this game. For those who say that retail investors can't consistently make money in markets, I present you with some recent gain porn for your viewing pleasure. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gyvyzp0yln371.png?width=1355&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf56089ae7e9cff017cacdc546e9aa3c9e55f329

Look, I won't lie, making money investing is not easy -- lots of smart people are trying to do the same thing. But the real challenge is having the emotional resilience to stick with your thesis, and while not easy, if you stick to basic math and only invest in what you know, it is simple. 

As retail investors, we have a huge advantage over the big guys on Wall Street who need to hug the benchmarks, satisfy investor demands for quarterly results and invest only where they can expect to generate acceptable ""risk-adjusted"" returns where risk is bizarrely defined as ""volatility"", instead of permanent impairment of capital, which is how I see it. 

We can arbitrage these structural weaknesses in institutional portfolio management by making contrarian bets on stocks that are currently out of favor with the big guys, provided we've done our homework on the business and believe that it is undervalued. Eventually, if we are right about the trajectory of the business, they will eventually be forced to buy us out at a huge premium when the results prove out and herd mentality kicks back in the other way. 

I've made a nice chunk of coin on several positions over the last few years, which has enabled me to make bigger investments, and I am currently up materially on my latest portfolio positions. These are positions I have held for long time periods, with Bed Bath and Beyond being the largest position, the longest held and highest percentage gains. In my view, it also has the most upside, so I want to share a bit more with you about my thesis.

**Nothing I've said or am about to say should be construed in any way as investment advice.** **This is just me sharing my YOLO, with an explanation for my thesis.** 

Bed Bath and Beyond was a successful business when it first arrived on the scene, practically creating and defining the concept of Big Box Retail. As so often happens in life, their huge initial success bred complacency, and the co-founders (Warren Eisenberg and Leonard Feinstein) who continued presiding over the Board basically ran the company like it was their private piggy bank, without regard for small (or even large) shareholders. 

Under the leadership of Steven Temares, the CEO they handpicked, the business failed to innovate and keep up with basic changes taking place in retail -- such as the rise of e-commerce. BBBY began to see online giants like Amazon and even brick & mortar mass merchants like Target and Lowes begin to eat their lunch. Steven Temares, along with the rest of the c-suite, continued to receive huge salaries and bonuses, while the two co-founders received generous perks like personal black-car chauffer services, all paid for by the company -- and therefore, shareholders. 

They also refused to answer basic questions posited by Wall Street research analysts on earnings calls, seeing the investment community essentially as a nuisance to be tolerated but not proxies for the true owners of the business -- public investors. 

Well, the situation got so bad that finally, circa mid-2019 in the year of our chimp lord, a trifecta of activist investors led by Legion Partners (founder was trained by legendary activist Nelson Peltz) and John Duskin at Macellum Capital decided to wage war, buying up \~6% of the stock and filing a 170 white paper detailing all of the problems with how the company was being run and proposing to replace the entire Board of Directors and management team with its own slate of nominees. The presentation, which is phenomenal, is posted here:

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886158/000092189519001180/ex1dfan14a09050028_04262019.pdf

They went so far as to create a website for their campaign, [restorebedbath.com](https://restorebedbath.com/), which they eventually dismantled after reaching a cooperation and settlement agreement with the Board of Directors. This agreement effectively ceded control to the activists, who proceeded to replace everyone. It was a real Red Wedding style bloodbath... I mean total scorched earth policy... no respect for life. While it's never pleasant seeing people get canned, these people deserved it. After years and years of unaccountable shareholder abuse, someone finally came along and pulled out the game cartridge, blew on it and hit ""reset"" on the console. And they saw that it was good. 

In November 2019 they announced Mark Tritton, legendary Chief Merchandising Officer from Target who was the main person responsible for their massive success in developing private label / owned brand programs, would be taking the helm as CEO. Since taking charge, Mark has consistently been executing on the playbook laid out by the activists in their white paper, which basically calls for making low risk / high return changes to bring Bed Bath and Beyond up to modern retailing standards using well established best practices. 

While some would argue that a turnaround of this magnitude carries high execution risk, I would disagree at this time for several reasons: (1) The changes they have been making are actually quite well established strategies for modern retailing, with loads of case studies to pull from (Best Buy, Target, Lowes, etc); (2) they have the best team you could ask for implementing these changes (i.e., Mark Tritton and John Hartmann, who became COO of BBBY after a highly successful run as CEO of True Value hardware chains); (3) their compensation is heavily geared towards stock compensation, so **they only win if we all win;** and (4) most of the highest risk action plans, like divesting of non-core assets, culling unproductive / unprofitable stores, reducing bloated headcount and liquidating stale inventories at reasonable valuations, are all in the rear-view mirror. 

As of June 2021, Bed Bath and Beyond is at an inflection point with a strong focus on driving profitable growth from its core business lines. This comes down to a few very important strategies: (1) focusing on digital first, omni-always capabilities (leading with the website and mobile app but making sure they are able to serve customers however, whenever and wherever they want to shop -- think curbside pick-up, same-day delivery and buy-online pick-up in store aka BOPIS); (2) focusing on key destination categories where the company is seen as an authority in the home, driving preference for BBBY over other chains and even national brands by defining its key categories using data and developing owned brands to fill out their assortment in those areas (they have launched 6 so far this year, with another 4 expected by end of year -- ultimately they expect 30% of their sales to come from the brands they have created). This will help help them in multiple ways. First, the products are only going to be available at BBBY, so they are re-establishing their authority in the home and preference for BBBY as a brand and not just a venue to shop other manufacturers' products (this also means these items can't be bought online except for thru BBBY, so it is Amazon defense playbook 101). Second, these products have been strategically developed in areas where they had gaps in their assortment relative to the competitors they were losing share to. As mentioned above, development of these brands was informed by **data**, including detailed line reviews and purchasing data. Third, and final, these products are designed to cost and have very healthy margins that should improve the overall margin profile of the business as they are rolled out. This fireside chat with Mark Tritton from January 2021 explains it all far better than I can, and is well worth watching for curious apes: 

[https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/videos/a-fireside-chat-with-mark-tritton-president-and-ceo-of-bed-bath-and-beyond/](https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/videos/a-fireside-chat-with-mark-tritton-president-and-ceo-of-bed-bath-and-beyond/)

**So where does this all leave us today?**

The company has successfully implemented its digital first, omni-always capabilities, rolling out BOPIS, curbside pickup and same-day delivery (just signed up deals with Instacart & Doordash). Digital sales were up 86% in the most recent quarter and 99% in the Bed Bath banner (they also own Buy Buy Baby, which is the largest national baby retail chain in the US with the bankruptcy of Babies R US -- this alone makes BBBY an interesting investment with tons of hidden value).

For the first time in **years**, the company began posting positive same-store sales for the last 3 quarters under Mark Tritton (consistently comping up in the mid-single digits). This is a very positive sign of the changes taking place already. Same-store sales metrics are probably the most important data point for retailers, as it basically tells you if consumers think they have a good reason to exist. Quite frankly, it is an extraordinary achievement by Mark and his team that after years of declining same-store sales they are now positive for 3 consecutive quarters, and I don't think this has gotten enough attention.

They have also begun launching their new owned brands, with 6 already launched and another 4 or so on the way this year. These brands have a strong focus on their top 5 destination categories (bedding, bath, kitchen & food prep, indoor decor, and organization) -- I've personally purchased and used these products, and they are excellent quality at reasonable price points. I think they will do great.

They are repurchasing $1bn of their own stock (at least $375mm completed so far at an average price of \~$23 per share, reducing their share count from \~126mm to \~109mm.

Normalizing their revenues for divested brands and culling of unprofitable / lowest productivity stores in their footprint, management has guided to \~$8.2bn of sales and $525mm of EBITDA **this year,** with sales comping up in the low- to mid-single digits range for the next several years and EBITDA margins improving to high single digits / low double digits resulting in EBITDA of $850mm-$1bn by YE 2023.

Applying simple mathematics and established standards of value, I believe the evidence shows that businesses in this industry (big box and specialty retail) would typically be valued at \~8-12x EBITDA which would imply an enterprise value (value of the whole business, not just the equity) of \~$9bn at the midpoint, which seems eminently reasonable for an iconic retailer under solid leadership with about 1000 stores and authority in key growing segments of the US economy.

Since they have virtually the same amount of cash as debt, the enterprise value should be about the same as the equity value, so \~$9bn at the midpoint above. With \~109mm shares outstanding today, that puts implied equity value per share at \~$82, but where it gets even more interesting is if you factor in the share buybacks. They've still got $625mm of remaining authorized share repurchases under their existing program, and depending on how cheap they are able to buy those shares they could materially reduce the share count further.

**So why are the big institutional investors continuing to ignore this stock? Why does everyone continue to ignore the insanely cheap valuation and upside potential under the extraordinary new leadership of Mark Tritton, John Hartmann and the rest of the new team?** 

I can think of several possibilities, but probably the main one is a backward looking bias, because the memory of the old management team and their awful performance dies hard. Their prolonged period of value destruction also gave rise to a narrative, parroted widely by thematic investors and talking heads on CNBC, basically a nonsense theory that all brick & mortar would die and the consumer would only ever want to shop at Amazon (somehow ignoring blatantly contradictory evidence provided by Target, Lowes, Walmart, etc). 

In this excellent interview with burgeoning hedge fund manager Dan McMurtrie (aka Supermugatu), he discusses the reality of how Amazon is killing bad retail, not all retail, and how certain investors / the media have taken the the idea way too far as they so often love to do. **I cannot recommend this highly enough -- well worth watching beginning at 39:45.**

[https://www.realvision.com/unmasking-supermugatu-how-the-pros-find-edge](https://www.realvision.com/unmasking-supermugatu-how-the-pros-find-edge)

It might take some time for BBBY to shake off the worries created during the former management team's tenure. Most of the time, the stock market is forward looking, but in this case investors have adopted a thesis that has them psychologically stuck in the past due to PTSD, and the distractions in rear-view mirror are blinding them to what is likely to happen in the next 6, 12, 18 months. 

Eventually, I personally expect BBBY to shock the market with positive results one of these quarters, forcing a rapid, seemingly unexpected valuation revision in the stock. They have already begun to put up excellent numbers, if you look at the underlying same-store sales, digital growth, growth in top 5 destination categories, for example. However, there has still been a lot of noise in the numbers from divestitures, culling of store footprint, COVID impact in 2020, etc., and it appears that perception has not caught up yet with the new reality.

While I haven't focused on it much here, the company also has an excellent balance sheet with over $1bn of cash, no meaningful near-term debt maturities, solidly positive free cash flow generation & very high short interest.

Even with all of the prevailing negative sentiment, this has been a profitable investment for me so far (I purchased heavily in periods where others abandoned hope over the last few years). In my opinion, the company is probably worth about $80 / share as of today, however with continued solid execution and more enthusiasm coming back into the name, I could see this valued well into the triple digits. 

So, even with my sizeable gains I haven't sold one share and don't plan to anytime soon. I am holding this baby to the end.",DD,0.72

194,UWMC,neg3ey,2021-05-17 15:20:55,$UWMC - The Long View,"$UWMC has become one of the most hyped stocks in the online investment community. Online activity appears to be ramping up after earnings and heading into May 21st option expiries. Since UWM is getting a lot of new eyes, it seemed like an appropriate time to share why some investors may consider UWM as a long term hold. 

UWM is a mortgage company that focuses exclusively on the broker channel. It’s the largest wholesale mortgage provider in the US and the second largest mortgage originator, behind Rocket Companies. 

It’s CEO is Mat Ishbia, who started as it’s 12th employee and who’s dad, Jeff, started the company as a side hustle. Mat and his brother own 94% of the company in Class D shares. The rest of the public float, \~100m Class A shares, are what is available for the public to purchase. 

# What trends are pushing $UWMC’s stock down? 

**The largest threat UWM is facing is raising interest rates**: 

About 75% of UWM income is related to refinance activity. The pandemic pushed rates to historic lows so most consumers were better off refinancing. Millions have done that, leading to record profit for mortgage providers like UWM and Rocket. 

**The strength of the broker channel:**

UWM is completely dependent on brokers finding business and closing loans. It doesn’t have any direct-to-consumer lending operations like Rocket does. 

**Short Interest:** 

Sophisticated investors are seeing 75% of income potentially attached to rate sensitive products (not all refi’s are rate sensitive like cash out), and are salivating. They think the market is under appreciating this headwind and shorting the stock. They have basically shorted all the shares they can. Friday the stock ended with 200 shares available and an insane 93% borrow rate. 

**SPAC:**

It is true that the SPAC market has softened recently. It is very reasonable to assume $UWMC is a part of that softening. It may not attract institutional investors because of the SPAC situation and the short period it has been publicly traded. Lots of other nice places to put institutional money.

**Competitors:** Mortgages are a mature market and competition is fierce. Rocket, LoanDepot and UWM mentioned a pricing war in their earnings. (LD statement). This will compress loan sale margins in the short term. 

**What trends are pushing $UWMC stock up?** 

**Short term retail pressure:**

there is a lot of retail attention on the potential short squeeze/gamma squeeze you could see this week in UWMC. My post is about UWM’s long term perspective, so I’ll let [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ndcm0p/uwmc_is_a_powderkeg_low_float_high_short_huge/) take you further down that rabbit hole. Additionally, smart money is now tracking online sentiment, which can lead to increased institutional purchases. 

**Broker Channel Growth:** Mat has claimed two reasons for taking UWM public. He wanted access to the liquidity market and marketing exposure for the broker channel. For UWM to become the largest mortgage originator, Mat has targeted ⅓ mortgages to be originated by brokers and UWM to own 50% of that channel by 2025/26. Currently UWM owns 36% of the broker channel with brokers originating 20% of all mortgages. Before the housing crisis in 2008, brokers were 58% of mortgage originations (Per Mat & Q1 2021 Earnings call), so it isn’t crazy to think they could get back to ⅓ as it is growing: [https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum](https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum)

I had a loan with Rocket and tried to refinance with them. I then went through a mortgage broker and got the same loan for $4.5k cheaper in closing costs. This is because Rocket’s retail channel has 4% margins and it’s partnership network (includes wholesale, realtors, etc.) has 1% margins. 

**New Product Offerings:** 

UWM recently released new products like their jumbo loan. In earnings, Mat said he expects $2b in volume from Jumbo. They also added ARM’s, manufactured homes and expanded government programs. 

**Wholesale mortgage provider consolidation:** 

Mat said 3 of the top 25 wholesale lenders have been purchased in the last 90 days. This type of consolidation happens in mature markets by companies that are reaching for market share. THis could be a sign companies are under pressure to grow but cannot organically get market share from UWM. 

**UWM “All In” Ultimatum:** 

Rocket and Fairway are priortizing other channels (cause the margins are so much higher) and trying to squeeze out brokers. UWM said if you work with those two, don’t work for us. The goal was to stand up for the broker channel WHILE putting some pressure on Rocket and Fairway’s partnership channel. This may have kickstarted the pricing war. 

**Aggressive Capital returns:** 

UWM pays an annual .40 dividend on its class A shares. That only costs them \~$42m/year. Remember their Q1 net income was $800m+. So their dividends hardly affect the balance sheet. The board just approved a $300/million share buyback as well that will reduce share count. Mat knows a thing or two about shorting stocks. He just sold at $10 and has authority to buy back with the current price under $8. The man successfully shorted his own company. What a legend. 

**Long Term Prediction:** 

I’m invested in UWM because I believe the capital returns will be aggressive during the upswing and the company will remain profitable in a downturn. With a 5%+ dividend return, share buyback, and \*potentially\* growing market share, UWM could be primed to overtake Rocket within the next few years.

197,LNG,nt8spt,2021-06-06 01:56:31,Tellurian $Tell annual shareholder meeting this week and likely third deal announcement that could kick off Stage 1 LNG Export project construction! This is going to be a huge value play!! 📈,"I was updating my original DD post this evening. ([Original DD Link for reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/TellurianLNG/comments/l8aspr/tellurian_tell_long_term_investment_outlook_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) After doing the math, if we have deals with similar terms such as Souki mentioned, we need one more to hit the Stage 1 benchmark. Each of the recent deals is for 3 mtpa marketing takeoff. *We have a gap of 2.5 mtpa assuming Total sticks with their agreement terms or modify's slightly as the expectation was FID by June 2021.*

One deal released a week for three weeks, leading up to the annual shareholder meeting next week. It's perfect execution on PR leading up to an all-out celebration by the leadership team. Souki can give the 🖕 to the shorts, Total for selling part of their shares, and get started with construction this summer to build out the local infrastructure, FID, and then NTP (notice to proceed) in Q1 2022 with Bechtel. 💰

I believe the next deal will be with Korea Gas Corporation (KOGAS) or Sinopec.

KOGAS has the lion's share on their market and recent tweets about South Korea, Tell CEO being appointed to South Korea / USA business council. [https://mobile.twitter.com/TellurianLNG/status/1396127896939515906](https://mobile.twitter.com/TellurianLNG/status/1396127896939515906)

Sinopec recently signed their first long-term LNG contract with Qatar Petroleum for 2 mtpa. They're actively looking to secure future energy needs.  Let's do 2.5 or 3 mtpa with Tellurian and USA to have a larger contract than Qutar.  'Murica.

**Driftwood Project Stages**

|Stage|Plants|Capacity in mtpa|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Stage 1|Plants 1 & 2|11.0|
|Stage 2|Plant 3|5.5|
|Stage 3|Plant 4|5.5|
|Stage 4|Plant 5|5.5|
|Total||27.6|

SNK’s comment brings a great perspective on takeoff with Souki’s comments on mtpa being greater than Stage 1 alone. The overflow would start conversations about Stage 2. Construction of plants 1, 2, 3  could begin together.

&#x200B;

|Project Capacity|Percent of Assets|mtpa|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Original - Tellurian|40%|12|
|Original - Equity Partners|60%|15.6|
|Likely - Tellurian|58%|16|
|Likely - Equity Partners|42%|11.5|

&#x200B;

|Partnerships|Contract Type|Capacity in mtpa|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Total|Equity partner|1|
|Total|Marketing|1.5|
|Gunvor|Marketing|3|
|Vitol|Marketing|3|
|Total as of 6/4||8.5|
|Required for Stage 1||\-11|
|Remaining as of 6/4||\-2.5|

&#x200B;

Operating Costs on FOB (free on board) forecasts were mentioned around $3.50 to the water if I recall, which could be based on the project financing provided upfront through equity partners. Since the majority of the deals are from the marketing offtake, I assume the financing for Stage 1 will need to be secured by Tellurian via loans or infrastructure programs. This self-financing could put operating costs near $4.50 mark.

Project finance could be sourced by having a foundation of long-term take contracts with investment-grade partners. They list the credit rating of parties. With the recent infrastructure bill and the government's attempts at direct access to the bond market, I wouldn’t be surprised if bond issuance or infrastructure funds was part of the equation. Project partners such as GE or Bechtel could step up in agreements to provide sourcing. The majority would be bank debt. I hope stock issuance isn't the route taken.

Driftwood Stage 1 EPC contract costs $700 per ton. Lifted to $710 to adjust for market changes in 2019. I believe 1-2% lift is an understatement with current supply cost changes. I've seen a 5% rise in labor costs alone in 2020/2021 in my industry. Short term I would push closer to the 14% rise. That would be $98. This rise might not last the entire duration of phase 1 construction. I'll guesstimate $45. $745 per ton.

|Operating Costs|$/mmBtu|
|:-|:-|
|Drilling & completion|$0.88|
|Operating|$0.36|
|Gathering, processing & transportation|$0.79|
|Contingency|$0.22|
|Liquefaction|$0.75|
|Debt|$1.50|
|Total FOB|$4.50|

**Price Targets**

$1 just in asset valuation - Acquisition of Magellan Petroleum Corporation (Haynesville Gas Production Well) is valued $400M.

2021 - March/July = $4-$10 - Deals announced gap-up (3B valuation / 409M shares). $7.34

2021 - September or FID announced = $12 - 5B in capital in (5B valuation / 409M shares) $12.22

2024 = $37 at Stage 1 Project completion (15B in valuation / 409M shares).

2025/2026/Mid-decade will see a peak in Demand/Supply pricing where LNG company's valuations could get frothy.

Future: 40% capacity equals $70 a share

Future: 100% capacity equals $120 a share

Max would be 100B valuation / 409M shares at $245. Equity partners could comprise 60% of equity that would eat into total available shares.

205,DD,n9x2bw,2021-05-11 15:30:54,UWMC: My Final DD on UWMC in Light of Q1 Earnings and Guided Q2 (Though Prior to Earnings Call),"Righty-o. This is my final DD on the stock. I'm going to continue purchasing more and more shares, selling way OTM covered calls to be able to buy even more shares up until such a point as my cost basis is below the share-price (My average being roughly 7.5 right now), or the share price nets me a dividend yield below 5.5%. I'm currently wholly allocated to this, and that's why while it would be attractive at a 3% or 4% yield, I'm not going to keep continuously purchasing it. After a certain threshold is reached in regards to the share-price I'll just use the premium on covered calls, and the dividend as a backboard to purchase other securities at that point in time. Considering any shares I buy at 6.38 will net me a dividend yield of 6.26% yield, and the premiums on monthly options that are at 7.5-10 can range from 40 cents to 13 cents for that month for May 21.., I'm well capitalized to receive a minimum 15-20% annual interest on this stock while ensuring significant upside protection in that if my covered calls are exercised they would be exercised at a significant premium to my average cost basis.

T Stock currently has a 6.4% dividend yield. Look at it's balance sheet. Look at UWMC's. Then look back at T's. You'll understand why it's considerably safer to park your money in UWMC. The Payout Ratio for T stock also takes up the majority of earnings per share and by a strong degree, whereas UWMC by dint of its Class A dividend shares only being 1/16th of the shares has a dividend payout ratio that is essentially nothing at 41.5 million dollars a year.

Add to the fact that UWMC has just declared a 300 million share buyback, when the public float is equivalent to 693,000,000 and you see why I think things are going to change by dint of the fact the company is flat out going to be able to buy 43.2% of the float  of exactly 110 million shares. Considering that the dividend is over 6.2% while their senior notes have interest payments of 5.5%.... It makes complete sense for them to immediately start doing buybacks starting today, which is the day they are allowed to start.

Here are some of my thoughts after reading the earnings report please be aware that this was with the share price at roughly 6.5:

The Earnings Report was a decidedly mixed bag, and there's no two ways about it. Here are some of my thoughts that are additional:

1. The 49.1B in origination was a whiff, as they guided for 52-57B in originations. Gain on sale fell right in the middle-ish which was fine. I was right to guide for a little less or roughly 1B in net income, and if the salaries, commissions, and benefits hadn't increased exponentially 123,624 million they would have met right around 1B at 983,624,000.
2. I like they are guiding up as opposed to everyone else for Q2, and considering their miss for Q1 I feel they may even be being conservative so as to not disappoint again. One thing I didn't like was that their gain on sale margin was expected to be .75%-1.1% for Q2, but one part of that may be that they have an in-house jumbo program where they retain servicing which might compress margin. With that said, there is definitely a pricing war going on, and as the CEO of LDI said we don't know when that'll end but as he stated no one likes to sell something for ninety cents on the dollar, and we can expect higher margins when the pricing war cools. Please note RKT's wholesale margin is expected to be 1%.
3. I like that they are investing in "" Continued investment into machine learning and Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to further advance our operational excellence while driving down costs."" Margin expansion is key, especially since they already have a margin advantage.
4. I like that they have ""Continued to invest in our technology platform and on-site teams resulting in additional operational efficiencies focused on reducing costs, reducing closing times, and increasing loan processing speed"" since, again, margin advantage. I also like reduced closing and loan processing speeds.
5. I like that: ""Our continued investments in the cloud, as well as technologies that increase Underwriting efficiency, such as Automated Document Recognition and Optical Character Recognition, have strengthened our technology advantage while driving greater efficiency, and reducing both fixed and variable costs."" Ditto with everything else.
6. Their jumbo and government portion of both refinance and purchase are extremely low relative to Q1 2020 because they only turned the spigot back on them the latter part of March. This is probably why it's so low, and why they are guiding up. Remember the gain on sale margin for government loans are smaller than conventional though so that might help explain some of the margin compression. This should also help them Q3 and Q4.
7. The seasonally adjusted annual homebuilding rate is at over 1.7 million home as April. There is a 4 million home backlog, and to keep up with demand home builders need to build 1.2 million homes a year. It needs to be more than 1.2 million to start reducing the backlog.
8. RKT's share price was roughly 20 dollars when it announced its 1 billion dollar buyback and had a market cap of 40 billion at the time. UWMC's market cap is roughly 10.8B. So it's market cap is exactly 27% what RKT's was at the time of the buyback. But the share buyback is 30% of RKT's. So there is more bang for buck. Additionally, there was a 1.1B special dividend of 1.1B which equated to roughly 5.5% at 20 dollars. The current annual yield on UWMC is over 6%. What's more, doing share buyback will increase EPS, net income, cash flow, and the balance sheet as opposed to RKT where it will only help EPS. Therefore, there is strong upside to be had at this price point.
9. I like that their highest expense (employees) is variable and stands at above 2/3rds of their expenses since it's easy to downsize in times of hardship, or they can choose to maintain staffing levels but not replace people to leave for a natural deceleration of income.
10. RKT  is expecting closed loan volume of between 82.5 to 87.5B. That's a sharp decrease in origination volume of between 15.5% and 20.3%. This is an strong indication that the UWMC ultimatum knee-capped them. Please remember that the UWMC Ultimatum deadline was March 15, and Q1 is for the period ended March 31 for RKT. Please note that the Partner Channel isn't just wholesale broker's as they also lump other things in there like their correspondent (referral) channel there. I also found the 7.5% increase from 37 and something to 40 billion from Q4 2020 to Q1 2021 to be quite small regardless, but Q2 makes clear you can expect downward guidance on their Wholesale channel. Now, while UWMC may have won the wholesale volume war, it's paying a price. The entire wholesale channel is. While rates rising means a lower gain on sale margin, the pricing wars are cutting deep into gain on sale margin to. With that said, there is eventually going to be rationality as this cannot go on forever. No one likes to sell something for ninety cents when they can sell it for a dollar. So I call the gain on sale margin variable in essence. Finally, I expect investments to bear fruit and increase margin offsetting some of the pricing wars affect on GOS (for both sides to be fair).
11. I'm revising my expectations of 2-2.5 Billion dollars a year in net income to roughly 1.5-2.25 Billion, and I am being very conservative on the low end. I am calculating roughly 500 million in net income for Q2 2021 to be somewhat conservative. The way I am coming to that conclusion is by calculating a 49.1B origination for Q2 even though they are guiding for 51-55B (and considering the embarrassment of the whiff, and the new products they have on offer to increase capacity, I believe them to be conservative). I am also assuming a 75 basis point margin on gain on sale which is a touch more than 34% of the margin for Q1 2021. Under these presumptions they would be making 368,035,000 in loan production income. I am going to flat out live in delusion land and assume that Mortgage Servicing Income remains the same at 115,205,000 after accounting for the fact that mortgage servicing income minus change in fair value, plus gain on sale, and interest income equals that. That totals revenue of 483,240,000. I am going to assume the absolute worst and assume that they don't compress their expenses whatsoever and so their expenses will tally 317,000,000. Thus their net income will be 166,240,000.

I won't place the income tax because: ""UWMC's net income for periods prior to the first quarter of 2021 does not reflect an income tax provision, since UWM (UWMC's accounting predecessor) is a pass-through entity not subject to federal and most state income taxes. For periods commencing with the first quarter of 2021, UWMC's net income does not reflect the income tax provision that would otherwise be reflected if 100% of the economic interest in UWM was owned by UWMC. Therefore, for comparison purposes, UWMC provides “Adjusted net income”, which is our pre-tax income adjusted for a 23.78% estimated effective tax rate. “Adjusted net income” is a Non-GAAP Metric.""

If one looks at the net income attributable to UWMC on the cash flow statement and then divides by the provision for income taxes, then that is an effective tax rate of 26.8% for roughly 5.7% of the float which is roughly the 6 percent of free float. What I am trying to say is that we only pay net income on the 6% of free float that is the Class A public float. The adjusted net income would be if the entirety of the company was taxed, which it isn't, so disregard adjusted net income as it's not GAAP. We'll assume a 25 percent haircut to income tax as a result (though it would be a higher haircut, I'm just lazy) which would give taxes of 9,664.

After accounting for federal and state taxes, the new net income would be 166,230,336. Net income and thus EPS is pre dividend income, but let's count the dividend before EPS and count it as part of net income for a truly catastrophic scenario. So, let's assume no share buybacks occurred (worst case scenario), we'd then remove 10,310,420.5 (.10\* 103,104,205). The new net income after accounting for dividends is 155,919,916. Please note that in accounting you don't calculate the net income by putting the dividend as a expense. I'm just doing this to give you guys an absolute shit tier scenario with revenue misses, no mortgage servicing rights increases and thus no mortgage servicing income and interest increases, no margin gain, expenses that do not decrease, a bit more tax than they'd actually pay, no shares bought back, and dividends as an expense and thus weigh down on net income and thus EPS. I did not count the interest expense on the new 700 million senior notes however. But it should come to roughly 31 million.

The EPS would be .097, so round it to ten cents. Account for the same EPS for Q3 and Q4. You get 30 cents. This is 30 cents without the dividend payout ratio since the dividend is already accounted for. We'll not include Q1. The dividend of 40 cents alone will net you a p/e ratio of 16.175. The actual EPS for you as a class A shareholder would be 70 cents for the period Q2 to Q4. That would translate to a P/E ratio of 9.24. If you count the EPS of Q1 (which is Earnings per share of .47) then the FY 2021 EPS would be .70 and the P/E ratio would be 8.64. But if you count the dividend of .40 in addition to the EPS then it becomes 1.17 and the P/E ratio becomes 5.52. The only reason I count the dividend is because the dividend payout ratio is literally .006 (.10\*.06=.006) per quarter. However, you're still getting ten cents a quarter on a stock that is 6.47 while retaining your economic interest in the company itself which is adding roughly 77 cents in EPS FY 2021 under a catastrophic failure of epic proportions scenario.

The IV expansion of all existing strikes will cause MMs to overhedge, **making the options market weigh more on the underlying market**, and as strikes become in the money the price action becomes a self-perpetuating feedback loop. In fact, Market Makers tend to LEAVE after meme-ification of a stock, **decreasing the float even more, destabilizing price resistance** while demand skyrockets.

The ultimate reason why this is a great fundamental play? **It's not even a shitty MEME company**. It has great fundamentals and is one of the greatest beneficiaries of our inflationary environment-- **the steel shortage is a powerful macro trend** that's increasing the cash flows and fundamental value of the company, and the leadership is one that will use this macro trend to reinvest, balance their balance sheets, and prime themselves to increase their dominance in the iron/steel industries.

210,TWNK,nvhe4k,2021-06-09 01:13:28,Hostess? Is it time to go balls deep in $TWNK for Pride month 🏳️‍🌈 ?,"Last week I saw Hostess ($TWNK) mentioned by someone in the daily thread. The ticker caught my eye and inspired me to do some DD into the company. Here is what I found:

* Hostess was taken public after filing and emerging for bankruptcy in 2012. Since then it has has strong revenue growth over the past 20 quarters
* The company is now highly profitable and it has weathered the pandemic well.  Gross profit in the past 12 months has been $371 Million, up 39% compared to two years ago.
* Hostess is funneling much of its profits into its business for future growth. It is also rapidly growing its [market share in the Sweet Baked Goods category](https://www.hostessbrands.com/static-files/e20aeeb6-2880-4278-a362-f222573d81f6)
* The company is in the process of reinventing itself and the products it offers. They have announced plans and capital expenditures to break into the morning convenience food market.
* They have also recently expanded their leadership team and appointed [this absolute stud](https://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2021/05/28/hostess-chief-growth-officer-dan-oleary.html) as their new Chief Growth Officer.
* Altogether this puts TWNK is in the much-coveted position of being both a value (think Warren buffett) and growth (thing Bill hwang) type stock. At the moment, there is no dividend as the company is reinvesting cash into its business for future growth, but there are plans for future stock buybacks in 2022 and beyond.
* ANALysts love the stock. The consensus from analysts is Very Bullish (out of the 11 analysts that have covered the stock, 2 TWNK is a strong buy, 6 say its a buy, and 3 say its a hold.

*Now let’s talk shorts*

* Short interest is 20.77% of the float  That’s higher than most meme tickers here (comparable to AMC GME, much higher than BB, WEN, etc). Furthermore, short interest has [increased 44%](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/TWNK/short-interest/) since the start of January are we’re starting to see a number of pops this spring from [failed to deliver shares](https://sec.report/fails.php?tc=TWNK).
* The stock has very low volume right now (only an average of 1.2M shares traded per day). If a squeeze were to happen, at the current volume it would take shorts a month to cover.
* Additionally, 123.67% of all the float is held by institutions, and very little by retail meaning that any significant volume will send the stock flying.
* If TWNK turns into a crusade against shorty, I could see us squeezing to $69. *Right the stock is only at a 2B market cap so there’s plenty of room to grow*

That’s about it thank you for reading to the end. Despite the meme potential and parallels to GME, this stock has surprisingly flown under this sub’s radar so far . There were a few posts back in January (see [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lahib2/twinkies_for_tendies_long_thesis_on_hostess/)  for more extensive DD) that didn’t catch on, but with it being meme season and Pride month 🏳️‍🌈🌈🏳️‍🌈, I could see $TWNK possibly flying past the moon and straight into Uranus 🍑🪐

Position: Currently schLONG 69 shares and got a couple of Jun 18 $17.50 FDs

Good news for some of you on the PLTR earnings report. I suppose you'll be interested in knowing what happened to the stock.

https://preview.redd.it/qwsurb22tky61.jpg?width=1057&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=093e0d476e651e4bcece86ae9f8b96238e4a374a

Here we see some squiggles. It shows that the stock's underlying price movement is becoming less influenced by Gamma and more by \*insert hand waves\* other factors. What other factors? Wouldn't you like to know. But typically gamma is healthy so I wonder if the other factors are less so.

So then we look at the short interest volume. With such a large price jump - did people increase short selling or decrease? Were these shorts a part of options dealings? Were they MM shorting in the dark market? Who knows.

https://preview.redd.it/u9vivncftky61.jpg?width=1069&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da7488cc42dde49754c6ba599ac23cb6c33dcf11

Slight increase but I wouldn't say uber substantial. But it definitely isn't a decrease.

Looking at the options:

https://preview.redd.it/pk3sz1mqtky61.jpg?width=1049&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b44948c90a0f58bd3122e7f15d1f45cfef5fe27c

With a larger-than-expected increase in price, lots of options switched hands, mainly at the $20 at which \~150,000 calls became ITM and \~200,000 puts became OTM. Oof to those bag holders.

But the real interest is in how the options landscape changed. Yesterday's options:/

https://preview.redd.it/hbdu3y31uky61.jpg?width=1047&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ccca5e3d569161e72bccbc00112a259a570487d2

Accounting for the switching of ITM/OTM you'll see a decent increase in calls (\~160k) and puts (\~118k). Since overall delta exposure doubled towards zero it can be said that the majority of those were dealer long and customer short. This is healthy behavior. Considering volatility dropped as well, this suggests continued upside. 

It seems as though the healthy earnings report re-vitalized the stock. There is still rocky ground, however, there may be resistance at $20 but with increased liquidity and stabilizing gamma, there is an argument to be made that it should go beyond. 

The caveat is that if there is downside if it starts causing liquidity issues again the stock may continue its previous trajectory until the options landscape changes more drastically. With okayish accuracy, you can see with increase in volatility, 1.6mil options will have to be hedged via purchasing underlying with 1.8mil via selling. So back to the 1.6:1.8 as before. (For those wondering, did the decrease in volatility today help the stock rise with 1.6million options needing hedging via purchasing with decrease in vol? or was it the prospect of tendies. Lemme know).

Disclaimer: this is not financial advice.

I’m big on studying trends and I believe I have found a 2-3 bagger for you retards. I’ve been following $RIDE for about 2 months now, and I noticed the potential for a short squeeze beginning to form last week. I’ve noticed the propensity to squeeze comes from the following criteria:

* Short % of float must be over 20% ([over 28% of $RIDE’s float is short](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ride); probably closer to 30-32% since it was last updated)
* Small/Mid Cap stocks with considerable growth prospects ($RIDE has a $1.6B market cap) in a hyper-growth EV industry
* Heavily controversial stock, meaning some say it is way overvalued, some say it is undervalued

These stocks tend to be the most volatile. The charts are often comical to even look at (feel free to check out $RIDE’s 6-month chart for reference).

**$MVIS comparison:**

Taking a look at $MVIS, I noticed that Hindenburg research targeted them in a short & distort attack a few months ago.

I actually googled “Hindenburg MVIS” and the second article that popped up was titled “Technically Incompetent Short Seller Hindenburg Makes False Statements About MicroVision.” This bodes very poorly for Hindenburg, as they seem to have started to formulate a lot of their claims out of thin air.

More recently, Hindenburg targeted $RIDE with the same tactics. They called out $RIDE’s pre-orders for their trucks, while almost all EV companies are utilizing pre-orders, this[ has been clear ever since $RIDE went public](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/16/2127140/0/en/Lordstown-Motors-Releases-Business-Updates-Remains-on-Track-to-Begin-Production-of-the-Lordstown-Endurance-in-September-2021.html) last year.

I found a good[ rebuttal post for Hindenburg’s attack on $RIDE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkt7qi/the_bullcase_for_lordstown_motors_corporation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on this sub from not too long ago as well.

**$RIDE Intro:**

Lordstown Motors ($RIDE) is currently developing their [full-size all electric Endurance truck](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/endurance). They have an[ experienced management team](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/corporate-governance/management) with multiple execs from companies like Tesla, Volkswagen, GM, Honda, etc; also, GM’s investment in exchange for their [massive 6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/) helped them hit the ground running. They are targeting commercial fleets and government contracts with their truck initially. Their trucks will be $45,000 after tax credits and get a 75mpg equivalent. They also will require very little maintenance as they utilize true 4 wheel drive with hub motors in each wheel.

Discussing their[ full-year 2020 results](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020) on March 17th, $RIDE management confirmed that “Timeline to Start of Production (SoP) in September 2021 remains on track, with beta prototype build underway and the first beta vehicles to be ready by the end of March; vehicles to be sent for durability, crash, validation, and lighting testing with various partners and to early initial customers for feedback.”

They have[ shown their betas to the public](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1377350607518920705?s=20) as well.

[U.S. Rep.

He called it “‘bull\*\*\*\*. I mean it was just to me, it seemed like a hatchet job for (short-sellers) to make money,” he said. “And look, I mean (Lordstown) is threatening the status quo.

He said he’s seen the company’s robotic assembly line putting together a series of 57 betas. Based on what he’s seen, Rulli said he thinks Lordstown Motors will be producing thousands of Endurance trucks sometime this year or perhaps early next year. “They’re way way way far along,” he said. “Whoever wrote that article (Hindenburg) has never been in that (Lordstown) plant.

They also [recently announced “Lordstown Week”](https://businessjournaldaily.com/lordstown-motors-stock-climbs-14-on-lordstown-week-announcement/) in mid June for analysts, customers, partners, and investors to attend. This will silence all of the short-sellers, lawsuits, and FUD.

$RIDE has an earnings call tomorrow 5/24 where they will be giving updates on crash testing. If they announce they are still on track for mass production in September, this will be HUGE.

**$RIDE Upcoming Catalysts include:**

* [Earnings call tomorrow 5/24](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-announces-timing-first-quarter-2021-financial) to discuss updates on crash testing and timeline to production.

* [Release of ERV in conjunction with Camping World](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2021/01/lordstown-motors-to-reveal-electric-commercial-van-this-summer/), which is expected next month, and the[ Camping World CEO has already leaked a sneak peak](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1379433681995984905?s=20) of it.
* Beta production updates and contracts with commercial fleets.

**Summary:**

$MVIS moved from $10 to $27 in just a couple of days, and I believe $RIDE is about to make a similar move from $10 back to $20+ with their earnings call being tomorrow after-hours.

EVs are front and center, and the government is pushing for the adoption of EVs in such a big way that you’d be a fool not to own a piece of the pie.

$RIDE has one of the lowest market caps out of all of the EV plays, and they are the closest to fully automated mass production (this September).

Position: 5 Jan 2023 calls w/ a $40 strike. I’m planning to buy more tomorrow before earnings.

**TL;DR:**

$RIDE stock has incredibly high upside, and I think it’s only a matter of time until it squeezes back up to the $20’s. I have been following the chart for a while now, and I believe institutions are currently loading up before this gets squeezed back up.

222,UWMC,nvjgk5,2021-06-09 03:01:01,UWMC - What inflation and interest rate mean for profits in mortgage business," Going through Reddit posts, I observe confident apes, and even more, apes looking forward for increases in interest rates. Hold on, **is that really a good thing?**

Note that this is no financial advice. It only expresses basic economics.

***Monetary policy - Inflation and reference rate***

For those without economic background, let me remind that high periods of inflation (above the 2% target) will trigger an increase in the reference rate in order to reduce money supply and bring back inflation to its accepted level (between 0%-2%). Without going into the details, increase in reference rate will transfer to commercial banks and, eventually, increase (variable) mortgage rates.

***Current situation in the US***

Looking at the time series of M2 supply, you can observe that M2 in the US is going through the roof, which has already generated a surge in inflation (4.2% in April 2021 against 0.3% in April 2020). If inflation remains at such high level, the FED will have no choice but to increase the reference rate, which will increase mortgage rates. This will affect clients with variable mortgage rate and roll-over fixed rate contracts.

Michael Burry (known for The Big Short) is betting on this and has puts on T-bills. Why? because an increase in interest rate will decrease bond prices (recall the price of a bond is the Net PV of cash flows, blablabla).

***Client's probability of default at loan origination***

Banks (or loan providers) estimate the probability of defaults (PD), where variables are for example income/affordability because they are good measures to know if the client can repay the loan. Usually, credit officers will calculate the PD with a buffer on interest rate (high interest rate means higher monthly payments which decreases the client's creditworthiness) to give some room in case of increases in interest rate. High income/affordability means good creditworthiness ofc

***Interest rate hikes, PD and demand for properties***

But what happens if inflation increases so much that reference rate is pushed very high? The risk is that the above mentioned buffer (if even existing at loan approval) will not be sufficient to absorb the hikes and clients with variable mortgage rates and roll-over loans will not be able to pay back. Contracts become junk contracts because the underlying client is defaulting.

If the general PD increases due to a major sytemic shock (e.g. significan increase in interest rate), there are two effects: a portion of clients will default and properties will be liquidated on the market, which increases the supply. Second, higher interest rate means higher rents. Hence, fewer clients will be able to afford the loans and therefore the demand for properties will decrease. More supply coupled with less demand necessarily leads to a decrease in house price index.

***Summary:***

Low increase in mortgage rates can be beneficial, yes. But if inflation keeps increasing at this speed and level, we can expect significant increases in reference rate. If increases are significant, some clients will defaults, others will not be able to access new loans, which will increase supply and decrease demand for properties, respectively. I am sure you get it, this situation is terrible for companies operating in mortgage business.",Technical Analysis,0.82

Broke a massive falling wedge on the daily chart with a great increase in volume. It's also a cup and handle dating back to January. There was even confluence with key resistance near the breakout point @ **11.58.**

**13.24** is key support now, keep an eye on that.

We have been coiling under key resistance for a few days (**14.53) THE SECOND THIS BREAKS, WE ARE CLEAR FOR TAKEOFF (AGAIN).** Also - note the way we are coiling upwards below key resistance is a very bullish data point. Volume is declining as we chop up.

Price targets are **17.25 & 20.36.**

This is the best setup I've seen in this stock since the initial squeeze. Remember, keep it simple.

***TL;DR -*** AMC actually looks good for once from an **unbiased** technical standpoint

The only way to stop these types of organized and unwarranted short attacks is to punish the perpetrators financially, again and again. Then, and only then, will you have a free and fair market for all.

$GME is the perfect example of how individual investors discussing the value of a company and deciding they like the stock enough to buy shares and options, can have a profound and unintended effect. And as a consequence of that effect, some folks who often make a living pedaling lies and half-truths, lost a lot of money. As I see it, there is no better lesson than a bought lesson.

&amp;#x200B;

Does this sound appealing to you? No. Well, that may be because you're not one of the brainless zombies scrolling through social media 16 hours a day. WISH targets ads towards this audience in hopes they will download the Wish app, once inside the app, they get access to your Facebook account to get key statistics about you. They then cater your product stream to you. It's a game at that point, for you to find the one thing that ISN'T trash on Wish's app, and get a huge discount.

For **107 million monthly users** this is a very fun and addicting game.

This ticker is currently **down 67%** of its IPO price in just about 6 months. Why?


It's all short-term negatives.

**1.) Negative user growth last quarter.** This is now starting to rebound with the country opening back up, because $WISH's biggest demographic is lower income individuals. Jobs are opening up again, expect a big rebound.

**2.) New business venture of providing logistics for its merchants.** Because of the new investment into this area, the margins for their logistical foray are slim. As this venture scales though, so will the margins. This is a big deal. Think how Amazon has their own delivery vehicles. It serves as a double positive. If you see a WISH van driving down the street that's free advertising while simultaneously providing logistical services.

**3.) Recent earnings was not stellar.** Take a look at the first 2 bullets again and you have your reasoning. Short term detriments.

&amp;#x200B;

So you mean to tell me because of very short term, consequential actions - WISH should be **down 67%** from IPO? You mean to tell me that an e-commerce stock should be trading a **1.6X forward sales** (growing at a rate of 20+% YoY), when the **average forward sales for an online retailer is trading at 4.5X???**

&amp;#x200B;

Wish should easily be double what it's currently valued at, based on sales alone.

Keep in mind technicals are not a crystal ball, they are a **road map.** I do not hold a position *(although if I looked at the chart Friday, I would).*

[$SPCE 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/c32m1rk5eq071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d477968e5afc2875bca36a471e1c77bd84adcbd)

Here you can see we **broke out of a large descending wedge on Friday** (with fantastic volume). This is the same pattern damn near every speculative growth stock has been caught in for the past few months. Normally it has a bearish bias - because it is coming from downside. However, in this scenario - **it broke up -** which means **we can see some fantastic follow through to the upside.**

The price targets for this setup would be **22.61, 26.18, 28.05, 29.71.** These are all resistances - and in a normal situation you would either trim as we run into these, or scale in as we clear them.

However - given the news catalyst - it's hard to say how high we will gap up on Monday. Above that last level is **34.84** and **36.63.** It's unlikely we cross these without an insane short squeeze, or another pattern forming (at least on the shorter term charts).

Remember, each time we clear one of these levels on a **daily close -** it will become a support. As a result, you can trail your stop loss below them as we continue.

This is one of many examples of **""technicals precede news""** I have encountered throughout my trading career - and one of the reasons I try to ignore anything except for the charts while I am trading. It's hard to quantify arbitrary events - and especially hard to do so without bias. Thankfully, we will often **break out of a major pattern prior to a news release -** like you see here.

I'll be looking to day trade this stock next week depending where we open.

250,DASH,nv9vyj,2021-06-08 19:44:58,Russell 3000 Reconstitution Adds $CLOV $DNMR $DASH $PLNT $RIOT,"FTSE Russell released a preliminary list of 255 stocks on Friday to be added to the Russell 3000 index. Some of those stocks like $CLOV, and $DNMR had big moves up on Monday, with continued gains Tues. Others like $PLTR have much smaller gains. $DASH and $RIOT actually closed down. 

**Stocks Being Added to the Russell 3000 include:**

[To see the full list of stocks being added to the Russell 3000, search for “FTSE Russell 3000 index additions” \(the bot keeps flagging the link as a spam link\). ](https://preview.redd.it/m4y9h0piw2471.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e874ddc0551a492c2d10ff7985e842e5e2f161a)

**What is Reconstitution?**  
According to FTSE/ Russell, *“the Russell US Indexes are designed to reflect the ever-changing US equity market, and the annual reconstitution process is critical to maintaining accurate representation. During this highly-anticipated market event, the breakpoints between large, mid and small cap are redefined to ensure market changes that have occurred in the preceding year are captured. Companies are also revaluated to determine where they lie along the investment styles spectrum.”*  

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/dfy6096gw2471.jpg?width=949&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f33bcc22926de307c2665af6f2c0ecf306714009)

**What Does It Mean?**  
It means Index Funds and Mutual Funds that hold the Russell 3000 have to buy the stock by June 25, when the reconstitution takes place. For equities like CLOV, DNMR and others with a large percentage of the float shorted, those short sellers will have added pressure to adjust or exit their positions before the reconstitution drives the price up further. That doesn’t mean every stock being added will have a short squeeze, but it could certainly influence the stock prices. With more buyers, namely index fund managers, that could lead to upward pressure on the price.   


**What Funds Hold Russell 3000?**  
A lot of index funds hold shares in the Russell 3000. Many 401K accounts allow investors to pick target year retirement dates, with a blend of different funds based on an investor’s selected dates. Many of these funds invest in different index funds. If you look at Institutional Investors making purchases of DNMR and CLOV, you’ll see Index Funds are already purchasing shares, including:

 \- VRTTX Vanguard Russell 3000 Index Fund  
 \- IWV iShares Russell 3000 ETF  
 \- TMW SPDR Russell 3000 ETF  
 \- VISGX- Vanguard Small-Cap Growth Index Fund  
 \- VISVX- Vanguard Small-Cap Value Index Fund  
 \- VITNX- Vanguard Institutional Toal Stock Market Index Fund  
 \- VEXMX- Vanguard Extended Market Index Fund  
 \- VBINX- Vanguard Balanced Index Fund Investor Shares

There will undoubtedly be more announced as 13F filings are submitted.  


**The Bottom Line**  
When a stock is added to an index, it typically adds fuel to the stock price short term. With more buyers, and presumably the same number of sellers (or fewer sellers), it puts upward pressure on the price. It’s not automatic, and it’s not all at once—as you can see with DASH and RIOT. When a stock already has momentum, like CLOV and DNMR, this adds fuel to the fire in the short term. If short sellers decided to close out their positions, that adds more upward pressure. It will be very interesting to watch the stocks on the list to see what happens by June 25th.",DD,0.81

This my quick and top of the head version of DCF model for BNGO. Please note that I haven't made any pin-point assumptions. All assumptions are ballmark to just get an high level price estimate. I'm not a financial advisor nor a financial analyst. I'm just a random guy applying his financial education in real life.

I'm more than happy to hear your feedback and update my analysis with more accurate numbers or correct any wrong assumptions. Please let me know if I'm missing any other types of revenues/expenses. If you feel its justified, feel free to share it on other social media platforms! :)

Recently on SeekingAlpha, an analyst did his DCF model and his price came out to be $7.3 which I feel wasn't justified enough. I believe it was because he didn't factor in Saphyr 2.0 potential and didn't project his sales for longer years. Well, so I took it upon myself as a small little challenge to do a DCF myself.

NOTE: This does not include the Nanonozzle revenue projection because at this point in time, its really hard to estimate those numbers. Also just wanted to note that the top analysts on Tip Rank gave BNGO an average price target of $12. I think this sort of proves my analysis that BNGO is at least worth $12.

EDIT: I have received some critical feedback on my analysis from my post on BNGO subreddit. I will be incorporating those changes, but it will only affect my analysis positively.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*\*TLDR; #BNGO2THEMOON\*\*\*\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Units Installed:

Expected sales of Saphyr to increase about 80% every year as more and more labs/clinics/hospitals/etc start to adopt it. Though from year 2028+ I have reduced the adoption to 50% every year, giving me an almost 70% CAGR.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rent/Sold:

I have broken the sales of Saphyr into “rent” and “sold”. This is because there are different consumables agreement with each type of “sale”. As per CFO in Q1 earnings transcript, he said rentals are more sales; however, this might change as Saphyr is still finding its level. My assumption is 60% rent and slowly reducing down to 35% by 2030+.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Revenue per Consumable:

We currently know it costs $550/consumable. As BNGO’s goal is to reduce it to $100, I have done about $50 decrement each year starting 2024 (when Saphyr 2.0 will launch) and achieving $100 from 2028+.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Saphyr 1.0/2.0:

Saphyr 1.0 is just 5000/14 rounding it down to 350 genomes per year. Why divide by 14? Because that’s what Saphyr 2.0 will be able to do.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Min 120 Genome per 6 month (Rent Agreement):

If someone rents from Saphyr, that’s what the agreement states currently. This means minimum 240genome runs at per Saphyr (rented ones) per consumable price every year. I’m assuming they are running the minimum and not the maximum capacity i.e, about 350/year.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sold Saphyr 240 Genome Bundle:

Currently BNGO has a bundle going out for clients who buy Saphyr. For them, the genome run would cost $450 instead of $550. However, for ease of calculation, I have not included the $100 discount in my calculation. Everything is being multiplied by consumable price for the year. I’m assuming they are running the minimum and not the maximum capacity i.e, about 350/year.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Saphyr 2.0 Consumables:

This was the trickiest part in my calculations and involves a lot of “assuming stuff.” We all know they are aiming to launch 2.0 by 2024. Therefore, adoption of 2.0 will take time and as a result it will take some time for revenue to start increasing from 2.0. We also know it will be able to do 5000 genomes a year, but not every lab/clinic/hospital/etc will be running that much. So for my calculation I have assumed only 5% of 5000 genomes runs will be done on the Saphyrs installed everywhere. This will increase by 2.5% over the years up to 20% by 2030+. In terms of CAGR, it will be increasing by almost 180% every year. Given the power of Saphyr 2.0, I think its reasonable enough estimate. I also think this is somewhat conservative and the number will be even higher. My calculations are based on that only 25% of the full power of Saphyr 2.0 will be used. This section is debatable and I’m happy to talk more about it and update it with useful feedback.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Total Revenue:

Revenue growing at 79% CAGR. Again, this is a very conservative number from my perspective. Also, as per Eric (CEO), he expects the revenue to be somewhere between 2.6B – 3.8B with 10,000 Saphyrs sold. In my calculation, we hit 10k mark in year 2029. We can see total revenue is around 2.3B, lower than Eric’s estimation. Though my consumables estimate is between his expectation. Its just the sale of Saphyr that seems to be off. I’m assuming 65% will be sales and 35% will be rent by 2029. Maybe more of sales and less of rent might be a better estimate??

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gross Margin:

Currently BNGO’s margin is around 33%. To be very conservative, I haven’t increased margin by a lot. I’m estimating margin to steadily grow throughout the years.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additional Costs:

This is any other costs over operating expenses, just being more conservative. I’m increasing it at a rate of 20-30% over the years at a 25% CAGR.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Net Profit/(Loss):

You can see BNGO will start to be profitable by year 2024. It will really start to pick up in net profits in year 2026+.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC):

Formula: Cost of Equity + Cost of Debt

Cost of Equity = Risk Free Rate + Beta\*(Market Rate – Risk Free Rate)

Risk Free Rate = 10Yr Treasury Bond = 1.75%

Market Rate = 8%

Beta = 2

Cost of Debt = 0 (As BNGO rarely have any debt)

WACC = 14%

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Free Cash Flow:

Assumed Net Profits as a source of free cash flow available to the company.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Terminal Value:

Assumed a 3% industry average for BNGO. Although this is very unlikely because BNGO is far away from its maturity stage. But for ease of calculation purpose, BNGO will grow at 3% for the rest of its life.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Firm Value:

After discounting all the CFs for 10 years at 14%, it gives me the company value to be around 5.5B. This is about 3x the current market cap.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Outstanding Shares:

The current outstanding shares are 279M. For the sake of dilution articles out there, lets say BNGO raises extra $350M and lets say at $7 price, this would mean extra 50M shares. So, out outstanding would now be 329M.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Price per Share:

With the 5.5B MV and 279M O/S share, this gives me a share price of $20. This is about 3x the current share price. Giving a potential upside of about 200%. Even with the extra $350M offering, the price would fall to $16.7 per share.

Well, in any case, as per my assumptions in the discounted cashflow method, BNGO seems to be heavily discounted.",DD,0.92

255,A,nq4abi,2021-06-01 22:51:51,"A forecasted potential earnings Breakdown for AMC, BB, &amp; ASO 😎 from one dork to a bunch of retards","First things first, I hope you all understand that math is scientific, and these numbers will be pretty accurate but with all things finance sometimes assumptions must be made. The assumption being made here is that the stock market will react to AMC, BB, and ASO short squeezes EXACTLY as it did to GME. A true apples to apples comparison of what has happened to GME being applied to our other favorites.

Up first is teaching you how to calculate earning in the form of a percentage. The formula goes like this. (Current Value - initial Cost)÷initial cost x 100= percentage return. 

GmE started at roughly 18$ before it gained squeeze worthy traction and eventually topped out at $483. I chose 18$ as the starting point t because earning up until that point were smooth and slowly trending upwards on a 1 year chart. GmE has 70 Million Shares outstanding. It's 18 to 483 dollars increase gives it a return of 2,583% roughly.

Applying this to AMC goes like this. AMC had a ""pre-surge"" stable price of 10$. 10x25.83=258$ however GME only has 15 percent of the shares outstanding that AMC has so you have to consider the market Cap. $258x.15%= $38.70 expected squeeze price. All variables being the same at its highest AMC could go to $38.70 

BB is going  to be very similar to AMC because of a large market cap. BB ""pre-surge"" stable price is $10 as well, this is being generous because a good argument could be made to use $8-9 but I decided to use 10. So 10x25.83=$258 however GME only has 12% of shares outstanding as BB so that has to be factored in 258x .12%= $30.96  I believe at the height of any BB squeeze due to market cap the price could soar as high as $30 using GME variables.

Here is where things get interesting ASO has a ""pre-surge"" stable price of $30 and GME has 77% of shares outstanding compared to ASO, a Much higher variable, with a much higher starting price, and a higher short interest than BB & AMC. Here we go 30x25.83= 775$ 
775 x.77= $596 squeeze price potential

So in essence we can triple our money or better on AMC & BB depending on when you bought in. AsO has the potential to be HUUUGGE🚀🚀💯😃",DD,0.78

269,DD,ntr1wb,2021-06-06 19:38:35,The Weekly DD - Clover Health (CLOV): Moon or Bust? (Full DD),"**Another healthcare company?**

CLOV is a US health insurance company currently specialized in offering Medicare Advantage plans to elderly Americans. As an elderly American seeking healthcare insurance, one of the very first choices presented is whether to go with the federally run Medicare or the privately provided Medicare Advantage (still federally funded though). The difference is as follows:

* Medicare allows the customer to choose what the plan covers. They have Part A (hospital care), Part B (doctor visits and services), and Part D (prescriptions).
* Medicare Advantage is Part C, a pre-packaged plan which bundles together Parts A, B, and (usually) D. Medicare Advantage includes all services that Medicare has plus some.

Medicare Advantage usually makes the process more streamlined and easier. Depending on the plan, it may even be cheaper than Medicare. However, the drawback is a much narrower physician network that’s usually based around a local geography. Thus, if you travel anywhere else, it will be difficult to find in-network physicians for care.

CLOV attempts to innovate in this space with their software platform, Clover Assistant. This is a platform which synthesizes all the data available to healthcare insurance providers to provide better patient outcomes. They do this through several features:

* Evidence-based Protocol: using a data-driven model, the Clover Assistant can provide physicians clinical recommendations based upon the patient’s unique situation (history of disease, allergies, etc.).
* Early Disease Detection: machine learning models can predict potential diseases even when the patient is asymptomatic. It provides a list of what chronic diseases the patient may be at risk for so that the physician can conduct early screening if necessary.
* Quality Gap Closure: surfaces opportunities for additional services that the patient should perform. The physician can take the visit as an opportunity to perform these services or to recommend these specific services to the patient for later.

By doing this, they hope to achieve better early detection and preventative care within their customers which leads to less emergency room visits, less unplanned procedures and prescriptions, and less heart ache (quite literally). All this equates to less *unplanned* *costs* for CLOV and more revenue from their insurance policies. With Medicare advantage plans, the government provides a certain pot of money for covering customer Medicare benefits with certain incentives built in. If all incentives are met and no additional services are needed, then the insurance provider pockets all the remaining money as profit. That’s why CLOV is so focused on decreasing these unplanned costs (and of course, for the people).

**Healthcare - Lacks in appeal**

Medicare is currently only available to those over 65 (though there are proposed regulations to change this which we’ll review later). This is CLOV’s – and other Medicare Advantage providers’ – target demographic. By 2040, adults in the US over the age of 65 is expected to more than **double**, reaching 80 million. Adults age 85+ is expected to **quadruple.** 

https://preview.redd.it/9afneo9olo371.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce2d3c332eee871f02c6e955a409c6011622d981

&#x200B;

Moreover, Americans are living longer which means that Medicare will need to cover more for a longer period. In 2000, the average American male, upon turning 62, could expect to live 19 years longer. In 2040, it is estimated that they will live 22 years longer. This estimate is even higher for females.

This necessitates an expansion of Medicare and Medicare Advantage providers to support America’s aging population. We can see this rapid growth within the national health expenditure (NHE) data that the government releases. In 2019, NHE grew by 4.6% to $3.8T. By 2028, it is expected to grow to **$6.2T.** The largest expenditure for government spending in 2019 was in private health insurance spending which grew 3.7% to **$1.2T** (31% of total NHE). If current spending ratios hold, the 2028 expected spend on private health insurance will be **$1.92T.**

Beyond that, enrollment in Medicare Advantage plans has been growing at faster rate every year since 2005. In 2020, nearly 40% of all Medicare beneficiaries were on a Medicare Advantage plan.

https://preview.redd.it/t4j169dplo371.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=a44f4e56483385721f4b034c285d513246c51d20

&#x200B;

Currently, this industry is dominated by a small number of players with three firms making up over 50% of all Medicare Advantage plan offerings.

* UnitedHealth Group serves \~6.5M people.
* Humana serves \~4M people.
* BCBS serves \~2.5M people.

https://preview.redd.it/b89k1msqlo371.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=09f05df9cad06d0d473366ad04eb8028470c3942

Furthermore, competition is fierce within this space with premiums on plans slowly declining since 2015.

https://preview.redd.it/fvj0s8cslo371.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=b011e630db50b7008e6f2006b9444e369f69362c

&#x200B;

Medicare Advantage plans has become increasingly popular from standard Medicare plans. This trend is observed in every state in the US. The increasing popularity of Medicare Advantage plans is most pronounced in for-profit plans which now account for 71% of all enrollees in 2021. Market emergent players (venture-backed players) accounted for \~240,000 enrollees (\~1% of the national enrollees) which is the largest amount it has ever accounted for.

https://preview.redd.it/zr2ys39tlo371.png?width=868&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2d6d1654276df35b2cc1759ff4b8c812b2797db

In general, healthcare is growing rapidly to keep pace with US’ aging population. Medicare Advantage specifically is growing even faster as it remains highly competitive compared to Medicare. However, as big players wrestle for market share, premiums decline, and profits become more difficult to capture. It is a lucrative market for share but crowded and highly competitive.

**Small fish, big sea**

CLOV is attempting to carve a piece of this market out for themselves. They are a smaller local provider operating in 8 states: Arizona, Georgia, Mississippi, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas. CLOV is one of the nation’s fastest growing insurers capturing \~50% of the net increase in membership across its established markets over the previous three years.

https://preview.redd.it/r6qdc7kulo371.png?width=1190&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e474994dead07b53f86c73ddd628ea4c96e40b0

&#x200B;

They currently serve more than 57,000 members across 34 counties. However, is this growth scalable? Proponents of CLOV believe they can do this. And certainly CLOV is tripling its footprint, expanding out to 74 new counties. Whether this translates to similar levels of growth within these counties is yet to be seen. While capturing 50% of the growth within a county is impressive, they are operating only with a network of less than 60,000 members.

Remember, UnitedHealth Group serves over 6M members. I can’t conclude one way or another if this growth is scalable, but certainly it will become harder and more competitive to scale as they continue growing.

They’re primary moat is in Clover Assistant. However, AI in healthcare is not a new concept. In fact **95%** of health care executes are looking to hire business and analytics staff with experience developing AI. 59% of these executives expect a positive return on the investments they have *already* made in AI. Whereas the scope of their AI may be different than CLOV’s, it is hard to argue that CLOV will be able to maintain a moat when they have access to the same data and technology as their competitors (and even less of it since they have less than 60,000 members).

Furthermore, Hindenberg Research released a damning short report for CLOV. While many of the points raised were addressed by CLOV, some, I still consider legitimate and should worry all potential investors:

* CLOV did not disclose that its AI, Clover Assistant, is under active investigation by the Department of Justice. This investigation regards 12 issues from kickbacks to predatory marketing practices to undisclosed third-party dealings. While I won’t speculate on the severity of these allegations and the results of this investigation, it is alarming that CLOV was not forthright with its investors in revealing this information.
* CLOV has a large dependency on a broker called Seek Insurance which is 50% owned by CLOV. While it is not uncommon for healthcare insurers to use independent brokerages, it is very misleading for Seek Insurance to claim “unbiased and independent” advice with Medicare plans when they are owned by a Medicare Advantage insurer. CLOV responded saying that Seek Insurance is independently operated, but it is difficult to imagine that CLOV has no sway in them even though they own them.
* CLOV’s CEO, Vivek Garipalli, has a history of predatory price-gouging and all-around immoral business practices. Prior to founding CLOV, he owned CarePoint Health which operated 3 hospitals in New Jersey where he charged the highest emergency room service prices in the entire country. Furthermore, he was at the center of an alleged scheme to siphon $157M from his own business into his personal bank account through exorbitant management services charged by LLC’s under his name to his own company.

**Financials**

CLOV’s financials paint a picture of a rapidly growing company. Their revenues increased from $277M in 2018 to $680M in 2020. While their operating costs also grew, it grew at a significantly lesser rate leading to lower net losses in general. In 2018, CLOV reported net losses of $186M and in 2020, they had reduced this to $93M. Their net income losses, however follows a different trajectory. Due to losses from continued operations, their net income had losses of $200M in 2018, $364M in 2019, and $136M in 2020. While 2020 does represent their lowest losses ever, it is not entirely clear whether this is part of a trend or if it’s a one-off fluke.

Their balance sheet does not paint a pretty picture. With total assets of $270M and liabilities of $430M, it is clear that they must fund their continued operations through equity. Remember, they are losing over $100M per year as well. Thus, it is entirely possible that they will dilute their existing equity in order to fund continued operations.

**So, do I like CLOV?**

The short answer is no. CLOV is a small, but fast-growing insurer valued at $3.7B. While they definitely have impressive AI technology, it is not unique in the industry and will not be a moat for them. Their CEO has been involved in shady dealings in the past and the fact that they cannot be forthright about active investigations into their business is concerning. They are currently burning through cash without a healthy balance sheet to hold them through which means that it is likely they will issue additional equities to stay afloat. 

The industry that they are in is certainly lucrative and if they can get a foothold, they will justify their current valuation. However, for my personal conviction, the cons outweigh the pros and I will be passing on this stock.

**TLDR;**

1. CLOV first gained popularity as a short-squeeze “play” versus being a fundamentally solid company with potential growth.
2. Clover Health’s moat lies in Clover Assistant, which is a data analytics and AI platform used to better diagnose patients, saving CLOV on unplanned costs and increases revenue from their insurance policies. However, AI in healthcare is not a new concept. In fact 95% of health care executes are looking to hire business and analytics staff with experience developing AI.
3. Hindenburg Research released a short-report on the company that enlightens some facts and opinions for a bearish case. It also discloses that Clover Assistant is currently being investigated for predatory marketing practices.
4. Although the company has been having stellar revenue growth, their costs associated with revenue have also increased exponentially. Financially, they don’t have the best liquidity and are spending a lot of cash, which raises concerns for potential share dilution down the road.
5. Lastly, their total addressable market is still quite small. They are operating within a network of less than 60,000 members. Although there is room to grow this market to members of a lower age, you have to remember they are targeting medicare to elderly Americans.",DD,0.69

278,BB,nuou81,2021-06-07 23:59:53,Where can BB make it too besides the moon?,"I've been reading the BB tape for months. There is usually a very aggressive daily short position that takes about 20,000-40,000 shares after the open and keeps the price down. It generally stair steps the price down all day. It disappeared on the tape the moment it broke over 10 bucks. My guess is the big guys are ready to let the price start to sore. I doubt the real shorts went anywhere except for shorting at the top of key resistance levels.

If BB Ape buyers keep up the buying then BB could be sitting between extremely high historic levels at 42.49, 68.33, 85.32, AND 124.24 in a manner of weeks/months. Unlike AMC or GME, BB has historic levels to work off. That gives days traders and institutions a guide to trade and they will absolutely make those willing to take the risk a killing as this keeps going to their upper ranges. It will eventually be trading like the Internet of Things/Cyber Security that it is becoming before it monetizes and current buyers will just get in the ground floor and make some decent cash for their investment. When BB comes out showing that it has began to monetize the real accumulation phase will be over because the price will already be trading at the new ranges. Think TSLA, CCIV, etc. They all traded over their values highly and then fell back to earth before going back up. They whipsaw so that the big players can make money off selling high and buying low. Translate screw retail traders that buy high and then think its all over and sell low only to watch it rip again. 

My guess is that the sweet high spot of 85.32 is where BB will head to before a fall  for back to that 68.33 level. It will then  trade in range up towards 85.32 for a while. It will trade in a range for several months or up to a year or so before a rip beyond 85 to around the all time highs mentioned above as this becomes the new accumulation phase. The Prem Watsa's (Warren Buffett of Canada) will get BB to somewhere between the 70 and 80s before stepping off the gas and letting the shares fall back to no lower than the 20s-30s so they can acquire them again at a discount. Their motto is buy wholesale and sale retail. That is exactly what they did after the January surge. They bought every share they could at a discount and of course they sold some in the 10-20 range and will just buy more.

5. Workhorse has developed its integrated drone named Horsefly which works with their trucks (see pictures). The trucks have a control center and charging capabilities. No one can deny that this is the future of commerce and there's no going back. Zero-emissions electric delivery step trucks traveling to a center point and launching their drones to deliver products to customers. Delivery should occur within 30 minutes after being ordered and Workhorse is set up to do this. Is there any retail company that will not benefit from this delivery structure? Think about it, Walmart, Fed Ex, Amazon, UPS, Postal Services, Supermarkets for food delivery, etc?
6. 350,000 delivery trucks are already sold per year according to the New York Times. This number is projected to increase.
7. Cathie Wood of Ark Investment Management, who has been very popular lately (google her), had purchased a few million shares for her fund. She has since sold. This may be due to not wanting to hold on to something that is being heavily shorted (more on that below). Her funds have gotten beaten up a bit after hitting their 52-week highs a few weeks ago. Her funds may also be on the receiving end of a process called Organizational Shorting. It's a complex process where market makers unpack and manipulate the positions within her funds and essentially short them. I'm not sure if this adversely affected her funds as I couldn't find any literature on a correlation but something to consider nonetheless.
8. In April, Workhorse more than doubled its production of trucks in comparison to the combined previous three quarters. The Pride Group placed an order for 6230 trucks. That's 6230 trucks equating to several hundreds of millions of dollars!!! That's an enormous number of trucks and that's only from one wholesaler.
9. Workhorse's main problems are with manufacturing and delivery. The reasons why:
10. They're limited in part due to supply chain constraints. There are bottlenecks within the global supply chain and offshore shipping delays of commodity raw materials and components. This has impacted the entire industry, including Ford and GM. This is only TEMPORARY and will get worked out as it always does because every company wants to increase their sales. In addition, Workhorse now has a supply agreement with Coulomb Solutions, Inc. to supply their batteries. This company distributes for the largest EV battery manufacturer in the world.
11. Electric trucks are a relatively new industry. Demand has skyrocketed so Workhorse's capacity to meet this demand has been limited. Recognizing that this will be something difficult for them to achieve, they teamed up with someone who can. They're now partnered with J.B. Poindexter & Co., a leading provider of commercial vehicle bodies. Poindexter has decades of experience with vehicle body engineering, construction, and assembly.
12. There are several EV players. Most only have concepts and prototypes and we know from history that most will likely fail. Workhorse already has actual vehicles and these vehicles have driven millions of miles.
13. Sales for the first quarter of 2021 were approximately $521,000 compared to approximately $84,000 in the first quarter of 2020. That is a significant increase and they are growing rapidly.
14. Recent losses were mainly due to a decrease in the stock price of RIDE, which Workhorse was invested in.
15. The Company had approximately $205.1 million in cash in March 2021. This helps limit the need to acquire debt.
16. The stock has recently been beaten down due to having lost out on a $6 billion contract with the USPS last February. It's now June and the stock price reflects this as the market has already factored this in. This makes for a prime opportunity to invest in this company. This one-time contract will not be the only contract that the USPS offers nor does it mean Workhorse will lose out on other contracts from the USPS or other companies. Furthermore, Workhorse may still win this $6 billion contract as they are fighting it on the legal front. In addition, the USPS Postmaster, Louis DeJoy, who influences the direction of the contract, is being investigated by the FBI for possible fraudulent activity. There is concern that he may have made the decision based on political contributions. Several Ohio Congress members are also requesting a halt on the contract until it's assured that no political influence was asserted in Mr. DeJoy's decision of granting it to Workhorse's competitor. If this contract once again becomes up for grabs, there's a good chance Workhorse will win it. If that happens, watch out because the loss of this contract is what put downward pressure on its stock. Forget the moon, I'm talking about GN-z11, the furthest galaxy from us.
17. Implied volatility has significantly increased resulting in the expensive option pricing you're seeing. This may indicate investors are expecting a big move and this risk is getting priced in.
18. There are 8\* analysts who have recently ranked WKHS. Five recommend a hold and three recommend a buy. NONE recommend a sell. It's unanimous, NONE recommend selling. Some of the analysts' recommend price targets are even $24, $20, $20, and $17. \*Cowen & Co, Colliers Securities, Oppenheimer, Roth Capital, R.F. Lafferty, BTIG, B. Riley Financial, and Wolfe Research.
19. You're helping the environment by investing in this company and you are becoming a part of the future.
20. The stock price is about 30% of its 52-week high.
21. This stock has an AMAZING SHORT SQUEEZE POTENTIAL. It's shorted about 40% of its float. It is one of the most, if not THE MOST, shorted stock out there.

It's very important to understand how a short squeeze works and you can't expect it to happen overnight. It takes discipline as no hedge fund manager is going to capitulate and hand money to you, especially now. The short sellers have borrowed shares to sell which drives the stock price down and they know you get fearful when this happens. They're accustomed to feeling fear because they deal with it every day. They've learned to process this emotion and not act upon it. However, they count on you not having the experience to deal with fear. They're counting on you selling out of fear (the bottom) and buying out of greed (the top). If you wait them out, they will eventually give in because every day you hold they lose money on the interest that they pay when borrowing their short shares. Also, the people lending them shares will not want to assume the risk indefinitely. The bottom line is that you have to hold and buy and not sell. Buying out of the money calls also helps because the market makers who sold you the naked calls need to cover by buying shares to protect themselves as the stock price rises.

So, how to deal with fear?

1. Accept and expect fear to happen because it will. Anticipate it and do not act upon it.
2. Do not invest money that you can't afford to lose. This way you can let it ride.
3. Remember the ups and downs with GME and AMC. AMC was shorted about 20% on its float, it took a while and a lot of ups and downs but look what it eventually did. WKHS is shorted about double the amount of AMC!!!

Also, understand that hedge fund managers DO KNOW MORE about finance than you or I do but they are NO BETTER AT INVESTING than we are. They don't make their money from making good stock picks. They make their money from taking a cut of the money they're investing for other people. They make up fancy words, algorithms, and models to convince their customers to invest with them but overall they can't even beat the Dow. Numerous studies have shown this to be the case and a monkey throwing darts randomly at stock picks is able to beat them. The few that do outperform the market can be explained by the normal outliers of a bell curve distribution. The same distribution happens with us in WSB as it is the natural order of things. Look it up if you don't believe it.

TLDR

1. WKHS is prime for a short squeeze. It is one of the most, if not the most, shorted stock out there.
2. WKHS fundamentals do not look as bad as it is priced. Out of 8 research analysts who follow it, all recommend either a buy or hold and NONE recommend a sell. Price targets for several were at or above $20.
3. Most of the negative aspects of the company have been addressed.
4. Demand for their products has skyrocketed.
5. Don't be lazy, don't TLDR this one, ready the whole thing.

281,WISH,nqkzbc,2021-06-02 14:46:43,WISH Institutional Share Increase with Open Puts.,"I heard you like DD and bear hunting so here's the big reveal. &amp;gt;!Sometimes the bear is the bull.!&amp;lt;

**Source:** reading through 13F Filings of hedgies

**On this episode of Who Owns These Puts?**

Our robot Edgar or Marvin, whatever you want to call him... dropped us GOLD! Through some digging on all 13F filings recently, there is only 1 big owner for the over 9000 $WISH puts that expire very soon. From there we find the inner workings of a rocket in assembly that we must sit in on before they launch. Talk about free lunch.

**Current short float:** \&amp;gt;10%

**Who do you think it is?** Melvin? Citadel? Guess again, it's &amp;gt;!Sus-quana (SIG)!&amp;lt;

**Who else would hold this ""sus"" position?**

**Exhibit A:** Who owns $16m in puts?

https://preview.redd.it/iyv4zpcilu271.png?width=1304&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ce70b5867f585a9cff56d515ea87fcd78c90e769

&amp;amp;#x200B;

**Exhibit B:** 5/17 filing over 9000 OI, the only possible culprit for 6/18 expirations

https://preview.redd.it/ozzqetdjlu271.png?width=2175&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ee3375750adab580e2cc4d97c4b14e7cdc06584f

&amp;amp;#x200B;

**Exhibit C:** 3/26/2021 Sus owns 420,000 shares and around 2000 puts to hedge possibly (Not sure who bought those shares but he/she probably likes 420.)

3/26 13F Filing (At the time \~$16/share)

&amp;amp;#x200B;

**Exhibit D:** 5/17 Sus now owns 1,188,000 shares, up 2.2x or 768,000 shares in 3 months.

5/17 13F Filing (At the time \~$9/share)

&amp;amp;#x200B;

**Questions?**

But wait didn't they buy from $16 to $9, and $15 put with 9000 contracts open? So are they long or are they short?

**1.**) Sus is now a bag holder of WISH at \~ $12, trading at $7.74, that would mean a $4m+ loss on paper if they were to close out. (LONG BAG HOLDER)

**2.**) $15put with 9000 contracts. What a coincidence, owning shares at \~$16. Did someone open a position to push the price down?

It's quite possible that they shorted the price down to buy more shares while holding puts. (Long bag holder and accumulating more shares.)

**3.**)Let's see what hedgy friend is doing. \*enters Citadel

**Exhibit E**: 2/16 Citadel owns roughly 69,000 shares (Price at time $25)

https://preview.redd.it/kkqxrz5mlu271.png?width=2140&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f06df0e7273958c79a5bb4eea63e0c7fbd2790a6

&amp;amp;#x200B;

**Exhibit F:** 5/17 Citadel owns roughly 926,000 shares, 13x increase or +857000 shares(Price at time $8.74)

https://preview.redd.it/ofz102kmlu271.png?width=2144&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1d18321317657b88376a7967c4edffffb7dce0e7

&amp;amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**: Maybe hedgies just made a bad investment and they averaged down? (Sure it's possible, but what are they going to do with all the shares?) Wrong! Push down price, buy more shares, rocketship, profit. Hedgies are about to lift off a rocket secretly but we just got **access to the sneak peak before it goes!**

**TLDR**: When bulls wear bear clothing. Ride them. Wish pummeled so shares can be acquired.

**Position:** Original 5000 shares @ $7.8

Update*
Closed. Bought into GME.

I've said it before, and I'm saying it again... 

WELL Health is lining up to be the next CLOV. 

WELL Health Technologies (WELL) (WLYYF) 

*  20%+ Short Interest
* Raised $305M priced 30% above market led by the 29th richest man in the world. 
*  JP Morgan and RBC extended credit lines to over $500M combined
* Aggressive M&A activity that caused no dilution which now puts them as the largest clinic provider in Canada and expands footprint into the US through CRH Medical. 
* Nearly $500M in revenue with $100M in EBITDA 
* Fenwick & West Engaged for a NASDAQ IPO in Q4 of this year - Fenwick did literally every big name from FB and AMZN to COIN and is extremely exclusive. Likely that they selected WELL. 

By no means am I saying CLOV is a bad company I really like them both but WELL just seems like a situation where the market hasn't caught up to the fundamentals and I think it's just a matter of time now. 

I mean look at this... A year of consolidation while the company has exponentially increased the business offering. Time for the chart to do the same 🚀🚀🚀

Actually, AMC was my inspiration for looking deeper into the GME chart - it had/has a **fantastic setup**.

[AMC TA](https://preview.redd.it/gju8synduwz61.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=46c863adbb144c04e3327bb212a79bb1633608fc)

Broke a massive falling wedge on the daily chart with a great increase in volume. It's also a cup and handle dating back to January. There was even confluence with key resistance near the breakout point @ **11.58.**

**13.24** is key support now, keep an eye on that.

We have been coiling under key resistance for a few days (**14.53) THE SECOND THIS BREAKS, WE ARE CLEAR FOR TAKEOFF (AGAIN).** Also - note the way we are coiling upwards below key resistance is a very bullish data point. Volume is declining as we chop up.

Price targets are **17.25 & 20.36.**

This is the best setup I've seen in this stock since the initial squeeze. Remember, keep it simple.

***TL;DR -*** AMC actually looks good for once from an **unbiased** technical standpoint

Not Financial Advice

Edit: Only thing I forgot to mention was the upper trendline of the wedge extends back to that 17.25 high - this is just another data point that adds to the validity of the breakout.

Dark Pools: 
(Research from Remarkable-Winter348)

Institutions are trading shares back and forth to each other today in order to keep prices pinned today. Dark pool trades reported for SNDL have accounted for 63% of the total volume today. DARK POOLS are exchanges that only whales and funds can use. Over the past 20 days, the average dark pool volume has been 77%. Total volume in the dark pool is 102.1 million. The VWAP price for only the dark pool trades is 1.19.

Whales have suddenly started loading up on shares of SNDL. They know something big is coming and they don't want to over pay for stock. Just be PAYtient and know they will let it run up a bit by end of day. Too much volume here and unfortunately this is the way the game is played. The good news is.. You're in good company!",DD,0.84

People who have been here for awhile probably will find little value in this post but who knows maybe you will. Hell, newer people probably wont either but it could be useful to think about some of what I have to say who knows I did too much brick red shit is getting weird.

***Keep in mind obviously I am retarded and my opinion is terrible, do not read further. I sniff glue, and none of this is financial advice all it is meant to do is engage your brain to think about things before picking sides or spreading information that could cause harm. Also, Excuse my grammar its worse than my investment strategy.***

I am generally curious to hear thoughts about the current situation in both what happened to AMC today or anything related to it, and I guess just general thoughts surrounding both BB and AMC without shitting on the other with misinformation and FUD. It is starting to look like a BB vs AMC brawl at the moment with AMC getting shit on for a terrible misguided reason. I don't know how many people are actually contributing to said shit but ***ignorance breeds FUD.***

I am not going to attack people investing in BB or anyone talking bad about AMC or vice versa because everyone is entitled to their own opinion and can say and invest in whatever they want to, I just hope you can think about both sides and research into it yourself before doing so at the least. Honestly, I believe that both companies have potential, I lean more toward AMC because I know more about it  (which is not much because again I am retarded) not because BB is terrible or a dumb investment I just do not know much about it so I will not have a strong opinion on it. I will however be looking into it tonight because more knowledge is always a positive. The more we educate ourselves, the better decisions we can make. That being said I think AMC is being shit on a little harder because of the FUD that happened today with AMC price and the media's pushing of BB and spreading AMC FUD as well. Paperhands more than likely contributed heavily today with short attacks to suppress AMC gainz but this is just speculation.

AMC's sold shares to Murdock 2 days ago and also some to the market today and it is being blown way out of proportion in a negative fashion which in all honesty it could very well be very advantageous to retail's gainz. On the surface that statement sounds insane to most people who do not know much about the stock market or business operations in general. If you look up information directly from AMC and try to understand what was actually done and why it was done and logically think about it instead of trusting others 100%, Today could have played out very differently. I'm not saying it was a terrible day by any means just stating that it possibly could have been better if FUD could have been spotted and stamped out by retail more efficiently by thinking for themselves and not relying on others most of the time. 

**Retail needs to be VERY cautious when reading about ANY news they hear about the market, retail has completely flipped the market upside down and media will be a huge factor in trying to get retail ""back in line"" we have seen it happening for months. There is and will also be more retail to flock to these stocks that will drive volatility higher which means retail must not accidently spread FUD and learn to think for themselves based on data and facts given. If we do not think for ourselves a little more, and be more skeptical about what we hear, less tendies will be had.** 

The 20m shares that got issued were going to go into the Outstanding shares regardless if they sold them to the market. The shares were going to be given to the executives of AMC for their personal benefit, instead they used these shares to secure capital to be used in the future benefit of AMC and thus retail, the shareholders. They gave up personal gain to have more capital infused into AMC, this to me is very good news. The only way shorts do not have to cover is AMC going bankrupt which capital they gained from those shares helps to avoid. **These shares were basically going to be a bonus that AMC executives refused in order to give it to the company.** Think about all that has happened to AMC, then think about what you hear happen at failing companies and what their executives do before said company goes tits up. Ill give you a hint they usually dont try to decline bonuses to help the company. Granted you could argue they are nowhere near close to claiming bankruptcy, but even so more than anything I think it proves that they actually give a shit and are grateful to retail for saving their ass, then I must have ate too many crayons.

About the ""dilution"" problem, think about it logically. Do you think that roughly 20m shares that were added on two different days with \~480M and \~590m volume on the days in question, to a share count that is already somewhere around 500M that is roughly 80% owned by retail already is fucking us over? If you think it does, is it really enough to jump ship / spread FUD? It could be, who knows, but my retarded brain thinks otherwise. I am not telling you what to think but rather to actually think about it/ research it and come to your own conclusion. Even if you have no interest in investing in AMC spreading negative things about it only hurts the other so called ""meme"" stocks that directly correlate to it.

AMC no longer has any shares to sell they have 46k shares left, which means retail will have the final say on any vote in shareholder meetings as they own the majority of shares and AMC can not ""dilute"" the outstanding shares if you believe that is actually what they have been doing with ill intent. They want to have the ability to issue 25m shares and given the circumstances that AMC just survived I think it is a good idea to have that option in their back pocket as they literally don't have to use them unless needed. **I am not telling you that you should believe what I believe.** I know a majority of retail might not agree with my opinion and that is completely fine I just want some thought to be put into it, think about it and research it yourself. If you come to the same conclusion then vote against it in the meeting. **Retail will have final say in the deal so we must be educated about any matter like this that may come to a vote**. This deal might be completely irrelevant in fact it probably is but who knows it is better to be prepared so an informed decision can take place. Retail literally has final say in decisions that can effect an entire multi billion dollar company. What Retail decides in any vote will effect the company and in turn each of the individual investments in it. Give it some effort

We all know what happened today with AMC price (6/3/2021). I Don't think it was the best day ever by any means but it was not all that bad. Considering the circumstances with the confusion that happened throughout the day with shares being sold by AMC, especially when you factor in new investors who are not yet accustomed to the FUD seen everyday ***Midday was was one fucking hell of a ride.***  We should think about the positives of today as well as the negatives instead of focusing mainly on the latter. I think today was nowhere near as bad as what some would think.

One final note, The live stream of AMC's CEO Adam Aron answering questions Is one of the main reasons I will continue to support AMC. **In my own personal opinion** I am extremely hyped for what is going to happen tomorrow. I could be completely wrong but it seems like He knows what the hell he is doing and he actually gives a shit. I know there is an argument that could be made that it was all an act because of retails majority share ownership. I just don't get that vibe from him, the man sounded like is taking us seriously or at least that he actually is taking steps to understand retail as best as possible in order to make decisions we would support as a majority. If you have not watched it yet I would recommend doing so if you are interested or are already invested in AMC. **Remember there are legalities that a CEO has to follow which could account for some of the things being said by Adam. I did not look into this but it is something to consider if something seems off, that doesn't mean that everything that seems fishy is because of this.**

I'm not going to end with some speech about holding the line or be proud. Just give thought to everything you see, be skeptical and do some research. The more of this that occurs the better off retail is as a whole, and the better off you as an individual will be in securing your tendies.

Anything said above was for the purpose of discussion and getting people to really give it some thought and effort before believing/spreading everything that seems like it is true or that you want to be true.

TLDR: Ignore entire wall of text and watch Adam Aron answer [Questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-EkPZMIAeM) then maybe read above if not just try being more skeptical of everything and put the research and thought into your actions. Effort will be what makes the difference. Emotions are peaking and it important we stay vigilant.",Discussion,0.85
302,AMC,ntp2xh,2021-06-06 18:07:01,No AMC or BB holders should be wearing pants and here's the analysis to prove it,"Like all of you, I was fascinated by Adam Aron's bold strategy to not wear pants in a [Zoom interview](https://www.crossingbroad.com/2021/06/adam-aron-did-not-appear-to-be-wearing-pants-on-this-zoom-call.html) last week. However, I was even more fascinated by the correlation between Aron's refusal to wear pants and the price of AMC. As you can see in my red crayon analysis below, Thursday saw a deep AMC dive, but quickly rebounded after Aron's daring refusal to wear pants during his interview. As a result of Aron's fearless leadership, tendies soared, and it rained diamonds. Of course, paper handed bitches  immediately started denying that Aron was pantsless, causing fear and doubt among the lesser apes, and AMC dropped on Friday.

But all this no pants business got me thinking. What about ***MY*** pants? If Aron's no pants correlation is true for AMC, is it also true for BB? Luckily, I hadn't yet eaten all of my red crayons, allowing me to do another deep dive into BB, which is also posted below. As any true smooth brainer can see, there is an obvious correlation between whether I had pants on and the price of BB. I was WFH on Tuesday and Wednesday, so obviously I refused to wear pants, and BB soared as a result. However, my batshit crazy boss made me come in for a half day on Thursday, and I had to wear pants for some of that day, resulting in pants confusion and a volatile BB market. Friday was terrible, as I had to return to the office for the ENTIRE day, resulting in horrible losses for BB.

The conclusion of my analysis is clear guys. DO NOT WEAR PANTS next week. If your boss won't let you WFH, then quit and go work for your wife's boyfriend.

TL/DR: **DO NOT WEAR PANTS THIS WEEK YOU RETARDS**

311,CLOV,nty1bd,2021-06-07 00:59:58,CLOV - Big Daddy of All Squeezes DD,"**UPDATE 6/08/2021: The squeeze has not happened yet, CLOV is set up nicely for both massive short squeeze and gamma squeeze. Not a single share has been covered, in fact there were more borrows this week (yes Hedges are shameless). I also want to emphasize on the lock up period for CLOV. The insiders cannot sell a single class B shares until the price is $30 for at least 90 consecutive days and have 700 million in cash so no need to fear any insider dumping/dilution like other companies. I have not sold any shares. I expect a much much bigger return for my investment**

I want to start off by saying this is not a post comparing CLOV to GME or AMC. While these stocks have some similarities, particularly being targeted by hedge funds for short squeezes, I’m not going to get into that. This post is for anyone who is somewhat new to investing, still learning about shorts and squeezes, and those of you who are more knowledgeable but want the full picture of what’s going on with this stock. You can also think of this post as a Part 2 to [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CLOV/comments/ngesez/this_is_the_bottom_and_youll_be_top_of_the_world/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Brief description of my last post - it was about the stock reaching its bottom at $6.80 and only going up from there (which was correct).

**TL;DR - Currently, the highest number of options purchased have a strike price between $7-18 for every single month. The goal is to stay above $12 to create a snowball of options being executed, thereby causing a gamma squeeze - the higher the strike price, the higher the limit to execute and the hedges are worse off.**

**What Is Clover Health?**

Clover Health is not just another insurance company. They have combined Medicare insurance services with new patient-centered technology aimed at facilitating the ease and effectiveness of diagnosis, treatment, and most importantly, prevention. This company should not be classified as a health insurance company, but a tech company. Their AI learning and database, Clover Assistant, make it easier for providers to eliminate unnecessary and repetitive lab testing, repetitive diagnoses, and it consolidates a patient’s medical history into one platform. This not only saves the patient headaches from navigating our decentralized healthcare system, but it also saves both patients and insurance companies an enormous amount of money by avoiding duplicated efforts. 

Currently, CLOV covers 66,300 customers across 8 states out of the 61,212,247 Medicare beneficiaries nationwide, which equates to .0011% of the beneficiary population. As you can tell, this number is extremely low, which makes sense since they are a brand new company. When they reach even 1% of the beneficiaries, this company’s stock price would be $100+ based on fundamentals alone. But I expect these numbers to skyrocket as they gain more members and their AI learning database improves more and more.

[CLOV Medicare Advantage Plan by &#37; of growth compared to competitors \(cloverhealth.com\)](https://preview.redd.it/wuoalim07q371.png?width=3297&format=png&auto=webp&s=b38cba4adeb4fcbbeae5d53ea93751964480113a)

CLOV has huge long-term growth potential, so the risk to reward is extremely favorable towards getting into the squeeze. Let me explain why.

**Positive Catalysts**

All the negative catalysts are out of the way and everything is priced in. Here are some positives I’m keeping an eye on: 

* DOJ/SEC case dropping or settling (even if CLOV is found guilty of taking advantage of Medicare, it will still be positive because at max they’ll pay a fine and that’ll be over with). I highly doubt CLOV will be found guilty though because the Hindenburg claims are rather baseless and the DOJ were forced to inquire about this only because it’s related to Medicare. 
* Biden’s health care proposal reducing the Medicare qualifying age below 65 would create millions of new beneficiaries. The hype around the proposal alone will create a huge stock price increase in all healthcare-related stocks, so CLOV will definitely benefit.
* CLOV is officially added to the Russell 3000, who will have to purchase a ton of CLOV shares.
* PR of any new partnership, expanding to further states, and increasing current partnerships. They’re growing rapidly as is, so news like this is bound to come out in the near future.

**The Dark Clouds Surrounding CLOV**

* As previously mentioned, the DOJ inquiry is still lingering and it’s unclear when it will be settled. Although it’s priced in, it is still something to watch out for.
* Hindenturd’s constant attacks despite insisting they don’t have any positions. Why would Hindenburg attack Chamath Palihapitiya even though they aren’t benefiting from it, according to themselves? This relates to the GME/AMC squeeze; Chamath was a big proponent of the push against the hedges. He was outspoken about the squeeze on several occasions and gave GME his validation, which in turn hurt Citadel and other hedges shorting GME immensely. Hindenburg’s report was created to hurt all of Chamath’s IPOs, especially CLOV. Basically, this is retaliation against Chamath for standing with the retail investors, and if I had to take a wild guess, Citadel has paid Hindenburg to write this baseless report. I’ve added a link at the bottom of this post about the Hindenburg allegations and the counter from CLOV for those who were not aware of all the allegations. (PS - Despite all the negative press surrounding Chamath, his track record is stellar.)
* The constant manipulation by short sellers to create negative incentive. For instance, the fake lawsuits by Lifshitz that are shady at best; if you go to their website, you’ll find the phone number listed goes straight to voicemail. All their social media lead to Wix.com platforms instead of their own. And, **THEIR PHYSICAL LOCATION DOES NOT EXIST** as shown in Google Maps. Lots of red flags.

**Let’s get down to the nitty gritty - The Daddy of all Short Squeezes**

CLOV is currently over 42.58% as of Friday, making it the highest shorted stock on paper (and it’s unclear how many naked shorts there are, which could easily be 70-100%+; it’s impossible to know since those shares are shorted illegally). THE SQUEEZE IS INEVITABLE, it’s just a matter of how much more the short interest increases, which will correlate to a bigger squeeze. Furthermore, the borrowed interest on CLOV stock has more than doubled to 3.7%, meaning those who are shorting have to pay much higher interest on borrowing the stocks, and that number will only continue to increase as demand increases. Soon, they won’t be able to borrow anymore stocks and will have to short it naked in order to suppress the price further, essentially digging a gargantuan hole in which to bury themselves.

[CLOV S\/I&#37; as reported by Ortex](https://preview.redd.it/yem0laz57q371.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0602994d6bc0ddc1305c2737a8b1d70de3f7c58)

No need to fear the company dumping their shares or diluting it because the Class B shares are locked up - the directors aren’t able to sell any shares until the stock price stays above $30 for 90 consecutive days or more. The company is $700 million cash flow positive and no debt, therefore there won’t be any dilution.

The P/S ratio is considered a particularly good metric for evaluating young, potentially high growth companies or companies in cyclical industries that may not show an actual net profit every year. Let’s talk about CLOV’s P/S ratio for a moment. 

CLOV’s 2020 revenue was $672.9 million compared to $462.3 million in 2019, which puts it at 45.6% increase in growth. They beat their own expectations and those of analysts by a wide margin. In 2018 and 2019, the market valued tech companies with IPOs at an average of 11.7 and 10.4 times (respectively) their previous 12 month earnings. Conservatively, that would put CLOV at $7 billion market cap, which is around $20+ fair value. But in 2020, that number doubled, which would increase CLOV’s market cap significantly. However, for this consideration, I’m using the 2018/19 valuation to be conservative.

**Bottom Line**

The fair value of CLOV is anywhere from $20-30 fundamentally, which makes it a very risk-free, undervalued stock that has been suppressed by short sellers. But this post is not about the fundamentals - this is about exposing the short sellers’ manipulation of CLOV. On paper, this company is shorted 42.58% (though this is MUCH higher when you include the illegal naked shorts that aren’t reported), making it the highest shorted stock as of Friday. This number could go much higher as short sellers continue to borrow stocks and suppress the price further, which only hurts them more the longer this is shorted. As is common knowledge from previous squeezes, hedge funds are not going to cover anytime soon; they have to be forced by triggering their margins. As the Fed hinted recently, hedge funds are the most leveraged they’ve ever been in the last 20 years, which means retail investors can take advantage of them just like they’ve been taking advantage of retail investors for 100s of years.

I don’t know how much it could squeeze, from $50-150 or much higher, and there’s no telling where the ceiling will end up. The squeeze is inevitable, whether you or I buy it or not, but the process of how long it will take is up to the retail investing community.

312,DD,nmofz4,2021-05-28 05:12:37,"Palantir DD if you want to understand company and it's history better (also insider ""selling"" explained in detail)","This started as a comment reply but I thought maybe people would like reading it. I've been researching Palantir since literally late November 2020 and I have nearly my entire portfolio in LEAPS expiring January 2023. So I have continually done more research on them this is just the basics to clear up confusion and help people who don't understand it because it's hard to hear all the hype and stuff. Also AMC to the moon tomorrow for my FDs I bought!! Don't judge me it's just fun to be in on the action on weeks like this.


So you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable. 

They developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.

 It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.

They fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.

Then for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?

 They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. 



They actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit. Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we're going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI. The amount of government money that's going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is. 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201001005334/en/U.S.-Army-Research-Lab-Selects-Palantir-Technologies-Inc.-for-91M-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Development

This is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in. Sure they're going to experiment with other research but if you do research you'll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts. They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6. The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I'm not even sure if there's more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get. 

But like again I'm an obsessive. I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it's very possible and can make them huge and it will. But I'm actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY. And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do. It's literally the next Manhattan project and they're absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest. I think it's funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be. 




Also people got the insider selling stuff very very wrong. Tom Nash (love him or hate him I don't care) has a few really good recent videos where he explains it in basically full detail what was happening. The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion. 

Basically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price. Well because it's the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments. So everytime karp was exercising he's actually buying shares. Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars. shares. And even those when he exercising he's buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE. So over the last year plus this year he's essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit. So his total income which he's getting taxed at 40% of is in the BILLIONS yes billions. Because that's a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there's no issue it's not even like him saying sell today and they do this.... TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC. That's why it's automatically happening so no one can ever claim he's timing it. 

So listen cause here's where it gets important. The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he's receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn't actually get billions of dollars. So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that. Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised. So everytime he's selling low its actually good for him because it's less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on.

 If he wasn't selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall. So if he thought it was going to tank he'd wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes. 

I know this seems really crazy but I promise that's how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors/youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong. Unbelievable I know. If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like $3-6 dollars not low 20s. Retail got confused because of market pressured due to interest rate fears from inflation and sold low (like retail always does) to institutions.",DD,0.91

331,AMC,nrvwe7,2021-06-04 05:51:11,Serious Question for AMC apes,"To start, I'm retarded and don't understand anything.  I'm hoping someone can help me here, but it's unlikely given the avg. IQ of this sub.  Either way:

I was watching this clip from this spooge-stain Rich Greenfield [here](https://youtu.be/Z9-jJNjdfCs). He said something that kinda surprised me as he bitched and whined about how stupid retail traders are.  First, he said the volume of trades is in the billions, so it's impossible that we are all holding.  That's funny, it sounds like he said the quiet part out loud.

More importantly, he said, ""the fundamentals don't support the valuation"". I'm stupid and don't know that word, so I turned my head sideways to listen at these weird sounds.  He then brought up Cinemark, which he says is ""the exact same company"".  The only differences he uses to separate the two are (1) Cinemark ""has a stronger balance sheet"" and (2) Cinemark is a $5b enterprise value while AMC is at $30b.  

So this stupid ape did some stupid monkey math and 30/5=6.  So far, I think I'm okay.  Now I did more stupid monkey math.  CNK stock price of $23 X 6 = $138 for AMC.  That can't be right, as AMC is trading at $48.

Here is where I'm really retarded and know nothing.  I looked at Market Cap.  It's a number I see all the time and don't know anything about it.  I look at CNK market cap and it is $2.56b.  AMC's market cap is $18.85 muthafuckin billion.  18.85/2.56= 7.36.  7.36X$23/share= $169.  One 69, which is what my wife will give me if this is all correct.  

Help me please.  Tell me how retarded I am, this is.  Please tell me how wrong I am on the FUnDamentals.  Otherwise, I might go full retard and buy some $100 AMC calls with my wife's monnies",Discussion,0.7

333,ASO,nq4abi,2021-06-01 22:51:51,"A forecasted potential earnings Breakdown for AMC, BB, &amp; ASO 😎 from one dork to a bunch of retards","First things first, I hope you all understand that math is scientific, and these numbers will be pretty accurate but with all things finance sometimes assumptions must be made. The assumption being made here is that the stock market will react to AMC, BB, and ASO short squeezes EXACTLY as it did to GME. A true apples to apples comparison of what has happened to GME being applied to our other favorites.

Up first is teaching you how to calculate earning in the form of a percentage. The formula goes like this. (Current Value - initial Cost)÷initial cost x 100= percentage return. 

GmE started at roughly 18$ before it gained squeeze worthy traction and eventually topped out at $483. I chose 18$ as the starting point t because earning up until that point were smooth and slowly trending upwards on a 1 year chart. GmE has 70 Million Shares outstanding. It's 18 to 483 dollars increase gives it a return of 2,583% roughly.

Applying this to AMC goes like this. AMC had a ""pre-surge"" stable price of 10$. 10x25.83=258$ however GME only has 15 percent of the shares outstanding that AMC has so you have to consider the market Cap. $258x.15%= $38.70 expected squeeze price. All variables being the same at its highest AMC could go to $38.70 

BB is going  to be very similar to AMC because of a large market cap. BB ""pre-surge"" stable price is $10 as well, this is being generous because a good argument could be made to use $8-9 but I decided to use 10. So 10x25.83=$258 however GME only has 12% of shares outstanding as BB so that has to be factored in 258x .12%= $30.96  I believe at the height of any BB squeeze due to market cap the price could soar as high as $30 using GME variables.

Here is where things get interesting ASO has a ""pre-surge"" stable price of $30 and GME has 77% of shares outstanding compared to ASO, a Much higher variable, with a much higher starting price, and a higher short interest than BB & AMC. Here we go 30x25.83= 775$ 
775 x.77= $596 squeeze price potential

So in essence we can triple our money or better on AMC & BB depending on when you bought in. AsO has the potential to be HUUUGGE🚀🚀💯😃",DD,0.78
334,CLOV,nvnhz1,2021-06-09 06:47:51,Why CLOV hasn't squeezed yet and will soon! 🚀🌜,"According to the latest rounds of 13-F filings from CITADEL LLC, CITADEL has 724,599 shares of AMC and 514,775 shares of CLOV. This is nor surprising or a concern as CITADEL is such a large hedge fund that they have stake in MANY companies.

Recently, I have seen a lot of inaccurate information being spread that CLOV is a trap set out by the hedgefunds due to CITADEL stake in CLOV but this was just debunked as they have even a larger stake in AMC.

$CLOV

Data for CLOV from FINRA shows that on May 24, 2021, short interest was 36.11% of the float which is very high.  Data provided by ORTEX shows that short interest just this Friday was 42.58%. This  increased to 44.31% on Monday and yesterday's (Tuesday June 8) data was at 45.56% which is another INCREASE in the short interest. 

Even though the stock has sky rocketed in value, the SHORT INTEREST of the free float has NOT DECLINED meaning that a short squeeze has not occurred! Shorts currently are not covering their position. The recent gains in CLOV's stock price is purely from retail investors like us piling in.

If we continue to increase the share price of CLOV, then we will see a HUGE short squeeze and with the short interest of over 40%, that's going to be a very violent move and the return is going to be more that we can imagine! Considering the insane volume of 725 Million yesterday and the fact that it is the most mentioned ticker on WSB yesterday, there is definitely a lot of retail investors piling into CLOV to create a short squeeze.

If everything continues like this with the stock price increasing,  putting more pressure on the shorts, CLOV could ultimately squeeze at a much higher price!

It's the same problem we had with GME a couple months ago - the big difference being BB is still not showing comparable gains, and it's not even shorted. So where is *this* amount of support coming from?

Don't get me wrong - I have shares in BB and would love it to moon, but the amount of AMC/GME FUD going on from new accounts where 100% of their post history is pushing BB or fucking SILVER is blowing my mind. That shit's not organic and we see through your bullshit. Again, I say this as someone who's been holding BB since January.

Just make a Daily Megathread for each of these four stocks and call it a day.

However this is straight from the horses mouth from a Ford Dealership in Canada. They clearly state and clarify this partnership directly on their dealership website. Information I have just come across today.

[https://www.rivercityford.ca/xl-hybrids/](https://www.rivercityford.ca/xl-hybrids/)

What's more is in their latest today that have opened a new Centre in MI today again stating that it's where Ford and GM cars will become electrified.

[https://twitter.com/xlfleet/status/1402634437083471883?s=21](https://twitter.com/xlfleet/status/1402634437083471883?s=21)

I've been watching the level 2 for days and every time volume dries up it's being accumulating. In my opinion they are simply messing with the price.

If you want to read their investors presentation see below.

[https://xlfleet.com/assets/Uploads/PDF/Updated-Investor-Presentation-9.21.20.pdf](https://xlfleet.com/assets/Uploads/PDF/Updated-Investor-Presentation-9.21.20.pdf)

What a lot of people are missing about $XL is they have fingers in every sector of the EV market. 

They have substantial cash reserves of $400,000,000 roughly 1/3 of their market cap so there is no immediate requirement for cash.

**Please read full DD bullet points below:**

**Basic Stats:**

Market Cap: $1b

Public Float 94.4m

Shares Short: 22.11M

Share Float Short: 23.3%

32 days of consolidation at lows meaning an extremely strong base has been put in at this price. Everybody has been shorting during this period is now trapped.

Vanguard loaded up 6,000,000 extra shares with some other funds increasing their positions.

Possible entry into the Russel Index which would see far more cash flow into the name.

On the 26th March 2021 a total of 205,641 shares were awarded to employees at an estimated cost price of $6.81; With a one year lock up. Giving them a massive incentive to hit targets.

XL recently bought WEES in a 50/50 cash and stock deal which again in my opinion is a great buy. World Energy generated $18 million in total revenue and was free cash flow positive for full year 2020. Its acquisition, which closed Monday, is expected to expand XL Fleet’s electric vehicle charging infrastructure capabilities, the company said

XL recently inked a deal with UBS arena to provide charging stations, solar generation and energy storage. For a total of 1,000 charging stations which is one of the largest deployments in the United States.

The company they inked the deal with also owns another 30 properties. Meaning more contracts is a very likely outcome.

They also announced that to cover their current clients who consist of names like Fedex, Coca Cola, Pepsi etc they would need to install over 100,000 charging stations making them the biggest player in the industry.

100's of millions sitting in cash

Finally a Short Float of 23.3% approx 22,000,000 shares short. For a comparison this is more than $AMC and $BB.

The market cap and share float are so small that the room for an explosive move is enormous.

I'm personally looking for a minimum of Shitrons target at $60 a share and based on current future projections

This is of course not financial advice and I'm long, will be buying more dips.",DD,0.87

If you want to inform yourself about this check out NrdRages comment history where he explained the setup multiple times.

Might aswell check out his DD about the company from some time ago in his post history.

This is supposed to be a little reminder about how fantastic Clean Energy Fuels actually is.

What do they do in short?
They take methane, convert it into transportable fuels (RNG), fill up tanks with it and then charge trucks for filling up.

Why is this amazing?

- It's way superior towards electrial charging stations simply because it's faster but also completely enviromentally friendly, which as we all know is the future anyways.

What else is great?

- They have partners such as BP, Total and the Los Angeles Metro.

- They will provide fuel to Amazons truck because these motherfuckers build their refilling stations next to Amazon Warehouses.

- Once the transport industry adapts properly CLNE is in a unique position to profit from the green energy transition.

So we have a company that has a great product, a great setup for succsess with huge partners and a gigantic future ahead.

So yea outside of a potential Gamma Squeeze the company itself is also really solid and it's probably wurth to consider a buy for this one

I am currently holding 200 shares at an average of 9.30$ and planning to add more.

TL;DR
Yes CLNE has a insane setup for a potential gamma squeeze but the company itself has a great product, great partners and a great future so you might want to consider holding it as a long term investment generally",DD,0.88

I understand the majority of the interest on this sub is a few major meme stocks, but I would like to direct attention to a somewhat new ticker.
UWMC is the nations #1 wholesale mortgage lender based out of Michigan. They have a variety of advantages over their competitors in the mortgage field. 
I understand a lot of people are trying to move the sub away from chasing short squeezes, however it is worth nothing that this stock is sitting at 20.5% short interest and the borrow rate is quite high https://iborrowdesk.com/report/uwmc . I have already seen a few posts directed at this stock and it’s potential. I would recommend this quick read as if it details the fundamentals behind this great buy https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nv6f2d/could_uwmc_be_the_next_moonshot/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Not a financial advisor... just bullish! 🚀🚀",DD,0.86
385,UWMC,ngzq1l,2021-05-20 15:06:40,UWMC DD - sizzle and steak,"$UWMC Due Diligence - Don't knock it til you read it, or don't I'm a reddit post not a cop.

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC and its +23% run in the past week. A stock with a massive dividend. A stock trading with a very low P/E of and income growth of 4,200%.

So why is this stock still a buy and hold for me right now?

The CEO is positioning them to increase shareholder value, but also position the company to weather any reduction in the refi market. (65% of the business)

There are major catalysts that have been driving the increase in price that goes beyond the attention gained on WSB.

* Announced **NET earnings of $860M in the first quarter,** with huge margins.
* Reaffirmed a continued dividend, the next ex-dividend date is **6/9/2021**.
* Announced a **$300M stock buyback, representing as much as 40% of the free float** at the current prices.
* Russell index inclusion was missed last quarter due to confusion about their PREVIOUS status as a SPAC. It is expected that they will be reconsidered for Russell Index inclusions in the yearly reconstitution. While not the biggest catalyst, this is a sign of reputation and long-term stability for the stock. **The prelim list publishes 6/4/2021.**
* Creation of a jumbo mortgage product. The average loan origination in the market is \~410,000, indicating that the non-conforming section of the mortgage market is *exploding.* This is a very profitable sector of loan origination.

Other fundamentals driving a buy recommendation:

* Small float. 90M float, of which only about 60M is freely trading.
* This stock is not persistently pressured down quite as hard as others due to low share availability, but it appears based on the last two weeks it's trading the small waves of this stock to try to push it down under dangerous strike prices. A wave of positive sentiment could strangle this position in the stock. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, but based on the evidence over the last several days, the indication is the 13.1% SI has grown.
* Exceptional open option interest for **tomorrow 5/21/2021.** The options expiring tomorrow have been documented elsewhere so I won't belabor them, but the open interest at the $9, and $10 strike represent almost 10% of the free float.
* Not a new startup, **they have been in this business since 1986**, making them almost as old as a fossil like me. They clearly survived the 2008 storm. This company isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

The cherry:

* **STILL forecasting growth in Q2**, whereas many of its competitors are not.

This post is NOT financial advice, but as someone who has ridden the waves of this stock since it was about $9, I see this position turning positive and the outlook through July for this position has high sentiment. Even if the mortgage market slows down as expected, I will hold these shares for years to come for the dividends and general stability of the organization.

My position 8000 shares @ 7.65 and 45x 6/18 8c. You can go stalk the fuck out of me if you want to see that I've been talking about this stock for some time and been saying the same thing about the strength and targets of their position since March. I am also the guy that tells you when you unintentionally reveal personal info on your yolo screenshots!

TLDR: UWMC should garner close attention for value investors looking for undervalued positions.

can't stop the work.

396,EV,nmcz56,2021-05-27 19:42:04,"This is my EV play. DD on BB, SONY, VW, Volvo.","Hey all - I am a huge auto enthusiast and been following the industry closely. This is how I’m betting on EVs.

BB:
60 $30c 01/2022 at $0.27
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀


Already powering many of the telematics of current cars, BB is poised to benefit from their established relationships with big automakers. Getting certified with an automaker is not easy, so it is a barrier to entry for other companies wanting in on the action. Security and reliability are top of mind for these companies. You don’t want your car to get hacked easily, so what better than a cybersecurity company that happens to also do EV software, and already has experience with ICE cars. I did a long DD here 4 months ago and still stand by it: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxknrl/bb_dd_9_reasons_why_bb_is_from_former_bb_employee/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf


SONY:
100 shares at $101
🚀🚀🚀


I wouldn’t call this the Japanese equivalent for BB, as they aren’t a cybersecurity company. But Sony has a thriving consumer and B2B business that benefits greatly from consumer demand: the fact that they are literally selling every single PS5 they make is amazing and image sensors going out on many cell phones, including Apple using both image and lidar sensors from Sony. Great solid volume of sales to stabilize the company after some stagnant years.

On PS5, it’s actually a good thing that there’s a chip shortage. As Sony loses money on the hardware (and earn on game royalties and licenses), they are buying time to refine their manufacturing to lower costs, and lose less money on hardware sales. And because demand is so hot for the PS5, they are on track to build a bigger platform than even PS4 to charge 20-30% on every game they sell. That’s some fat margin.

Now, you’re probably wondering…wtf, I’m here to read about EVs, why you telling me about PS5s? Yeah, you’re right but a conglomerate like Sony is multifaceted. While they build up their EV software platform, they have cash cows in imagery and video games. And if Apple is really building an EV, I would bet (am literally betting) that they would rely on currently trusted partners like Sony for their imaging needs. You sit inside an Apple car and camera recognizes who you are and where you’re sitting? Well that’s probably a Sony camera…or 20 of them. There will be so many cameras inside and outside of any Apple car. I mean…my iPhone 12 has 4 cameras, and it’s a tiny slab of glass and my family can’t sit inside and drive down the road with others in the environment.

And when Japanese automakers get into EVs, they’ll look into a Japanese partnership. Guess who’s probably in pole position?

Full disclosure, I also have 150 AAPL.



VW:
200 shares @ $33.32
🚀🚀🚀🚀

You are all excited about Ford. I am too but I’m not buying into them because I think they are overhyped. But what’s interesting about Ford’s EV play is that they are partnering with VW to do so. That means…even if Ford can’t sell that many cars, VW will probably still benefit from joint research development and cost sharing. We also know how much more climate change is viewed as reality in Europe, and that’s VW’s home territory. VW already launching EVs under Audi, Porsche in the premium sector, VW, Skoda and Seat in the value sector, and Bentley and Lamborghini will likely have their ultra premium EVs soon.

But you might wonder…what about Tesla? They are so great! Well yeah they aren’t that bad. But VW is a goddamn monster. It’s kind of cute when Tesla announces a new plant, oh this is my 4th plant! We now have Shanghai and Fremont and building out Berlin and Austin. That’s cute. VW has 136 plants around the world. The economies of scale is insane and will be able to source materials for incredibly better deals. Oh and there’s that other partner called Ford who builds millions of cars a year also jumping into to beat on suppliers to give them both better pricing. Welcome to the big leagues, EVs.

VW is likely to launching 5-10 EVs per year, the equivalent the full Tesla line up every year. And they have Electricfy America network (and Canada) and similar in Europe.

And one more thing: VW also does trucks. Like 18 wheeler trucks. They are one of the biggest manufacturers, behind brands such as Man, Scania, and Navistar. And trucks have even more of a compelling business case for EVs…Will merge this part with Volvo.


Volvo:
800 shares @ $26
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀


Going to keep this briefer because this is already a novel. Now, when I say Volvo, I don’t mean Volvo Cars. That’s bought by Geely and yes they are making EVs under Volvo and Polestar brands. But I’m taking about AB Volvo, still out of Sweden, building trucks, mining equipment, backhoes, haul trucks and cranes.

EVs are so more more compelling because of the use and mileage they get. It’s not uncommon for a one year old truck to have a million miles. And as cities around the world clamp down on urban center access (congestion or polluter fees common in Europe, and allow EVs in for discount or free), EVs increasingly make more sense. You save so much on lower op/maintenance costs, avoiding tolls and tax credits. Oil prices will be going back up so saving on fuel costs is the smart thing to do.

Another thing is, governments around the world are spending trillions on infrastructure stimulus. What do these trillions buy? Concrete, steel, Volvo construction equipment, labor. Where does the concrete, steel and other commodities (like rising gold and silver prices) come from? They get mined out of the ground with big Caterpillar, Liebherr and Volvo equipment. Yep, there’s Volvo again!

So if you believe stimulus is happening, Volvo is a good choice. If you believe inflation is real, Volvo is a good choice. If you believe EV is the future for hauling shorter distances and/or heavy loads, Volvo is a good choice.

What do you think, time to load more?


**Main points of the statement:**

* As previously disclosed, there were 501,780,240 shares outstanding as of June 2, 2021, the record date for the Shareholder Meeting scheduled for July 29, 2021.

* As of June 2, there were approximately 4.1 million1 individual shareholders eligible to vote at the upcoming Shareholder Meeting.

* Advance voting will begin on June 16, with most shareholders eligible to vote by internet through 11:59 PM Eastern Daylight Time on July 28.

* AMC’s definitive proxy statement will be filed on June 16. Shortly thereafter, voting materials and a notice of the Shareholder Meeting will be sent to individual investors. Such investors are encouraged to reach out to their brokers in the latter part of June or early in July if these materials have not yet been received from their brokers.

I want to talk about some other information on this stock. If the squeeze doesn't work out then it's good to hold an undervalued (at current prices) stock right?

**Valuation:**

Earning is negative as they are still heavily spending and growing

P/S of 1.67 (as of 6/7 closing) is industry low, suggesting that they are undervalued (compared to AMZN 3.82, BABA 5.2, PDD 13.8, EBAY 3.92, ETSY 10.54, W 2.27)

**numbers from the latest** [8-k](https://sec.report/Document/0001157523-21-000651/) **and** [10-q](https://sec.report/Document/0001564590-21-027024/)**:**

Revenue $772m, up 70% Q/Q. Wish is spending heavily on sales and marketing, $470m last quarter (61% of revenue). They have been consistently spending \~60% to 70% of revenue on sales and marketing, and they anticipate reducing this to 40-45%, at which point they will likely be profitable. Comparing to ETSY for example, ETSY is only spending $151m out of $551m revenue (27%) last quarter. Of course ETSY is in the black - they are just not spending as much to grow. Meanwhile ETSY has a $21.6B valuation on $2B sales compared to WISH's $5B valuation on $2.87B sales.

One of the concerns cited by analysts is the drop in monthly active users (MAUs) from 109m to 101m Q/Q. The explanation given by WISH is that they decided to de-emphasize in emerging markets due to logistic issues during the pandemic. But I anticipate that they will ramp back up. For example [WISH recently partner with the south african postal services](https://www.businessinsider.co.za/global-online-store-wish-has-struck-a-deal-with-the-sa-post-office-to-deliver-products-faster-2021-4), indicating that they are going back to growth in emerging markets.

**Balance book:**

WISH has $1.6B cash. \~$2B total assets, \~$1.1B total liabilities, giving $930m equity.  For a growth company these numbers are excellent. Again comparing to ETSY, $1.16B cash, $2.5B total assets, $1.8B total liabilities, $684m equity. 

**Insider selling:**

Another concern that a lot of people have is the amount of insider selling. First of all, it's normal for insiders to cash out for a new IPO company like this. This is certainly done with scheduled sales - they wouldn't want to sell at like 30% of IPO prices either but they couldn't change the scheduled sales. This on top of short seller has driven the prices to <50% of IPO prices, <30% of ATH. I think the insiders would certainly be reconsidering their next selling schedules, and we may see less selling pressure.

**Technicals:**

Again, the stock is near all time low, and at <50% of IPO prices, <30% of ATH. The spike today poked out of a descending wedge and a breakout looks very promising.

**Conclusions:**

From a pure price point of view, it's an excellent entry point into WISH, even after today's spike. I think this is a low risk, high reward play at it's current price. In the bull case, WISH gets a valuation similar to ETSY, and that would make WISH have a market cap of $25B for a share price of $40. For the bear case, I don't see how WISH can drop much more. Let's say it goes to $5, that would make it have a market cap of $3B with a P/S of \~1, and that would be absurd.",DD,0.74

&#x200B;

Option volume is a fraction of yesterday's for $WISH and $CLOV at this time. Lot's of ITM option volume (could be sales) and smaller volume OTM

&#x200B;

Might start taking profits now and see how the day goes

&#x200B;

$WISH:

Big price ramps from $10; $12.5; and $15 - doesn't look like it's  only retail buying  after-hours and pre-market. How many of the people here actually have permission to buy during pre-market or post-market hours?

&#x200B;

Next ramp is at $17.50 but the real money gonna be in the $20s. So much call contracts traded yesterday at the $20 strike

How high can $WISH go?

Pre-market is at $15 with a volume gap and no resistance until $20. From $20 upwards, the path is rockier BUT... We did see a lot of call volume at $20 and even more at $25. So if price reaches and is able to break that higher resistance up to $25, then it's fly high land

&#x200B;

$CLOV:

Same buying pattern, steady increasing. Now in $CLOV we didn't have higher option strikes than $22. They are available today tho. So keep checking the volume on the new strikes to estimate where this is going. Yesterday's option volume was   I N S A N E

The stock is up 64% since the close on 5/13, through 5/19. Closing volume has ramped up steadily over the same period from 6.3m to 42.4m

Two major catalysts are on the near horizon:

1) Earnings report on 5/24 AH: Confirmation of late Q3 production and disclosure of binding orders have a high probability of being announced.

2) Lordstown Week (June 21-25): Plant open house for tours, test drives, etc., and above all else, transparency.  This should alone should put the final nail in the shorts coffin.

It's still not too late to jump on the $RIDE train and ***squeeze*** the life out of the naysayers. All aboard!

\- Research coming out of John Hopkins University is suggesting that the use of Psilocybin is the most effective drug ever tested as a remedy for depression, anxiety, and PTSD. As the United States is currently under crisis in its battle against mental illness, these results are too impressive to ignore, even if it may need to overcome pressures from big pharma interest groups that seek to quell the expansion of this research.

\- These drugs have been extremely effective in treating addiction -- particularly alcohol and nicotine. Considering the government expenditure on the opioid crisis, once this proves to be an effective treatment, the government will expedite the medicinal legalization of the substances that MNMD has been treating/experimenting with.

\- Veterans, the most respected occupational category (statistically,) have begun launching advocacy groups for the widespread medicinal legalization of these substances due to their effectiveness against PTSD. These therapeutic measures have contributed to the plummeting of suicide rates (those treated w/ psilocybin vs. control group.) The Biden administration will have to choose ethics and reason over the suffering of veterans (former government employees) which I anticipate that they will given mounting pressure due to the effectiveness of these treatments.

&#x200B;

Does this hinge on expected earnings in the long-run ... certainly!

&#x200B;

But the effectiveness of this research is undeniable and can no longer be overlooked ... because of new cultural acceptance of these alternative treatments the government's hand will be forced in legalize, or otherwise be responsible for mental illness and addiction -- all of which could be treated and cured.

Dear retards,

Today  I was doing my DD’s and while doing my wacc, roe and other bullshit  analysis I had the smart idea to have a look at the Short Interest of  sndl.

While looking at it I was  astonished by the data reported by Bloomberg terminal. Our  short-interest ratio is 1.44, while amc is only 0.53 and gme 1.45  (source: Bloomberg terminal).

This means that the number of shorted shares is 1.44 times higher than the average trading volume which is absolutely crazy!!!!

The  percentage of the float is around 15%, however, the data of float  percentage has not been updated yet. IMO we could easily be at around  20, as gme and amc.

The main thing differentiating us from AMC and GME is the SI Score provided by Bloomberg terminal à 2nd

amc is just 5th whereas gme 4th

To conclude the S3 rate temperature, indicating the seasoned financing levels with 1, 50 or 100

1= Liquid borrows typically indicating a short interest at or below historic terms

50= Marginally higher borrow levels typically indicating somewhat elevated short interest

100= Increased borrow levels typically indicating elevated short interest.

We  are currently at 50, ( gme stands at 1 (source Bloomberg terminal)) and  even in this case, the data have not yet been updated from the previous  month….

The SQUEEZE is near we all need to hold sundial !!!!

Cheers and have a good day y’all degenerates

P.S. This is not a financial advice, I’m just posting for fun and for educational purpose. Have a good day and make DD’s :)

EDIT: short TLDR by u/turnerdhr23 

"" The shorts doubled up in May, from 11 million shares in April to 18.5 million shares in May. Up over 50% from April short numbers. They are trying everything they can, but you can’t fight buybacks, dividend on 6/9, inclusion in MSCI and Russell, and technicals switching to bullish. They are paying insane 70%+ interest on borrowed shares too. It’s a perfect storm. Got my popcorn ready. ""

Price action has been very nice the last few days with shorts climbing as price does steadily aswell. Approximately 20%+ of the float is being shorted according to TD. Also with this run up you bet your ass they are all in the red. Like I said in my last post, the company is currently buying back shares as of last week - so the float is likely smaller reported making the short % even higher.

With ex dividend coming up on 6/9 (match made in heaven) these shorts are sweating bricks because they know they need to cover or they will have to pay out that dividend for each share shorted on a losing position. As you are seeing towards the end of today they were trying to dump the price - likely done with even more shorts probably with the idea once they dump it enough they can cover this shit position and run. Chart below shows how its almost impossible for any short to be in the green.

[Also Schwab is telling me this is hard to borrow \(high short float\)](https://preview.redd.it/rbvjtk2zmi171.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=310642d4e17a29527ee49cc3ec4ec3780840d0c0)

DO NOT SELL HERE - the pump hasn't even started to begin Wall ST shits on the company because it was a SPAC so they shorted the fuck out of it and have been having a cash fiesta since the merger crashing the price down to laughable numbers.

THE ADVANTAGE WE HAVE IS OUR AWARENESS OF OUR RETARDATION THESE AUTISTIC HEDGE FUNDS THINK THEY ARE SMART AND CAN CONTROL PA TO ALWAYS WIN. THEY SOMEHOW THINK THAT WE ARE TO PREOCCUPIED WITH AMC AND GME BUT THEY DONT REALISE NO FUND IS SAFE.

Execute contracts if possible - I dont think there are enough shares out there to cover all these positions

TLDR: UWMC over shorted and they will have no choice to cover or pay out the dividend by 6/9 unless they can crash the price by shorting more.... Sounds familiar

Positions: shit load of shares, 8/20 $6 calls that will be executed before ex dividend. 8/20 $7 calls, the cheap play that i just loaded on are the 6/18 $9 calls. DO AS YOU WISH SHARES WILL WIN NO MATTER WHAT BUT PROVIDE LESS TENDIES",DD,0.88

So id just like to give my perspective on what I'm seeing on the charts. Its all in the eye of the beholder so take it as a grain of salt. This TA has helped me make money and, I believe, gives me an edge. But to each his own. If you are making money with your own method then congratulations. Not gonna poo all over you if it doesn't align with my method and strategies.

From the [5/21 read post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nhrou0/i_spy_521_read/)

A few things in TA my notes:

* called support and resistance levels.
* Called small moves
* Called that bulls need to break 418 and test 418 as support. As you can see we failed bulls.
* But bears did not break 414.
* Also called out a 20 SMMA test. Which we tested and failed.

I'd like to address this chart and comment:

""Now please tell me which SMMA is acting as as support and which one as a resistance here? 60-day SMMA is definitely not a support because SPY was below that line half of the trading hours. 20-day SMMA is not a resistance because SPY was above that line for almost one third of the market hour.""

[ To express what I see I'll provide my chart:](https://preview.redd.it/0ghkrgvhkr071.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=b99e69494648928d9891cb025a1da6b33f94835f)

Let's go back to the 20th first.

* 20 SMMA acted as support and was tested three times throughout the day on the 20th.
* The 20 SMMA would have played as a great indicator to BTFD for Friday.

Now lets focus on friday:

Taking this comment into account: ""Now if you believe in these indicators and bought 0 DTE FD calls as a hope that 60-day SMMA will save you, you know what would happen.""

Let's look at the RSI at the blow off top.  If you started buying O'Hare calls here then you belong in this sub.

TLDR - use basic ta for support and resistance. Use more than one indicator to confirm trends. Read my posts as conditional statements. If you have questions - ask - BUT don't be a dick. I provide bullish and bearish pts because like everyone else I don't know where the market is going to go in the future. SMMAs are a great tool but not good used by themselves. Use them to determine strength of trends IMO. Use them for shorting and buying opportunities off of bounces and rejections.

450,WELL,nvncdw,2021-06-09 06:38:16,WELL Health Is The Canadian CLOV... Now They're Doing a NASDAQ IPO with Fenwick &amp; West who Just Completed The COIN IPO!!!,"Obviously CLOV has gotten all the attention as of recent. CLOV was up 85% today and had volume over 732M. The reddit army has taken charge and sent CLOV to truly to the moon. 

I want to share what I think is lining up to be the next CLOV... 

Still largely under the radar is Vancouver based WELL Health Technologies (TSX:WELL) which also has significant short interest, strong fundamentals , and billionaire backers. They just completed a $206M acquisition of “MyHealth” now making it the largest private clinic operator in Canada.

Just prior to that, the company recently announced the $372.9M Acquisition of CRH medical which significantly increased WELLs footprint in the US... This is where it gets interesting. Not only did JP Morgan extend there existing credit line to CRH medical by USD$100M to $300M and RBC provide a C$200M secured credit facility for the recent “MyHealth” acquisition. 

But the company legit partnered with Fenwick & West to assist with a NASDAQ IPO in Q4 of this year.... Fenwick client base is Facebook, Amazon, Cisco, and recently COIN... We are on a launch pad waiting to take off. 

Jumping into the charts now... WELL has consolidated for a year while they have exponentially grown the fundamentals of the business. Just recently they blew through every moving average.

RSI is still below 60% and heading in the right direction - Stochastics finally hit that oversold zone and have started to aggressively turn bullish. 

&#x200B;

Today we saw the stock find new support on the 50day SMA for a strong close.

I think it's very likely we see this breakout of its consolidation period tomorrow and find new support above 8.50 which would set it up for a potential Squeeze/Run into new ATH.

The sky is really the limit here as the company approaches $500M in revenue with Positive EBITDA and a NASDAQ IPO on the horizon. I think it has the potential to be 1 of 2 things.

459,UWMC,neetnp,2021-05-17 14:23:47,$200K all-in because I believe that $UWMC is undervalued. CEO agreed undervalued and declared a buyback to retire class A float (only class that gets dividends). BULLISH trend this week!," 

I  have shared my thoughts on UWMC in past. The company announced Q1  earnings and while they look like they are below expectations it was  explained by the CEO that because of the speed of their execution, their  results are reflective of the higher rate environment already while  competitors are lagged.

During    the Q4 2020 earnings call he  had mused about options that would be on    the stable, special dividend,  buyback or raising the dividend.

**Feb Q4 Earnings Quote:**

The     Board did approve a dividend, a $0.10 quarterly dividend to be  paid    on  April 6 for all shareholders of record as of March 10. **We expect  this to be a regular quarterly dividend**.

And     so you guys know how we're thinking about this. Our balance sheet   is  a   fortress. And our current liquidity position is very strong, and    we   have access to the capital markets as well. The way we think  about   this   going forward is we're producing a lot of cash. We're  going to   maybe   be more profitable than some expected and be very  successful in   2021.   And **if we have excess cash that I and the Board deem is too much,  we will be delivering that back**. And whether we have to **change     the  dividend in the future, as in raise it or a special dividend,     those  things are definitely on the table or even buying back shares**.

**May Q1 Earnings Quote:**

As     you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of      $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a      record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I always  **explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special  dividend or a share buyback program**. As you guys have seen, we **concluded      share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward   shareholders.    We announced the authorization of $300 million share   buyback over the    next 24 months**.  And **quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that**.

**Then in answering a question from an analyst**

Doug    Harter -  Great. And then just in terms of capital return, you    mentioned sort of  the float. I  guess just how are you thinking about    kind of **how much of  the float  you'd be willing to take out and pacing around share  repurchase**?

Mat Ishbia -  Yes, Doug. So I'm learning these rules as we go **because at this stock  price, I'm a buyer, right**?    And so we'll buy shares as soon as tomorrow, I  think, as our legal    teams say we're allowed to do. And so I don't know  how many I can buy    and what I can do, but I'm very conscientious of the  float.  If the    float was not a concern, **we'd be more aggressive**. However,  **we     have authorization from the Board to buy up to $300 million, and I'm      going to take advantage of that opportunity while being  conscientious     of our partners in the float.**

TL/DR:     UWMC and their board have been looking at ways to give back to     shareholders. Instead of a short term cash out, they decided on a     buyback that they are planning to exercise immediately on so that they     can retire shares while the SP is low. They will NOT buy so much that   it   will ruin their float % for Russell. The CEO is aggressive, has    approval to spend $300 and he's going to take FULL advantage.  The CEO has stated he is a BUYER! They are  not   waiting, it's being deployed now.

Disclosure I am still in long position with 25K  at 8.39 USD shares of UWMC

460,CLOV,nvi64u,2021-06-09 01:51:30,Our Four Leaf $CLOV 🍀,"Dear Apes, I'm writing to you today to tell you a few things. I see many people not understanding and wanting to. A lot of people spreading misinformation, etc. I want to clear the air and inform you, crayon eaters.

Welcome to WSB (Wall Street Bets) Reddit, the home of the Apes 🦍. We collectively are considered one of the largest hedge funds in the world. There are many baby crayon-eating apes who are eager to eat some tasty bananas 🍌. Many of you question how any of us make money, so please feel free to ask questions 💬 in the comments as I will be answering as many as possible, although keep in mind I am not a financial advisor, I simply love the stonks.

**The main topic and example today is $CLOV.** You've most likely been hearing a lot about it. Let me explain the hype behind our four-leaf clover and what you need to expect and do to make some crispy chicken tenders (currency).

$CLOV is a very shorted stock currently with an approximate short float of 50% (please correct me if I'm wrong). A short in simple terms is when someone bets on the stonk going down in value. They 'borrow' the stonk at $50, and give it back to the lender at the lower price of $20. Profiting $30. But here's the catch. If they 'borrow' the stonk at $50 and it going up to $100, they must buy the stonk at $100. Which will raise the price of the stonk. Make sense?

**Good. Now, what causes the short squeeze?** Truth is many factors. WSB as a whole usually rally around certain (meme) stonks that are either undervalued and/or highly shorted. Once we do it causes a jump in price. The shorts wet themselves from a gamma squeeze (high volume trading from Apes dumping all tendies into a stonk). This causes them to eventually have to pay back their shorts at a ridiculous price and in turn, causes the stock to go up.

**What is the perfect recipe?** Well, because it's so highly shorted and we have a ton of Apes hoping on the stonk going to the moon, they've bet on it. Opening many contracts on the four-leaf clover. Once the price reaches above a certain value, many will 'exercise' their contracts (which means actually purchase their shares at the 'strike' price they set it to. Causing a huge influx of shares to be taken at once.)

**Is it too late to purchase $CLOV?** No, it's not. Is it going to go up? It depends on us. If you hold, the shorts will need to pay those bananas back to us at a higher price. Did you get it too late? If you purchased below $25 so far, you will profit if you hold. $CLOV isn't as much of a meme stonk as you think. They have great fundamentals and actually are a great business. So everyone that has purchased, don't worry. You'll profit if you hold. What you're seeing now is only a gamma squeeze caused by us, and everything is going to plan.

**What will the price hit? When do I sell?** Good question, no one ever knows. But I can tell you personally, this will hit $50 no problem. The stonk market is a scary place. There is always a risk, but this risk, for now, is limited.

**Did I miss out? Should I buy it now?** It's up to you, I'm not s financial advisor. Personally, I'm doubling down tomorrow at open, no matter the price. So do what you must with that information.

To all of those stuck on AMC and GME. This is not for you. This is also not a distraction from either of those. Feel free to go with your gut. What I'm telling you, is there is tons of opportunity here, and there will be enough tendies for everyone.

Apes, stay calm, follow the drill. I wish every single one of you, the best of luck. 🍀 After all, we have the $CLOVer on our side. 👍

AMA 🗣️

Edit: On June 18th many options contracts expire. So expect tons of movement in the coming days in an upward trend. Expect price drops a day or two before June 18th as paper hands try and exit. Don't fret, it will go back up. 🎢 Also, NO SHORTS HAVE COVERED THEIR POSITIONS YET. This means this hasn't even begun yet. The next few days will be interesting.

Edit June 9th, 2021: Some may be very worried about the price dropping a tiny bit. This is something that happens with stocks. I call these types of fluctuations routine. I personally will continue to hold as it's clear that these fluctuations are perfectly natural and healthy. For me, there is absolutely no reason to sell or even worry.

468,CLNE,nv2z8i,2021-06-08 14:32:08,CLNE share issueing - bringing clarity to all fellow apes,"Yesterday the CLNE stock dipped AH and all the information provided on this sub was like rip clne gang, they issue shares. I didnt see any sources and contradictory information so I thought its time to do my own DD and share with you fellow apes.

What was released yesterday:

Basically it was 2 informations that were announced yesterday by sec filings, that I will go into here in clother detail.

**1. 8-K Sec Report:**
This is basically the information about the issueing of shares by CLNE through Goldman Sachs or alternatively towards Goldman Sachs at market prices. CLNE had such an agreement before that allowed it to sell shares up to a Volume in USD of 100M. The new agreement in the report does also allow CLNE to sell shares up to a volume of 100M USD from time to time in the future when they want to. This is important, as yesterday some statements mentioned that it would be 100M shares which is not the case. At current marketvalue of CLNE we are speaking of 5% of the company which would lead to, when fully used, a dilution of 5% but on the other hand giving CLNE 100M to invest in infrastructure etc.      
Within the supplement to the 8-k it describes it as follows:     
*We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for developing
and acquiring RNG production projects, building fueling stations to
support contracted RNG fueling volume, and general corporate
purposes.*.   


If you believe in the company and its business model you will likely come to the conclusion that 5% share dilusion might make sense when 100M can be invested and increase the value of the company by more than 100M. In contrary to other stocks the raised money will likely not be used to avoid bankruptcy but to build further income streams.



**2. Total Marketing Service selling shares:**
Total, one of the partnerships of CLNE has more than 46M shares of CLNE that they are able to sell and a total voting power of more than 64M shares. According to the SEC filing they will sell some of those shares from time to time. On the 3rd and 4th of June they sold a total of 538T shares representing 0,0025% of the total shares of CLNE.

**Conclusion:**
Everyone should draw his or her own conclusions from the above mentioned facts. I hope I could give all of you apes a clearer picture what CLNE and the news from yesterday in depth are.

It's the most shorted stock which many are aware but is there a fundamental reason to buy other than a squeeze? I'm no expert on EV battery companies. Let me say that again, I am no expert. But they've  had my interest for awhile now. 

What are your thoughts? Any competitors you are bullish on that you like better? And why? Additionally, anyone familiar with future contracts Workhorse might be vying for? I know they lost out on  the USPS contract but anyone here heard through the grapevine of some big ones in the near future? Again, EV battery companies are not my forte.

Everything looked to have gone off successfully. We are now waiting on the data and craft to be analysed and inspected. This will take a few weeks according to Michael Colglazier.
That being said he had already outlined the test schedule in the earnings zoom call.

1st test flight - may 
2nd crewed flight - June 
3rd flight with R Branson on board late June/July 

4th flight this will be taking the Italian airforce on a training mission (600k a seat) late July


On the run in to the first test flight some possible maintenance issues appeared with the carrier plane White knight 2…. 
This indeed could have gone either way , after 2 weeks inspections it was decided that WK2 did not need to delay testing no maintenance was needed at this point. Scheduled Maintenance will commence in the fall after all tests have been completed.
Upon this news it is my opinion that the testing programme will go ahead as planned.

The market has responded accordingly and the stock is now up from $17-€31

With all these catalysts lined up before the end of the year and commercial operations looming for early 2022 things are looking up for Virgin Galactic.The success of the last test flight the company have now proven tech and concept. 
Also with revenue now coming in Nasa who are conducting micro gravity analysis.
Also international training for military pilots and astronauts.

The FED only has two options at the moment:

Raise rates to curb current inflation. This would cause the treasury to raise its coupon rates (bond interest), which would mean lower bond prices. This means the government has to pay higher interest, ultimately leaving the treasury no other option than defaulting on its obligations.

2. The FED doesnt raise rates, and lets inflation (and later hyperinflation) eat away at the dollar. This would also make the bonds worth less, as theyd have to lower the price to compensate for the interest being worth nothing. In this situation, the fed would be the only one willing to hold government bonds which would worsen the inflation as they effectively dont get payed interest on it.

Option one, the government goes bankrupt due to interests being to high to pay back. Option two, the public goes bankrupt due to hyperinflation.

Either way, a short position would profit in this trade.

483,WKHS,nqxtej,2021-06-03 00:10:41,Is WKHS next to moon???,"Common sense tells me **Workhorse (WKHS)** will take off.

Allow me to summarize:

1. Workhorse develops electric trucks.
2. We all know where the future is going with electric vehicles. The people want it, the government wants it, and a lot of private and public money is being poured in to make this happen. Legislation is aiming to make and force this to happen.
3. The government wants zero emissions. Workhorse trucks are already zero-emission. Gas and diesel-powered trucks are not. These companies are going to have a tough time catching up.
4. Workhorse has a proprietary system to help manage its fleet and increase its efficiency. This helps increase revenue.
5. Cathie Wood of Ark Investment Management, who has been very popular lately (google her), has purchased a few million shares for her fund
6. In April, Workhorse **more than doubled its production** of trucks in comparison to the **combined previous three quarters**. The Pride Group placed an order for 6230 trucks. That's **6230!!! That's an enormous amount of trucks.** They couldn't produce this because of global limitations. There is a bottleneck within the global supply chain in part due to offshore shipping delays of commodity raw materials and components. This has affected the entire industry, including Ford and GM. This is only **TEMPORARY** and will get worked out as it always does because every company wants to sell and make money.
7. Sales for the first quarter of 2021 were approximately $521,000 compared to approximately $84,000 in the first quarter of 2020. That is a significant increase.
8. The Company had approximately $205.1 million in cash in March 2021. This helps limit the need to acquire debt.
9. The stock has recently been beaten down due to having lost out on a $6 billion contract with the USPS. This makes for a prime opportunity to invest in this company. This one-time contract will not be the only contract that the USPS offers nor does it mean Workhorse will lose out on other contracts from the USPS or other companies.
10. 350,00 delivery trucks are sold per year according to the New York Times. This number will most likely increase.
11. Calls with a strike price of $15 for Jun 18, 2021 had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options. This may mean investors may be expecting a big move.
12. You're helping the environment by investing in this company.
13. **MOST IMPORTANTLY, this stock has about a 40% short of its float.** You want to give it to the hedge funds and the short sellers? You want to get in early on a short squeeze? This is the opportunity to make it happen. AMC was shorted about 20% on its float and look what it did. **WKHS is shorted about doubled that!!!**

TLDR

Workhorse (WKHS) is a highly-shorted (nearly 40%) stock with the potential for a very lucrative future. It is still priced pretty low. There is tremendous potential for gains here. Someone please try and prove me wrong. I beg you to try and prove me wrong.

Disclaimer: this is not financial advice.

I’m big on studying trends and I believe I have found a 2-3 bagger for you retards. I’ve been following $RIDE for about 2 months now, and I noticed the potential for a short squeeze beginning to form last week. I’ve noticed the propensity to squeeze comes from the following criteria:

* Short % of float must be over 20% ([over 28% of $RIDE’s float is short](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ride); probably closer to 30-32% since it was last updated)
* Small/Mid Cap stocks with considerable growth prospects ($RIDE has a $1.6B market cap) in a hyper-growth EV industry
* Heavily controversial stock, meaning some say it is way overvalued, some say it is undervalued

These stocks tend to be the most volatile. The charts are often comical to even look at (feel free to check out $RIDE’s 6-month chart for reference).

**$MVIS comparison:**

Taking a look at $MVIS, I noticed that Hindenburg research targeted them in a short & distort attack a few months ago.

I actually googled “Hindenburg MVIS” and the second article that popped up was titled “Technically Incompetent Short Seller Hindenburg Makes False Statements About MicroVision.” This bodes very poorly for Hindenburg, as they seem to have started to formulate a lot of their claims out of thin air.

More recently, Hindenburg targeted $RIDE with the same tactics. They called out $RIDE’s pre-orders for their trucks, while almost all EV companies are utilizing pre-orders, this[ has been clear ever since $RIDE went public](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/16/2127140/0/en/Lordstown-Motors-Releases-Business-Updates-Remains-on-Track-to-Begin-Production-of-the-Lordstown-Endurance-in-September-2021.html) last year.

I found a good[ rebuttal post for Hindenburg’s attack on $RIDE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkt7qi/the_bullcase_for_lordstown_motors_corporation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on this sub from not too long ago as well.

**$RIDE Intro:**

Lordstown Motors ($RIDE) is currently developing their [full-size all electric Endurance truck](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/endurance). They have an[ experienced management team](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/corporate-governance/management) with multiple execs from companies like Tesla, Volkswagen, GM, Honda, etc; also, GM’s investment in exchange for their [massive 6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/) helped them hit the ground running. They are targeting commercial fleets and government contracts with their truck initially. Their trucks will be $45,000 after tax credits and get a 75mpg equivalent. They also will require very little maintenance as they utilize true 4 wheel drive with hub motors in each wheel.

Discussing their[ full-year 2020 results](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020) on March 17th, $RIDE management confirmed that “Timeline to Start of Production (SoP) in September 2021 remains on track, with beta prototype build underway and the first beta vehicles to be ready by the end of March; vehicles to be sent for durability, crash, validation, and lighting testing with various partners and to early initial customers for feedback.”

They have[ shown their betas to the public](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1377350607518920705?s=20) as well.

**Ohio’s Endorsement of LMC:** 🚀 🚀 🚀

[U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), a Democrat who represents the Youngstown, OH area and is running for the senate currently, didn’t mince words about the (Hindenburg) short-seller report. He called it “‘bull\*\*\*\*. I mean it was just to me, it seemed like a hatchet job for (short-sellers) to make money,” he said. “And look, I mean (Lordstown) is threatening the status quo. And a lot of people are going to bet against them, figuratively and literally. It comes with the territory. You don’t get to the top of the mountain without a bunch of people trying to drag you down.”

[Secretary of State Frank LaRose](https://www.vindy.com/news/local-news/2021/03/ceo-extols-positives-of-lordstown-motors-on-heels-of-critical-report/): “I think what this is, is an opportunity to take a challenging circumstance from just a few years ago and turn it into a truly unique and amazing opportunity for not right here in the Youngstown area — Voltage Valley as we like to call it — but all over Ohio.”

[Ohio Governor Mike Dewine:](https://www.cleveland.com/open/2020/06/gov-mike-dewine-said-he-expects-success-from-lordstown-plant-in-first-normal-press-conference-during-pandemic.html) “Really, this is the future,” DeWine said of the truck and the facility, where he got a private tour. “I think this truck has a great competitive advantage over its competitors.”

[Senator Michael Rulli](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), the Republican state senator from the area, has introduced several bills in Ohio aimed at helping the electric-vehicle industry, said he’s visited the (Lordstown) plant recently. He said he’s seen the company’s robotic assembly line putting together a series of 57 betas. Based on what he’s seen, Rulli said he thinks Lordstown Motors will be producing thousands of Endurance trucks sometime this year or perhaps early next year. “They’re way way way far along,” he said. “Whoever wrote that article (Hindenburg) has never been in that (Lordstown) plant. That is a fact. Anyone who was in that plant would read that article and think it was garbage.”

**I WILL NOW SCREAM IT FOR ALL OF YOU: ALL OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TO $RIDE’S**[ **MASSIVE 6.2 MILLION SQUARE FOOT FACILITY**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/lordstown-motors-races-to-revive-shuttered-ohio-gm-plant.html)**. $RIDE IS LEGIT AND WILL BE PRODUCING ELECTRIC PICK-UP TRUCKS FOR COMMERCIAL FLEET CUSTOMERS IN JUST 4 MONTHS.**

They also [recently announced “Lordstown Week”](https://businessjournaldaily.com/lordstown-motors-stock-climbs-14-on-lordstown-week-announcement/) in mid June for analysts, customers, partners, and investors to attend. This will silence all of the short-sellers, lawsuits, and FUD.

$RIDE has an earnings call tomorrow 5/24 where they will be giving updates on crash testing. If they announce they are still on track for mass production in September, this will be HUGE.

**$RIDE Upcoming Catalysts include:**

* [Earnings call tomorrow 5/24](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-announces-timing-first-quarter-2021-financial) to discuss updates on crash testing and timeline to production.
* [Department of energy Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (ATVM) loan](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759546/000110465921037690/tm2110022d1_ex99-1.htm), which should be announced by the end of Q2 2021 (literally any day now).
* [Release of ERV in conjunction with Camping World](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2021/01/lordstown-motors-to-reveal-electric-commercial-van-this-summer/), which is expected next month, and the[ Camping World CEO has already leaked a sneak peak](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1379433681995984905?s=20) of it.
* Beta production updates and contracts with commercial fleets.

**Summary:**

$MVIS moved from $10 to $27 in just a couple of days, and I believe $RIDE is about to make a similar move from $10 back to $20+ with their earnings call being tomorrow after-hours.

EVs are front and center, and the government is pushing for the adoption of EVs in such a big way that you’d be a fool not to own a piece of the pie.

$RIDE has one of the lowest market caps out of all of the EV plays, and they are the closest to fully automated mass production (this September).

Position: 5 Jan 2023 calls w/ a $40 strike. I’m planning to buy more tomorrow before earnings.

**TL;DR:**

$RIDE stock has incredibly high upside, and I think it’s only a matter of time until it squeezes back up to the $20’s. I have been following the chart for a while now, and I believe institutions are currently loading up before this gets squeezed back up.
