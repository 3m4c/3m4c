Guy claims that GME is bouncing back due to Robinhood lifting the GME restriction. Stock started bouncing back at 10:50 am.

Anyone STILL using RH can confirm that Robinhood lifted the restriction around that period? If so, that definitely confirmed the hypothesis GME is down due to low RH demand(amongst other reasons such as short ladder attack). If you have cash in RH, you need to move all your money into another brokerage now!! There is no guarantee that RH wouldn't pull some BS tactics again in the near future.

As many in the #BANG GANG have always known, $BB becoming a meme stock has been a **mixed** blessing, to say the least. to say the most, it's fucking sucked.

Look at this chart. Look at this fucking chart. I don‚Äôt need to run a regression, let‚Äôs be just as retarded as all the candle-stick reading dipshits with a Bloomberg terminal (*#Ben Graham GANG# FOREVER AND ALWAYS)* \- Look at the lines, and how they‚Äôre moving together. Try to wrinkle that smooth brain of yours for a second.

**Why THE FUCK would an (a) Endpoint / digital security company, a vidya retailer (yeah, sure they sell funko pops too now great ), a movie chain (half of you morons have 3 streaming subscriptions and last I checked you‚Äôre not allowed to watch in your underwear while getting tendie crumbs everywhere @ AMC), and some Fininsh 5(g) provider (I don‚Äôt know a fucking thing about NOK) move in tandem other than just being meme stocks on this fucking board?**

By the way - There's been a ton of great technical analysis posted on the others in $BANG. the short squeeze on GME was real and a once-in-a-lifetime catch and i respect the hell out of it (and am also a sad bagholder of a few shares). It's just that the reasons for liking each of the stocks is different.

For better or worse - There was a post, I can‚Äôt find it but somebody else can, that showed the Robinhood dashboard that basically said the three most commonly held shares in any given account was, you guessed it $BB, $AMC, and $GGME.

As you know, Mark Cuban took a break from his busy calendar of being the least retarded Sharktank (No offense Daymond John, I have a soft spot for FUBU but my wife‚Äôs boyfriend no longer lets me rock it) and touching tips with Luka Doncic to [answer some questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lawubt/hey_everyone_its_mark_cuban_jumping_on_to_do_an/). Somebody asked why $GME was taking a nose dive off of Mt. Everest. Per Cuban -

*Supply and Demand, but in this case it literally could be because the source of demand has been crippled . When RH shut it down, then cut it back, lets put aside why, they cut of the greatest source of demand. They created a RobinHood Dive. No RH buyers, means sellers lower their price to find buyers. And they keep on lowering it till they find buyers. Keep the most natural buyers out of the market and the price keeps on FALLING.*

*Then that drop accelerates because the more the stock falls the more owners who bought on margin get margin calls. When that margin call happens, its brutal. They just take your stock, send you a fuck you note and sell your stock at the market price, no matter how low. They just want to get your cash to pay back the loan.*

So. Two things re: $BB‚Äôs volatility.

# #1 Stopping buys (but allowing sales) tanked $BB, just like it tanked the other meme stocks. The tin foil apes can keep hawking about citadel etc. but the truth is likely that RObinhood is a tech-focused firm with shitty financial controls and even shittier risk management (GUH). Never ascribe to malice what is usually (and always with that shitshow of an excuse of a company) incompetence. Those dumbasses had a liquidity problem and solved it in the worst way possible. I hope their IPO fails and Vlad steps on a lego.

# #2. The current free fall of $GME / $AMC is still dragging $BB down. Why? What happens when people get margin called? Their entire account sells off some or all of a portion to satisfy the account. For those of you more discerning retards you know that the same thing happened to the hedge funds last week.

**It‚Äôs called** [**degrossing**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-30/a-reddit-army-descends-on-hedge-funds-chained-by-risk-models?sref=NJllTNWZ)**,** and is what caused the broader market to perform **inversely** to $BANG.

*BTW - It was really fantastic for me to watch my MSFT calls get fucked because of the morons of this sub. Satya Nadella daddy dicked earnings and the stock (along with the whole fucking market) was down‚Ä¶Live by the retard, die by the retard. But look at the bounceback this this week, when all the hedge funds looked around and said ‚Äì Wait, J. Powell is still printing money like Zimbabwe and stocks only go up.*

***What do you think will happen once things calm down, the stimulus checks hit, and retail investors start looking around again for stocks they might like?***

So now what? Well, I REPEAT, **wrinkle that smooth brain of yours. What does #1 and #2 have to do with the** [actual reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4ehan/blackberry_dd/) **that #BANG GANG likes $BB?**

If you said ‚Äì ""Huh, not much"" then congrats you‚Äôve evolved slightly beyond a retarded monkey playing at a slot machine and shitting out sub-par memes.

**TLDR - $BB WENT DOWN TODAY BECAUSE OF FACTORS SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO ITS STATUS AS A MEME STOCK. $BB $BANG GANG EATs WILD DAILY PRICE SWINGS FOR BREAKFAST. THE BIGGEST LESSON OF GME / AMC IS THAT RETARDS TOGETHER STRONG. ON THE OFF CHANCE THAT ENOUGH RETARDS BELIEVE, IT EVEN HAS A CHANCE TO ROCKET AGAIN IN THE SHORT TERM.**

**TLDR the TLDR - $BB #BANG GANG IS IN FOR THE LONG HAUL. WE‚ÄôRE TERRAFORMING MARS, AND TAKING MATT DAMON WITH US.**

POS ‚Äì balls deep in $BB shares, planning to buy more today

&#x200B;

GME has only about 65 million shares available in the market (free-float), that means, you can trade an unlimited amount with derivatives like CFDs, but there's a real scarcity on the main asset, in this case the stock.

&#x200B;

We are about 6 million users here, this means that, if each user buys 10 stocks of GME, more than the 85% of the free float shares are going to be assigned, and in this case, it's going to create a problem for closing short-selling positions, since the users are going to be determining the final price to buy again the stock in order to close the trade. (Remember, scarcity is the word here.)

&#x200B;

Don't you know what this means? I'm not telling to hoard the market and manipulate the order-book, but do the mental math. WALL STREET BETS WON, we are going to be the ones deciding when this craze is going to end, and this is a victory for retail traders, if we want, we could sweep the market.

Thanks to [a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb6aiq/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_03_2021/glt6vxo?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from /u/Guildish, I was prompted to look into how to prevent my $GME shares from being used by hedge funds for the short ladder attacks we've been seeing these past couple days. Our brokerages are allowed to lend out our shares as long as there are no open orders on them. So, put a daily sell limit order on all of your shares (at a reasonable 3x-4x the price that day) so that they can't be lent out. A website I also found helpful information from:

[https://www.contracts-for-difference.com/borrowing-lending-shares.html](https://www.contracts-for-difference.com/borrowing-lending-shares.html)

Stay strong, buy the dips, and hold, fellow retards!

Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I just like the stock. I am a retard and please do your research.

&#x200B;

Edit: I am not advising anyone. I bought 15 shares at \~$290 last Wednesday, and tomorrow I'm putting my daily sell limit order at $5k lmao. And probably buying more tomorrow!

Edit 2: I‚Äôve noticed my email shows some comments that look like they didn‚Äôt make it through due to new accounts/low karma, but I‚Äôll try to answer the genuine questions through edits. Someone asked what platform I am using, and I use Vanguard. I‚Äôve never had any issues with them, and they don‚Äôt limit how many $GME or $AMC shares I can buy.

Edit 3: Buying stocks with Vanguard is pretty straightforward. If you need help, feel free to PM me. Someone mentioned that the short ladders cause a placement of an artificial ceiling, meaning huge gains can‚Äôt be made. I‚Äôm not an expert by any means whatsoever, but if you look at the 2008 VW squeeze chart, that proves not to be true. Also, someone mentioned TD Ameritrade is limiting the sell limit. Go as high as it will let you, and if you don‚Äôt feel comfortable with that, it‚Äôs okay. If worse comes to worst, get a Vanguard account, buy shares through them, and set your sell limits to the stars.

Edit 4: Do not buy your shares on margin! A few of you have let me know that shares bought with cash accounts cannot be used for short attacks. Not sure if you all can see their comment, but /u/Germanicusss has advised to ‚Äúpay down your margin debt and/or instruct your broker to move the shred into your cash account‚Äù. I need to do more research into that. Another reminder that this is not financial advise and I‚Äôm not an expert.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1.) COVID vaccine rollout has started, and we will be able to attend movies soon. The Biden Administration (sorry for getting political, just pls keep reading) has an ambitious plan (100 million vaccines in 100 days or whatever the fuck) and this pandemic is almost over. I‚Äôd give it until the end of the year.

2.) **Most** [**AMC**](https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-ent-movie-theaters-reopening-0123-2021) **theatres** [**are open**](https://www.amctheatres.com/amc-safe-and-clean#locations) or they are planning to open soon with social distancing and mask measures in place. They will shut down the food services and concessions, but they are coming back.

3.) **Consumers have a sentimental connection to movies. They will come back**. People are starved for the outside world and will come out in massive hordes to watch movies. People will go out and see movies, take their kids, go on dates, etc. Nothing can replicate the experience of a giant screen and surround audio.

4.) This major influx of blue balled movie goers will cause a major boost in 2021. Then we will see a continuation of the year over year growth we have been seeing since 2012.

5.) The AMC business model is working. The revenue has steadily increased since 2012 year over year. [**In 2012, they made $811 million. In 2019, they made $5.47 billion.**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/206959/revenue-of-amc-theatres/) There has been a steady rise. **THEY ARE NOT IN DECLINE.**

6.) I understand they have many loans, but it is something that can be paid off in a few years with the help of their parent company, Wanda Entertainment, and increased profits in 2021.

7.) They will not go bankrupt. WANDA entertainment, a Chinese company owns the plurality share (20%) and will bail them out if it is necessary. They bought for $2.6 billion in 2012, and have seen a ROI, scoring $2.7 billion in 2013, the year immediately after their purchase. AMC is too good of an asset for Wanda to lose them. Also, AMC can take advantage of new stimulus and other government assistance programs.

8.) It‚Äôs extremely cheap right now because everybody is shorting, and there‚Äôs a pandemic. Corona is only temporary. Everybody thought GameStop was going to go under, until we showed them. Remember that.

9.) If there is interest or heightened trading in the stock, AMC can dilute shares and sell them to help finance operations and pay debt, using stock sales as leverage. AMC just did this today, and they can do it again if needed.

10.) AMC will not go bankrupt, not only because of the potential Wanda bailout, but [**they also raised $917 million today. They have enough runway to stay operational the end of the year. ""Bankruptcy is off the table for now.""**](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/01/25/amc-ceo-adam-aron-on-917m-financing.html) (We should be able to return to theatres by then.) A slight majority of this new liquidity comes from issuing new shares, as described in 9. They are also planning to do debt/equity swaps, so those who take out debt can hold shares in the company, and AMC won't get fucked over by high loan payments.

11.) [**AMC is about 70% shorted**](https://www.highshortinterest.com/)**, there is much potential to cause a squeeze**. However, there are still many more reasons to invest in AMC beyond a simple short squeeze.

12.) AMC does very well when it is not pandemic. $5.4 billion in revenue last year, and there will be many movies, as well as many moviegoers that come out after the pandemic. Especially with major franchise movies, which have been delayed. They [have also reached a deal with Universal, which allows Universal to do home releases earlier, but stipulates they must be in theatres for 17 days before that.](https://variety.com/2020/film/news/universal-amc-deal-theaters-pandemic-1234801134/)

13.) AMC is only $12 a share right now... Even if it loses, you‚Äôre only going to lose a bit. Meanwhile, the ceiling is high, and there is much potential. If you want in, do it now while it's cheap. People keep talking about how dumb it is to buy during the pandemic, but this is the point of largest potential. Don't wait for the recovery to buy.

14.) AMC used to trade at $10 before the pandemic. Let‚Äôs keep it at its former glory. AMC deserved a $1bn market cap and they got one. They will probably hit $20 tomorrow (predicting $25 by Feb1, peak in summer with COVID all done.).

15.) Even though the Net income is negative and they lose money, it consistently stays in the hundred thousands range, and it does not lose that much. Any autist on here from GME could pay the difference. [**AMC has also increased gross profits year over year, from 2,004,200 in 2016, to 3,493,200.**](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/amc)

*(The rest of these bullet points are just jokes, so feel free to skip if you want.)*

16.) Without AMC there‚Äôs no place to spend my AMC points, and there better be a place for me to spend those points because I invested my entire life savings into those damn AMC stubs.

17.) Going to the movies was my childhood. We must save my childhood. DO NOT LET AMC DIE. Save AMC.

18.) You can take ur wife and her bf to the movies when this is over.

19.) The AMC food court literally sells tendies. (But we should call AMC tendies popcorns instead.)

TL;DR : AMC has done a great job with fundraising and can survive until the end of the year. Vaccine rollout has started, and recovery is coming soon. People are due to return to movies. About 70% of shares are shorted, so we can potentially trigger a squeeze.

# Pandemic recovery & squeeze combo.

**Buy AMC. Or don‚Äôt. Your choice.**

**If you‚Äôre with us, let's save the movies. I hope you like popcorn. Get on the rocket, because you're going to the moon.**

**If you don‚Äôt, then bye bye, I wish you the best.**

SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*.

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.

DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY.

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the **false expectation** of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. **DON'T BE THAT PERSON.**

Just remember that when DFV was buying $GME at prices as low as $4 per share he wasn't signing up for the 'diamond hands never sell' club and he never got into the play for reasons like smashing hedge funds, curing cancer etc. That stuff has all come about from us and people jumping on the bandwagon.

WSB before this crazy week that has changed the sub forever was all about taking on risk to try and make money fast. DFV has achieved that on a scale we haven't seen before and if he decides to take profits we should support him doing so and not get upset that it may affect the price etc or say he betrayed a cause he never signed up for.

Its quite simple. The HF's overplayed their hand, and they got caught.  So bad in fact, that they are DESPERATE to unwind their positions at any and all costs.

My opinion is that we have not done enough campaigning of our own to educate people about what is going on.  Of course all of WSB is familiar with the blatant manipulation, how about your FB friends? How about Twitter? Stocktwits? Other investing forums? That journalist you went to school with? We all have a voice and we NEED to use it.  

We are being owned in the media, and they are controlling OUR narrative.  All people are hearing is that a bunch of punks on WSB bought a bunch of shitty companies making the stock rise and they are all going to loose their money, cause another financial crash, and kill your 401k.  Is that what we did here? Or did we discovery that some HF's fucked up so badly due their ungodly greed that they themselves risked blowing up the ENTIRE financial institution (again) and are breaking every law conceivable trying to bail themselves out?  

That's the message that all 8 million of us should be spreading right now.  I full expect each and every one of you to write to the SEC about what is happening.  The HF's may have the money, but we have the voice!

4 Steel Stocks Set to Gain on Spurred Up Demand in 2021

Mentioned:	MT RYI SC.HN ZEUS

The steel industry in the United States now seems poised to make a comeback from the COVID-19 led slump during the earlier part of last year. Demand for the metal is gradually returning as manufacturers are springing to action. Notably, increased demand has led to higher steel prices. Per S&P Global Platts, the benchmark price for hot-rolled steel hit a two-year high of $900 per ton in December 2020, as mentioned in a Wall Street Journal article.

Moreover, the American Iron and Steel Institute reported that in the week ending Jan 2, production increased 3.1% from the week ending Dec 26, 2020. Capacity utilization also improved to 80.1% from the previous week‚Äôs capacity utilization of 72.3%. Although weekly productions were down on a year-over-year basis, the uptick in production from the prior holiday-induced week bodes well.

Reflective of the uptick in demand for steel, manufacturing activity has also been expanding in the United States. Per the latest report from the Institute for Supply Management, the purchasing manager‚Äôs index for December was 60.7% compared to 57.5% in November, marking the eighth consecutive month of growth.

Meanwhile, the World Steel Association (‚Äúworldsteel‚Äù) also forecast in a report that global demand for steel will rise 4.1% in 2021 following an estimated slump of 2.4% in 2020. Moreover, worldsteel predicted that demand for steel in the United States should increase 6.6% in 2021 following an estimated drop of 15.8% in 2020.

Separately, global production of light vehicles is expected to rebound in 2021. This rebound will be important because the automotive industry is a major contributor to demand for steel. Notably, IHS Markit estimated global light vehicle production to rebound 14% to 84.3 million units in 2021, following an estimated dip of 17% in 2020, as quoted in a Business Wire article. The article further mentioned that in North America, IHS Markit forecast a production increase of 29% on a year-over-year basis for the remainder of 2021 following a cautious view of the first quarter.

4 Steel Stocks to Buy Now

The outlook for the demand for steel is gradually improving. Steel prices have witnessed an uptick and reflective of the rising demand, manufacturing activity has also continued to expand. Meanwhile, production of light vehicles is also expected to rebound in 2021, a development that bodes well for the steel industry. This makes it a good time to invest in steel stocks that stand to benefit from this improved outlook. We have selected four such stocks that carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

Please read and share if you love this stock,"Yes that is right. There is a float of 46.89 million shares, as of writing this we have 7.3 million subs. If the average WSB sub owned 6 shares we would own the entire float of the stock. The shorts can squirm as much as they want but the only way out would be to buy back at the price that the share holders are willing to sell for. It was reported that OVER HALF of robinhood users had shares of GME last week, that is 6.5 million users with shares. We are getting very close to cornering the market, I think that may have contributed to the shenanigans at the end of the week. Prepare for more incoming this week, but if we hold the shares we hold the power. Power to the players. If you think owning only a few shares doesn't make a difference it does! 6 shares each and we own the whole thing. I love this stock I love you guys. Please share this if you also love this stock.

First ‚Äì Monke Diamond Hands Banana Rocket Rocket Rocket Rocket Moon

**This is not financial advice. This is speculation based on my limited understanding of SEC rules and documents. Sources linked. Please read edits.**

**TLDR**: **My opinion** is that Shorts will continue to drive the price down with ladders and try to break the chain of consecutive days where GME is listed as a threshold security. ~~They need at least 1 non-Failure To Deliver day before EoD Thursday.~~ **If** ~~they~~ **an individual short gets even 1 day without** **~~aggregate~~** **Failure To Deliver then the entire 13 consecutive day count restarts \*for that short.** ~~They~~ **The shorts as a whole need 5 consecutive days without aggregate Failure To Deliver to have GME fully removed as a threshold security. Selling is good for them and bad for diamond hands. Ape strong together. Diamond Hands get the Rocket Ship.** **No idea if achieving 13 consecutive days will force the squeeze or not.**

&#x200B;

**My opinion** is that Shorts don‚Äôt plan to cover their position by Tuesday. They don‚Äôt have to. Instead, they will drive the price down for as many days as possible and attempt to break the chain of consecutive settlement (read: business) days where they fail to deliver. GME has been listed as a **threshold security** (see below) for ~~10~~   \*37 consecutive business days (please check my math. I had to count on my fingers). \*Individual Shorts (not the short collective as a whole) need to break their chain of failure to deliver on that threshold security before it reaches **13 consecutive business days**. ‚ÄúParticipants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out fails to deliver in ‚Äòthreshold securities‚Äô if the fails to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days.‚Äù \[SEC Rule 204\] (link below)

**If diamond handed monke can HOLD strong and reach 13 consecutive days \*of failure to deliver\* as a threshold security, then the shorts** ~~will~~ **(in theory) should have to cover the positions by buying GME shares or equivalent shares of like kind and quantity.** ~~If maths good, that puts Thursday Feb 4th as day #13.~~ **Ape hold strong.**

**\*\*Edit 5: Math not good. Jan 18th was holiday. We are at 37 consecutive days. Edit 3 & 6 at bottom for more details.**

&#x200B;

We've seen confusion, fear, uncertainty, and doubt surrounding what happened Monday Feb 1st. Remember that FUD is one of their greatest weapons against retail investors right now. They want to use it to divide retail and to convince people to sell based on emotion. I‚ÄôM NOT FUCKING SELLING!

**Warning: I am not a financial professional or a financial advisor. I read at a grade-3 level. This is not financial advice.**

\- Read below here if you can or care.

1. Why no squeeze Monday after $320+ close on Friday?

Shorts weren‚Äôt required to cover their positions on Monday. I think that they have T+2 (time of close + 2 business days) to cover their position. If true, this means they have until EoD Tuesday to cover. After that, they will have failed to deliver on the security. That isn‚Äôt good for them, but it isn‚Äôt as bad as it sounds. Failure to deliver is like a steppingstone in the process. After 5 consecutive business days with \*aggregate Failure To Deliver, the stock is listed as a threshold security. NYSE Threshold Securities can be checked here [https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)

It takes 13 consecutive days being listed as a threshold security before the positions must be closed **(If the rules still apply to them)**. \*I believe this is individual short positions that must be closed not all the shorts as a whole.\*

So, instead of covering, shorts spent the day driving the price down to a more favorable position for them. They may have scared away some paper hands along the way too.

2. How does that help the shorts?

Lower price means it costs less to cover and the Shorts have more room to negotiate with other funds. A cheaper darkpool buyout is good for them. If they can lower it enough, covering becomes a non-issue compared to a full on squeeze.

Shorts want to avoid days where GME fails to deliver and they want to create non-Failure To Deliver days to break the chain of consecutive failures to deliver. This is easier for them if the price is lower.

3. So squeeze on Tuesday/Wednesday right?

I don‚Äôt think the squeeze happens Tuesday or Wednesday. I think the shorts are setting up the next part of their plan. I think if the squeeze happens this week, it happens because the shorts reach 13 consecutive days where they fail to deliver. This means diamond hands and limiting the number of cheap shares that shorts can buy after ladder attacks aka diamond hands.

4. We‚Äôve heard this before. So what?

I agree with the idea that adding RC & friends to the board had a positive influence on the stock price. I don‚Äôt think that was the only thing happening when we saw price rise during mid-January. Going back to the idea of 13 consecutive days as a threshold security, we can refer to our NYSE tracker [https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)

~~Starting at the beginning of the year, we see that Jan 4th is the first day GME is marked as a threshold security~~.<- True but it was already listed as a threshold security starting Dec. 8th. It stays listed as a threshold security through Jan 15th. Remember we don‚Äôt count weekends so the count resumes  January 19th (18th was a holiday) ~~January 18th. On the 18th, it falls off the list for the day and comes back on January 19th.~~ ~~Without this single day drop-off, the 13-day countdown would have ended at EoD Wednesday Jan 20th.~~ I believe that the price jump we saw can be partially attributed to the fact that \*some of\* the shorts NEEDED to avoid another Failure To Deliver or they would risk being uncovered. That was pre-spike. Now ~~they~~ some shorts are in a similar position closing in on \*their own\* 13th consecutive day. They will do whatever they can to avoid that 13th consecutive day because that means they will avoid having their record books searched through by someone outside their firm/fund.se

**Threshold Securities**

Def: Threshold Securities are equity securities that have an aggregate fail to deliver position for

¬∑ Five consecutive settlement days at a registered clearing agency; and

¬∑ Totaling 10,000 shares or more; and

¬∑ Equal to at least 0.5% of the issuer‚Äôs total shares outstanding.

If you see any mistakes or if I missed something, let me know. Looking to keep this as accurate and up to date as possible.

See rule 204 ‚ÄúClosing-out Requirements‚Äù

Edit: 'We must hang together or surely we shall all hang separately.' - maybe some smooth brain that has his face on money

&#x200B;

Edit 2: It has been brought to my attention that I didn't count Jan. 18th as a holiday when checking the threshold securities list. Going back to check my work now and will mark any edits that are made. Information will not be removed, but I will do my best to address any mistakes I have made. Thank you for your help.

&#x200B;

Edit 3: Dec. 25th, Jan. 1st, and Jan 18th were all holidays and NYSE was closed. Going back we see Dec. 8th has GME listed as a threshold security. It was correctly pointed out ( u/AlexGu812 ) that this brings us to 37 consecutive days. I don't know enough about this stuff to confidently say what that means. I think it may have to do with the close-out requirements or it could be a sign of bad faith actions.   ""The requirement to close out fail to deliver positions in threshold securities that remain for thirteen consecutive settlement days does not apply to any positions that were established prior to the security becoming a threshold security"" <-- This may explain why we haven't seen mass closeouts despite passing the 13 day threshold.

Sourced from [https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P235\_88503](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P235_88503)  \- relevant section can be located with the find tool and typing ""98"". For me, it is 1 of 18. Clicking the 98 hyperlink will take you to a written example provided by the SEC.

&#x200B;

Edit 4: If you feel this doesn't matter because the SEC won't enforce it then please consider contacting your representatives. Rules and regulations should be enforced. We can't encourage a lack of action just because things are hard or more complicated than we thought they would be.

&#x200B;

Edit 6:  The 37 consecutive days are the shit splatters on an otherwise decent toilet. Let's try to clean it up without automatically assuming foul play. This is a thought exercise, **but I do not know if it holds true in the real world.**

In the post, I refer to ""The Shorts"" as a collective, but that's incorrect to assume. Not all shorts are making the same decisions or acting at the same day/time. We know that Failure to Deliver is measured as an aggregate, which is a net balance. If delivered are (+) and failed are (-) then we can figure out if a security failed to deliver by seeing if the net total is positive or negative (my understanding is that as retail we get the data as it becomes available rather than being able to measure it ourselves in real time). Within that net total, some actors will deliver their shares and some will fail to deliver. **Just because a security fails to deliver on the day doesn't mean every actor has failed to deliver. It just means the aggregate is net negative (for this example).** If this line of thinking is correct, it is possible that no individual actor has failed to deliver a threshold security for 13 consecutive days.

**Again, edit 6 is a thought exercise. Additional input, comments, criticism, and other lines of thinking are welcome.**

Those are 143 (which was unbroken at the tie of writing), 68, and 38. 68 (8:10 - 8:25 AM today, Feb. 4 '21) has clearly broken as people closed off positions at breakeven and the flood gates down burst open. Another sell off between 10:00 & 10:15 AM coincided with another sell wall at 64-62. I think we'll make it all the way to 30-40 before it'll make sense to start buying long again (you saw what happened at 64-68; the same will likely happen at 34-38 but I don't know where the exact floor is).

The data has been showing, since the 140s, that retail isn't holding. ***The data presented as the cornerstone and namesake of this DD is no longer relevant***. The ratio of volume of shares per sell order relative to buy order appears to be higher than the ratio of buy orders to sell orders. In other words, there may be a 3:1 distribution of raw orders, but the sells are so much more packed that it breaks the ratio anyway. *The situation changed and as more data came to light, I now know I was wrong.*

*I used to be a HODLer* ***until the situation changed***. I lost out on a lot of profit by holding through waning evidence at the 300s, 200s, and 150s, and only pulled at 111‚ÄîI was able to secure a little bit of profit to make this obsession a bit more worthwhile. At time of writing, the price is 52.60. Even with bullish conviction, this was still a directionally correct move as I can now buy double as much as I had before.

That being said, I think we're in for more downside, and I will not be buying back until we hit the bottom, wherever that may be. ***I'm still long-term bullish on the company transformation and will re-enter a moderately sized position after the volatility settles down.***

**Here's the original DD so you can see how I had brought up good data, but was directionally incorrect in my sprinkled analysis of it. Learn from this like I did, and you'll be more successful in the future.** Furthermore, I will not stop writing DDs because I think the data here is sound and makes sense. What was wrong was the analysis, which can happen to anyone with this many unknown variables. Future DD will take confirmation bias into account and will have higher probability of being on the money.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Today's most traded retail assets on Fidelity were $AMC & $GME.

And you know what people did? They bought a metric fuckton of shares. Contrary to what some of the Reddit Daily thread sentiment (which may or may not be bot-infested hell at this point) & news outlets claim, retail has seemingly not lost any interest in the stock and possibly prevented it from diving further.

Obligatory disclaimer: Mods, for the love of god please let this through it took a lot to write and I know for a fact it hasn't been discussed sufficiently / didn't get a dedicated post yet. Also, I'm a ü¶ç and am not financial advisor and this isn't financial advice. This is a synthesis of public available information with autistic analysis like sprinkles on a birthday cupcake.

Disclaimer 2: I am extremely long $GME üöÄüåô

**UPDATE**: my stop loss got triggered and I am no longer long $GME until data changes. The information here has not changed, but the impact and its magnitude may have.

With that out of the way, I present to you,

# Exhibit A: Order Distribution

\~***75%*** of all $GME orders on Fidelity *today, on 2/1* were to *buy* the asset, rather than sell it. Each order can have however many shares.

[https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml)

That's just Fidelity. If you're able to check the order distribution on other brokers (like Vanguard or Schwab) please post it below and I'll update this post with your info. Usually this information is displayed on Top Traded Stocks or on the stock page itself under some tab.

There's more:

WeBull is showing a 45/55 distribution on the entire order book. Total Outflow (sells) was quoted at 1099, and total inflow at 996. While this may seem useless at first, consider this: the share price lost ***30***% today, but the order book is split ***45/55***, not ***35/65***. Just 10% of the outflow accounted for the 30% collapse in share price.

# Exhibit B: Volume

[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/)

Today's volume was half of the daily average. *Half of the daily average*. And while the price 30% movement may seem scary at first, trending down on low volume is actually a bullish sign. Courtesy of u/weedcomet:

""[https://finance.zacks.com/importance-price-changes-previous-day-stock-market-2906.html](https://finance.zacks.com/importance-price-changes-previous-day-stock-market-2906.html) 'After a strong-volume upward move, if the market moves sideways in conjunction with lower volume for several days in a row, it is a bullish sign indicating that all overhanging selling pressure has been relieved and any buying could spark a strong price rise.'""

In other words, flat or even *declining* on low volume often precedes üöÄ üöÄ üåù. Literally any form of significant buying can move the price by a very high magnitude.

There's also been studies done on this phenomena, and correlation was established between sideways or negative movement on low volume and a subsequent increase in price. Feel free to research this on your own accord and post your findings below for all of us autists to read.

# Exhibit C: Why Retail Buying May Return Soon

I'm not a financial advisor, and even less so Nostradamus. I don't know when we'll be able to take advantage of this sideways movement to our benefit. What I do know is that that time is approaching. Considering two major events:

1. Transition from Robinhood & other affected brokers to mainstream solutions‚Ä¢ This was likely started en masse on Thursday, before RH transfer restrictions kicked in. It takes 2-5 market days to transfer an account to another broker, and about the same for just slushing cash around. That means, a solid chunk of trades will be able to buy into the market beginning tomorrow and throughout the remaining week.‚Ä¢¬†Many are also in the process of opening up new accounts. These were probably started en masse on Friday, when transfer restrictions prevented people from taking the plunge. A solid chunk of brokers need settlement time for instant deposits.- The instant deposits are capped, meaning whale accounts aren't able to kick in yet. Regular deposits takes 1-2 business days to clear. Beginning tomorrow, we'll start seeing larger retail accounts com online and regain their impact on price delta.
2. Robinhood bottleneck may or may not disappear this week. Robinhood just raised another $2.4 billion on top of their previous round, which is more than enough to clear DTC's collateral requirements. According to their own statements as of late, this was the primary reason why Robinhood restricted asset purchases in the first place. If you're willing to trust them on that, it means that we shall see a resurgence in volume from remaining Robinhood users in the coming days.

# Conclusions

Putting 1+2+3 together we get a potential recipe for another green EoW. Retail sentiment being positive can translate into higher volume once logistical bottlenecks are cleared and resume ass-ripping activities. HOWEVER, it is by NO MEANS guaranteed, and only the tippy top of the world know exactly what these mfs might pull off in the coming days. Get yourselves ready for either a positive or negative scenario this week / beginning of next.

GME to moon.

**ANOTHER EDIT:** Welcome to the end of the post. I‚Äôm proud of you for making it this far in literacy class. I want to respond to all of your comments and questions but automod deletes all but a couple of them. I‚Äôll answer them as soon as they show up.

**UPDATE:** Ok automod deleted a bunch of negative feedback which is WRONG. Also some FAQs that got blocked. The questions were valid so here‚Äôs the best I could do:

1‚ÄìRetail made no dent so what to expect now?

* I don‚Äôt know what to expect. What I do know is that retail made no dent because of the bottlenecks mentioned in Exhibit C above.

2‚ÄìShould I buy now or what?

* I want you to make your own conclusion based on available evidence, not seek confirmation bias. I don‚Äôt want to be liable for your money and neither does anyone else.

3‚ÄìSmart money is leaving and you‚Äôll be left holding the bag

* I have yet to see credible evidence in either the trading volume, SEC reports, or formal announcements from any major institutional shareholder of GameStop that indicates they‚Äôre leaving. If you have this information please relay it to me (don‚Äôt use comments, you‚Äôll get blocked by bot). BlackRock had to adjust due to internal requirements AFAIK correct me if I‚Äôm wrong
* **UPDATE**: this post shows that more instutitional shares flowed out than in. But, more funds bought in than exited. Make of that what you will. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laum38/for\_the\_scared\_little\_baby\_apestake\_a\_look\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laum38/for_the_scared_little_baby_apestake_a_look_for/)

4‚ÄìAMC?

* I have no data on AMC. You should do your own research and make a thread like this.

5‚ÄìWhen selling then?

* I have an emergency exit plan like everyone else should. I don‚Äôt have the financial capability to let GME go to 0. I‚Äôll keep a small position post-exit just in case. Make an exit plan that aligns with what loss or gain you can stomach. Don‚Äôt invest more than you‚Äôre willing to lose. Nothing on this sub is financial advice. You don‚Äôt have to sell if you can lose everything. I‚Äôm probably liquidating my options and doing shares only until further trend confirmation.",DD,0.99

131,DD,lbt8yz,2021-02-03 18:43:33,Bull Case for AMC - DD from a Hollywood Film Producer-Director,"\*Not Financial Advice. Entertainment purposes only.   
I work in the film & tv industry in Hollywood. I was bearish on AMC for 2021 because of the pandemic. Our industry pretty much shut down and our local productions, while still going on, are pricey due to the many restrictions and guidelines set forth by our state. 

But recent events with GME made me take a deep dive into the numbers, and well, AMC actually looks pretty good. I nearly forgot that studios like Paramount, Universal, Disney, etc. are bagholding their slate of tentpole movies (movies with budgets well over 200-million) because it doesn't make any sense to stream them.

**Quick Facts:**  
1) AMC received a fresh infusion of cash through the stonks.   
2) And this was after AMC received loans in the north of 100-million.  
**And here's the banger:**  
3) AMC has 2-years worth of tentpole movies from all the major studios waiting for release. This includes Tenet (projected 1.5-billion), Mulan, Wonder Woman, Top Gun 2, Fast and the Furious, Bond, Pixar's Soul, Space Jam and many many more.  A typical year might have three of these. 

This is bad for the studies because their ""great"" movies now have to compete for market share in a saturated market, but for AMC, it's a great problem to have. It's like having 2 Christmas's in one day. 

**Pent-Up Demand:**  
Box office ticket sales, pre-pandemic, have been around 10-11-billion dollars per year. AMC has the dominant market share and had been generating about 5 to 5.5-billion in revenue (from ticket sales and concessions). 

When Japan re-opened their theaters, Demon Slayer became the number one grossing movie of all time. Pundits believed that the Japanese would've probably watched anything that was released at that point due to pent-up demand. 

If the pent-up demand hypothesis is true, then late 2021 might have the biggest, most profitable quarter ever for AMC, and 2022 will be even bigger. Forward guidance reported in any 2021 quarter's earnings will foster great optimism, and due to secular factors and the fed's push for lower interest rates, we might see some of the best numbers 

**Another possibility:**  
If Japan cancels the Olympics (likely), that opens up another 2-3-month window of time for studios to schedule their releases. For example, instead of Wonder Woman competing for August's 1-billion market share with Pixar's Soul, Soul could release in August, and Wonder Woman could release in October, etc. This means more efficient releases and more dinero for AMC. 

TL;DR - Pent-up demand, likely near-term re-opening due to vaccines, the fact that major film studios are bag-holding tentpole movies and will do whatever it takes to release them to the market when AMC still has the lead market share of theatrical ticket sales makes me MEGA bullish on AMC.",DD,0.91

Why This Weekend Is So Crucial...

Ok listen up retards... I know it's Friday and some of you short-term monkey brains are thinking about bailing on your brothers. Your paper hands are beginning to cramp up. I get it. **BUT WE CANNOT SELL!**  


There are still **MASSIVE** amounts of shorts on $GME. Still well over 113% of total shares floated (*from S3 Partners*). Some old shorts have gotten out, but many **NEW** shorts have taken their place in the past couple of days hoping that $GME will die out.  


# Here is the key part...

They are literally PRAYING for us to sell our shares and end this entire thing today. They are HOPING that they can make back their money at our expense... **BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT THEY HOLD THEIR SHORT POSITIONS IS COSTING THEM BILLIONS OF DOLLARS COLLECTIVELY!!!**  


# BILLIONS A DAY.

All we need to do is **HOLD**. That's it. We will cost them so much money today, next Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and on and on. Soon enough they won't be able to pay the cost of their shorts or it just won't be worth the cost anymore and they will all eventually have to bail. **THAT IS GOING TO BE THE SQUEEZE**. Once the costs keep adding up, they will start to bail and the rest will follow.  


WE MUST STAY STRONG. DON‚ÄôT FORGET WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO US. IT'S A GAME OF CHICKEN. WHOEVER BLINKS FIRST.. LOSES.  
We're not fucking blinking.  


**TL/DR: HOLD. HOLD. HOLD. THIS WEEKEND INTO NEXT WEEK IS CRUCIAL!**

I don‚Äôt typically do posts like this and so this is fucking new to me. Anyways, it seems like a shit ton of you are falling out of favor with NOK. I don‚Äôt know what the fuck is wrong with you if you expected to gain a shit ton of money in a day, but what the fuck I have never seen such üßªü§≤üèª in my fucking life for the past two days. 

Are you guys really just going to stand there and let the enemy beat the fuck out of us. 

And of course some of you are going to mention the total float as if that fucking matters because the stock is still cheap as fuck (for now lol üöÄ) and because we managed to trade one fucking fifth of all the NOK stocks in circulation. They literally had to stop our asses from buying a couple of times. Just like you autistic retards I have lost thousands of dollars in this shit. My paychecks, birthday money, dividends, money from the sale of blue chips and Ark ETFs, etc.

So where‚Äôs the upside? Well let me fucking tell you where the upside is and when you can expect to pull off the biggest fucking heist alongside GME and AMC Wall Street will have ever seen. üî•üöÄüí∏

NOK is well known to be the bigger beast when it comes to the BANG stocks (BB, AMC, NOK, GME). It has a fuck load of shares to go around and there‚Äôs a lot of paperhanded pussies out there, so I understand why it may be daunting to expect a Juggernaut like NOK to moon anytime soon. 

But it doesn‚Äôt have to be. 

NOK releases its earnings on Thursday and its expected to blow the competition out of the fucking water. I wouldn‚Äôt even be surprised at all if it were to get a higher price than ERIC in two weeks (hell, possibly by EOW). NOK even plans to merge with top tier companies in the near future due to their prowess in the 5G tech that they‚Äôre developing. The üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüêª have had their big meaty claws ever since its ATH of $62 all those years ago. Do you really expect a change if you don‚Äôt fucking BUY and fucking HOLD. No, with a team of fucking retarded  superstars in this sub, NOK is prepping for a fierce comeback in the upcoming weeks. GME is top dog right now, but let‚Äôs be honest. GME hype can‚Äôt last forever (even tho it can for a long time as long as we remain retarded). However being on team NOK makes me feel like I‚Äôm on a loosing, shitty ass baseball team and no one is hitting over .100

What‚Äôs the plan, Stan?

The fucking plan is that you don‚Äôt buy market price. You look at the ask price and you fucking buy it. This is how we destroy walls. The $5 barrier battle today was hard fought and we fucking lost to the hedge funds. This next week is going to be fucking spectacular ü™ÑüöÄü§≤üèªüíé and I need to know if my fucking NOKle heads are even in it to win it or just downright frauds. 

You say NOK was a plan by the bots? Take a look at fucking BlackBerry. That shit took the same swerves NOK did that it‚Äôs pretty much identical. If NOK is a sham, then the idea of the BANG stocks is a sham. 

I know for a fucking fact you don‚Äôt believe that. I know that there‚Äôs dreamers in this sub. I dream just like you. I am trying to build a life just like you guys are. We are in something way bigger than ourselves so if you can for ONCE IN YOUR LIFE consider that maybe that the process is a trustable process then maybe we can win this shit.

If NOK hits $50, I will literally buy new fucking silverware (like expensive handmade shit with sterling silver cutlery) and eat my own shit. I don‚Äôt give a fuck whether you‚Äôd want to see it or not, because honestly boys I‚Äôd eat my shit to go to the moon and I am 200% willing to take one for the team. 

This year, BANG is for real.

So hedgefunds, keep your ears out for the NOK NOK sounds on the door. We‚Äôre pissed and we‚Äôre armed to the teeth.

EDIT: General cheese reporting. Post this shit everywhere. I dont give a fuck. I WILL be producing a flank strategy tomorrow. People have to know goddamn it. Monday/Tuesday will close at $7 just give it time

EDIT 2: some of you pussies are asking where you can buy NOK. The easiest way to buy it is with that fucking app all the whores on Tinder beg for food money on: Cashapp. There are literally no fucking limits and if you want an extra 2 fucking shares then use this shit when you sign the fuck up and get $10 extra buckaroos: BKXDNGQ. I also want to make it clear that everyone should share their cash apps so that we can get that $10 extra to put into NOK.

155,GME,l97ykd,2021-01-31 09:10:30,The real reason Wall Street is terrified of the GME situation,"I have been following GME since mid-September and over that time I have banked myself a %1300 return in the process. However, the whole time I was a little puzzled with how severe the reactions from Wall Street have been, especially this week. ""The company had more than 100% of its stock sold short! That's never happened before!"", you say. I know, I know, but that's [not actually not a new thing](https://www.forbes.com/2006/08/25/naked-shorts-global-links-cx_lm_0825naked.html?sh=f59ff078400b). A short squeeze, even one of this magnitude, should have squoze by now with GME up more than 10x in the span of weeks. Something is just not right. **I think there is something much, much bigger going on here. Something big enough to blow up the entire financial system.**

Here is my hypothesis: I think the hedge funds, clearing houses, and DTC executed a coordinated effort to put Game Stop out of business by conspiring to create a gargantuan number of counterfeit shares of GME, possibly 100-200% or more of the shares originally issued by Game Stop. In the process, they may have accidentally created a bomb that could blow up the entire system as we know it and we're seeing their efforts to cover this up unfold now. What is that bomb? **I believe retail investors may hold more than 100% of GME** (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company). This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.

For you to follow this argument, you need to go read the white paper [""Counterfeiting Stock 2.0""](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) so you understand how the hedge funds can create fake stock out of thin air and disguise it so it looks like real shares. They use these fake shares in [short attacks to drive the price of a company down until they put them into bankruptcy](https://seekingalpha-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/instablog/11442671-gerald-klein/3096735-anatomy-of-a-short-attack?amp_js_v=a6&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQHKAFQArABIA%3D%3D). This practice seems to be widespread among hedge funds that go short. There is even a term for it, ""strategic fails‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver."" Counterfeiting shares is extremely illegal (similar level to counterfeiting money) but it's very difficult to prove and even getting the court to approve subpoenas because of the way the financial industry has stacked the deck against investigations.

This completely explains why so many levels of the financial system seem to be actively trying to get in the way of retail investors purchasing more GME. It's not just about a short squeeze, it's about their firms' very existence and their own personal freedom. We have the opportunity to put all these people in jail by proving that we own more than 100% of shares in existence.

There are are **71 million shares** of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via [13F filings](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme) that they own more than **102,000,000 shares** (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen). Now, I don't know the delay/variance on these ownership numbers, but I think there is a pretty solid argument that close to 100% of GME is owned by these firms, if not more.

Moreover, there are now more than 7 million people subscribed to r/wallstreetbets\~\~. I know lots of people here are sitting on a few hundred shares that they bought back when it was under $50. Some of us are even holding thousands. If the average number of shares owned by each subscriber is even close to 5-10, we have a very good shot at also owning a similarly enormous amount of GME.\~\~ **Even if the average was just 10 shares per legit subscriber, that puts the minimum retail position at about 30-50% of the entire company.**

GME has been on the NYSE threshold list for almost a month. We don't have January data yet, but I just analyzed the data from the [SEC's fails‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver list for December](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) (all 65,871 lines of it) and looked up the number of shares that were likely counterfeit. For comparison, I did the same for a couple random tickers. Most companies have close to no shares not show up. Of those that do, it's a relatively small number of shares. For example, two random companies: Lowes ($LOW, \~$125B market cap) had 13,960 shares fail to be delivered at its highest point that month, Boston Beer Company ($SAM, $11.5B market cap) had 295 shares fail to be delivered.

How many shares of GME failed to deliver? **1,787,191.** As the white papers points out, the true number of counterfeit shares can be 20x this number. How bad do you think that number will be when we get the numbers for January? I'm willing to bet its many times that. Look at how that compares to other companies' stock:

[Histogram showing number of shares that weren't delivered in December \(x-axis\) vs the number of companies that fall into that bin \(y-axis\). GME is an extreme outlier.](https://preview.redd.it/g723jvyhine61.png?width=445&format=png&auto=webp&s=39bad6c47b428d364de36e9888de35b79572d1da)

I think this explains all the shenanigans going on the last few days. There is way too much counterfeit GME stock out there and DTC, the clearing houses, and the hedge funds are all in on it. That's why there has been such a coordinated effort to disrupt our ability to buy shares. **No real shares can be found** **and it's about to cause the system to fall apart.**

*TLDR; We probably own way more of GME than we think and that is freaking out Wall Street because it could prove they've been up to some extremely illegal shit and the whole system could implode as a result.*

EDIT 1: You should also note this is the distribution for NASDAQ tickers, not the entire NYSE. I doubt that the distribution trend is any different though.

EDIT 2: Evidence that Fannie May and Freddie Mac were killed in 2008 via short attacks using counterfeit shares: [report](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-407a.pdf). Exactly what I think they were trying to do to GME.

EDIT 3: A lot of people were hung up on the ""3 shares per wsb subscriber thing"". I know many accounts are bots, I was intentionally underestimating that number. I have adjusted to 10 shares per ""legit subscriber"" to reflect this without changing the total amount I think retail owns.

EDIT 4: What I'm seeing on Twitter makes me think I'm being interpreted a little too hyperbolically when I say ""Something big enough to blow up the entire financial system.**"" We're not going to go back to mud huts, people.** This could just be really disruptive for a short amount of time and cause a number of firms to face liquidity problems, possibly bankrupting some of them. Life will go on and I'm confident regulators and government will step in and protect people if necessary. Hopefully they pay more attention to enforcing securities laws going forward to prevent this from happening again.

EDIT 6: I am getting thousands of messages. I won't be able to respond to all of them. Here is an FAQ:

1. *How do I learn investing?*I am not an authority on this, but my personal opinion is to first learn how to read a company's financial documents and value businesses and only then start thinking about putting your money into specific stocks. Read ""the intelligent investor"" by Benjamin Graham for this. Then learn how to think about picking stocks. I like Peter Lynch's books for this.
2. *What is going to happen this week?*I have no idea and I wouldn't dare to guess.
3. *Are you going to be killed?*I don't know where people are getting this idea. I have no special knowledge or insider contacts, and I am in no way, shape, or form an expert on the market or the system behind it. Please treat my tinfoil-hat conspiracy theories as just that. There is nothing to gain from harming me and I have no doubts about my safety. These are just personal opinions and I don't have any schemes to ""take down the shorts"" or anything like that. I do not advocate for you to buy, hold, or sell. I'm just postulating on how we might have found ourselves in this place.",Discussion,0.93

We are already at disadvantage because we do not have a clear picture how much shares WSB actually owns.

There are roughly 28M floating GME shares. If 500k out of 8m WSB subscribers own 56 shares each, it would mean WSB individuals are holding all of the floating. Which would mean shorts couldn‚Äôt have covered a lot past week. 

u/lasagnahog1 already piled up lots of data from recent posts. And he is willing to compile all our shares if we want. I propose that we all send him a DM with screenshots of our shares (nothing else, no name, no account numbers).

This way we can unite together and decentralize the power only wall street has as of now.

Now to the main subject GME is still an undervalued treasure. I know it seems like it might be overvalued because of the euphoria around GME these past two weeks, and how the media (and even some folks on wsb) try to portray it as a bubble, which it isn't.

1. Its a company with around $6 billions in annual revenues, and a new set of innovative leaders (Cohen and friends) who have a track record of turning companies into money printers (Chewy Inc now worth over $44 billion, was first losing money and bringing less than $26 million in revenue).
2. Its growing its E-commerce side by a whooping 254% (25% of all revenue was form online sales last quarter).

Collusion between RH, prime brokers and the DTC can potentially damper the effects of the short squeeze because of loose and unsanctioned SEC rules regarding Regulation SHO that governs short selling, and in this case, [failures-to-deliver](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm).

If you have a margin account, brokerages do not need your permission to lend your exercisable shares if you buy a call or sell a put. This is their way of temporarily creating shares out of thin air, aka counterfit shares. While you wait for expiration date, brokerages keep a tab of all its customers' ""lendable shares"" and sends it to the DTC in this thing called the share borrowing program. The DTC will then lend those to other brokerages whos customers just bought a call option that is essentially a naked call initiated by the seller. Now while this call option remains open, since it's a naked short, the shares get to be lent again into another new naked short in a other brokerage, in **an ever-perpetuating cycle that results in a temporary increase of the number of total shares traded**.

This trick hedge fund use is called Continuous Net Settlement (CNS), and there are many other ways for shortsellers can manipulate the stock price, inclusing Ex-clearing and Fails-to-deliver strategies.

So if you buy a call or sell a put from a margin account, you're essentially allowing the number of total shares to grow artificially which makes the price go down!!!

Plus, these created shares cannot be accounted for, but in most cases, undiscoled short shares typically represent 20 to 50 times the number of failures-to-deliver (which is the only metric the SEC tracks).... that's HUGE!

*Redefining gaming, eSports, and streaming*

Company Overview

Corsair Gaming is an American computer hardware and peripherals company founded in 1994 and headquartered in California.

They acquired Elgato Gaming in 2018 to expand to the streaming gear market, Origin PC and SCUF gaming in 2019 to expand into the custom-built PC systems and console controllers markets, respectively, and during 2020 they acquired Gamer Sensei and EpocCam, and partnered with Pipeline to grow into the gaming and streaming coaching market.

Corsair went public on September 23, 2020, with its IPO priced at $17, valuing the company at about $1.3B.

Understanding the Business

**Value Proposition**

Corsair provides specialized, high-performance gear for gamers and streamers. Their products are designed to provide speed and reliability for competitive gaming, high quality content for streamers, and powerful PC components that allows gamers to run modern games smoothly.

**Revenue Streams**

Currently, Corsair groups its product offering into two segments: gamer and creator peripherals and gaming components and systems.

Gamer and Creator Peripherals:

which represents around 25% of net revenue, includes gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets, streaming gear, and high performance console controllers.

Gaming Components Systems:

which represents around 75% of net revenue includes computer cases, power supply units (PSU), high performance memory products (40% of net revenue), and custom-built gaming systems.

Acquisitions and Partnerships:

During 3Q 2020 Corsair acquired Gamer Sensei, a gaming coaching platform, EpocCam, an app that allows iPhones to serve as a webcam, and partnered with Pipeline, a course-based education platform for streamers.

Industry

**Market Size**

According to Jon Peddie Research, the global gaming and streaming gear markets is expected to reach $40B by the end of 2020. Before the pandemic JPR estimated the market to grow at a modest 1.05% CAGR until 2022. However, during 2020 the market has grown an estimated 10% year-over-year.

Additionally, DFC Intelligence research estimated that the video-game coaching market surpasses $1B.

**Industry Fundamentals**

Growth in the gaming and streaming gear industries are driven by strong and robust fundamentals.

Popularity of gaming is increasing:

According to Newzoo, there are an estimated 2.7B gamers worldwide, which are expected to spend $159B on games in 2020 and is expected to grow at an 8.3% CAGR to exceed $200B by 2023. PC and console gaming represents 51% of the total market, and mobile gaming 49%. Corsair has stated that currently there is no interest in expanding to the mobile gaming market.

Tech-driven improvements in game quality:

Advances in computer power have enabled gaming platforms to provide increasingly immersive experiences. This in turn, places increased demand on high-performance computing hardware.

Increasing gaming and streaming engagement:

Some interesting facts reported in the Limelight Networks‚Äô State of Online Gaming 2019 research report include:

* On average, video gamers spend six hours and 20 minutes each week playing video games
* More than 38% of gamers would like to become professionals if it could support themselves
* Gamers from novice to aspiring professionals report missing daily activities due to gaming, missed sleep is the most pervasive
* Watching gamers play video games online is more popular than watching traditional sports for 18-25 year olds.

**The eSports and streaming flywheel**

The rise in popularity and viewership of eSports brings more investment from publishers, sponsors, advertisers, team owners, and leagues to the eSports industry. Increased investment brings more players and increased performance focus of gamers who advance from less engaged gaming to high-performance gameplay, which in turn brings more viewers.

Competitive Landscape & Risks

**Competition**

The gaming and streaming market is characterized by intense competition, constant price pressure and rapid change. Competition across Corsair‚Äôs product offering includes:

**Gaming keyboards and mice** \- Logitech and Razer

**Headsets and related audio products** \-Logitech, Razer, and HyperX

**Streaming gear** \- Logitech and AVerMedia

**Performance controllers** \- Microsoft and Logitech

**PSUs, cooling solutions, and computer cases** \- Cooler Master, NZXT, EVGA, Seasonic, and Thermaltake

**High performance memory** \- G.Skill, HyperX, and Micron

**Pre-built and custom-built gaming PCs** \- Alienware (Dell), Omen (HP), Asus, Razer, iBuypower and Cyberpower

**Competitive Strategy**

The company follows a differentiation leadership strategy by prioritizing high-performance and professional quality and charging a price premium on their products in exchange for superior quality, high value added features, and superior brand recognition.

**Market Share**

According to NPD Group, by 2020 Corsair had #1 market share position in the US in its gaming components and systems products with 42% of the market share from 26% in 2015. Their gamer and creator peripheral products are not yet market leaders, however, the company increased its market share in that segment from 5% in 2013 to 18% by 2020 in the US.

**Growth Strategy**

Move into the Asia Pacific region:

The Asia Pacific Region represents a long-term growth opportunity. According to Newzoo, they represent 54% of the global gaming community.

Complimentary acquisitions:

Corsair has carried out this strategy aggressively since 2018 with the acquisitions of Elgato Gaming, Origin PC, SCUF and Gamer Sensei. They plan to continue evaluating and pursuing new acquisitions that may strengthen their competitive position.

New Markets:

Uses of streaming gear has spread into areas including, podcasting, video blogging, interactive fitness, remote learning, and work-from-home, which represent a promising avenue for continued expansion in this product segment.

**Threat of New Entrants**

Because of the continued convergence between the computing devices and consumer electronics markets, increased competition from well-established consumer electronics companies is expected in the gaming and streaming peripherals segment (e.g. use of Audio-technica microphones by streamers).

**Threat of Substitution**

A significant medium- to long-term risk for Corsair‚Äôs business model is the evolution of cloud computing and augmented/virtual reality entertainment.

Cloud computing refers to a computing environment in which software is run on third-party servers and accessed by end users over the internet, requiring minimal processing power from the end-user‚Äôs system. Through cloud computing, gamers will be able to access and play sophisticated games without the need of expensive high-performance PC systems and components.

According to Grand View Research, the global cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 48% from 2020 to reach $7.2B by 2027.

Additionally, Corsair must be able to adapt its product offering to meet the needs of the evolving augmented/virtual reality industry.

**Moats**

There does not seem to be any relevant, structural moats, that may prohibit competitors from capturing Corsair‚Äôs market share across their product offering.

**Other Relevant Risks**

Due to the concentration of their production facilities in Taiwan and China, Corsair may be adversely by geopolitical tensions and trade disputes.

**For the 9 months ended September 2020 compared to the same period last year:**

The 49% increase in net revenue is mostly attributed to a large number of consumers gaming and working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The company‚Äôs gross margin is influenced by its product mix for the period, gamer and creator peripherals have a higher gross margin (25-35%) than gaming components and systems (15-25%).

I believe they are going to have very strong 4th quarter 2020 earning results. 2020 had record pc sales,and pc video games has reported record numbers of players. They are in my opinion the leading pc peripherals brand for gamers. Q4 Earnings Include both Black Friday and Christmas Sales

Those are 143 (which was unbroken at the tie of writing), 68, and 38. 68 (8:10 - 8:25 AM today, Feb. 4 '21) has clearly broken as people closed off positions at breakeven and the flood gates down burst open. Another sell off between 10:00 & 10:15 AM coincided with another sell wall at 64-62. I think we'll make it all the way to 30-40 before it'll make sense to start buying long again (you saw what happened at 64-68; the same will likely happen at 34-38 but I don't know where the exact floor is).

The data has been showing, since the 140s, that retail isn't holding. ***The data presented as the cornerstone and namesake of this DD is no longer relevant***. The ratio of volume of shares per sell order relative to buy order appears to be higher than the ratio of buy orders to sell orders. In other words, there may be a 3:1 distribution of raw orders, but the sells are so much more packed that it breaks the ratio anyway. *The situation changed and as more data came to light, I now know I was wrong.*

*I used to be a HODLer* ***until the situation changed***. I lost out on a lot of profit by holding through waning evidence at the 300s, 200s, and 150s, and only pulled at 111‚ÄîI was able to secure a little bit of profit to make this obsession a bit more worthwhile. At time of writing, the price is 52.60. Even with bullish conviction, this was still a directionally correct move as I can now buy double as much as I had before.

That being said, I think we're in for more downside, and I will not be buying back until we hit the bottom, wherever that may be. ***I'm still long-term bullish on the company transformation and will re-enter a moderately sized position after the volatility settles down.***

**Here's the original DD so you can see how I had brought up good data, but was directionally incorrect in my sprinkled analysis of it. Learn from this like I did, and you'll be more successful in the future.** Furthermore, I will not stop writing DDs because I think the data here is sound and makes sense. What was wrong was the analysis, which can happen to anyone with this many unknown variables. Future DD will take confirmation bias into account and will have higher probability of being on the money.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Today's most traded retail assets on Fidelity were $AMC & $GME.

And you know what people did? They bought a metric fuckton of shares. Contrary to what some of the Reddit Daily thread sentiment (which may or may not be bot-infested hell at this point) & news outlets claim, retail has seemingly not lost any interest in the stock and possibly prevented it from diving further.

Obligatory disclaimer: Mods, for the love of god please let this through it took a lot to write and I know for a fact it hasn't been discussed sufficiently / didn't get a dedicated post yet. Also, I'm a ü¶ç and am not financial advisor and this isn't financial advice. This is a synthesis of public available information with autistic analysis like sprinkles on a birthday cupcake.

Disclaimer 2: I am extremely long $GME üöÄüåô

**UPDATE**: my stop loss got triggered and I am no longer long $GME until data changes. The information here has not changed, but the impact and its magnitude may have.

With that out of the way, I present to you,

# Exhibit A: Order Distribution

\~***75%*** of all $GME orders on Fidelity *today, on 2/1* were to *buy* the asset, rather than sell it. Each order can have however many shares.

[https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml)

That's just Fidelity. If you're able to check the order distribution on other brokers (like Vanguard or Schwab) please post it below and I'll update this post with your info. Usually this information is displayed on Top Traded Stocks or on the stock page itself under some tab.

There's more:

WeBull is showing a 45/55 distribution on the entire order book. Total Outflow (sells) was quoted at 1099, and total inflow at 996. While this may seem useless at first, consider this: the share price lost ***30***% today, but the order book is split ***45/55***, not ***35/65***. Just 10% of the outflow accounted for the 30% collapse in share price.

# Exhibit B: Volume

[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/)

Today's volume was half of the daily average. *Half of the daily average*. And while the price 30% movement may seem scary at first, trending down on low volume is actually a bullish sign. Courtesy of u/weedcomet:

""[https://finance.zacks.com/importance-price-changes-previous-day-stock-market-2906.html](https://finance.zacks.com/importance-price-changes-previous-day-stock-market-2906.html) 'After a strong-volume upward move, if the market moves sideways in conjunction with lower volume for several days in a row, it is a bullish sign indicating that all overhanging selling pressure has been relieved and any buying could spark a strong price rise.'""

In other words, flat or even *declining* on low volume often precedes üöÄ üöÄ üåù. Literally any form of significant buying can move the price by a very high magnitude.

There's also been studies done on this phenomena, and correlation was established between sideways or negative movement on low volume and a subsequent increase in price. Feel free to research this on your own accord and post your findings below for all of us autists to read.

# Exhibit C: Why Retail Buying May Return Soon

I'm not a financial advisor, and even less so Nostradamus. I don't know when we'll be able to take advantage of this sideways movement to our benefit. What I do know is that that time is approaching. Considering two major events:

1. Transition from Robinhood & other affected brokers to mainstream solutions‚Ä¢ This was likely started en masse on Thursday, before RH transfer restrictions kicked in. It takes 2-5 market days to transfer an account to another broker, and about the same for just slushing cash around. That means, a solid chunk of trades will be able to buy into the market beginning tomorrow and throughout the remaining week.‚Ä¢¬†Many are also in the process of opening up new accounts. These were probably started en masse on Friday, when transfer restrictions prevented people from taking the plunge. A solid chunk of brokers need settlement time for instant deposits.- The instant deposits are capped, meaning whale accounts aren't able to kick in yet. Regular deposits takes 1-2 business days to clear. Beginning tomorrow, we'll start seeing larger retail accounts com online and regain their impact on price delta.
2. Robinhood bottleneck may or may not disappear this week. Robinhood just raised another $2.4 billion on top of their previous round, which is more than enough to clear DTC's collateral requirements. According to their own statements as of late, this was the primary reason why Robinhood restricted asset purchases in the first place. If you're willing to trust them on that, it means that we shall see a resurgence in volume from remaining Robinhood users in the coming days.

# Conclusions

Putting 1+2+3 together we get a potential recipe for another green EoW. Retail sentiment being positive can translate into higher volume once logistical bottlenecks are cleared and resume ass-ripping activities. HOWEVER, it is by NO MEANS guaranteed, and only the tippy top of the world know exactly what these mfs might pull off in the coming days. Get yourselves ready for either a positive or negative scenario this week / beginning of next.

GME to moon.

**ANOTHER EDIT:** Welcome to the end of the post. I‚Äôm proud of you for making it this far in literacy class. I want to respond to all of your comments and questions but automod deletes all but a couple of them. I‚Äôll answer them as soon as they show up.

**UPDATE:** Ok automod deleted a bunch of negative feedback which is WRONG. Also some FAQs that got blocked. The questions were valid so here‚Äôs the best I could do:

1‚ÄìRetail made no dent so what to expect now?

* I don‚Äôt know what to expect. What I do know is that retail made no dent because of the bottlenecks mentioned in Exhibit C above.

2‚ÄìShould I buy now or what?

* I want you to make your own conclusion based on available evidence, not seek confirmation bias. I don‚Äôt want to be liable for your money and neither does anyone else.

3‚ÄìSmart money is leaving and you‚Äôll be left holding the bag

* I have yet to see credible evidence in either the trading volume, SEC reports, or formal announcements from any major institutional shareholder of GameStop that indicates they‚Äôre leaving. If you have this information please relay it to me (don‚Äôt use comments, you‚Äôll get blocked by bot). BlackRock had to adjust due to internal requirements AFAIK correct me if I‚Äôm wrong
* **UPDATE**: this post shows that more instutitional shares flowed out than in. But, more funds bought in than exited. Make of that what you will.

4‚ÄìAMC?

* I have no data on AMC. You should do your own research and make a thread like this.

5‚ÄìWhen selling then?

* I have an emergency exit plan like everyone else should. I don‚Äôt have the financial capability to let GME go to 0. I‚Äôll keep a small position post-exit just in case. Make an exit plan that aligns with what loss or gain you can stomach. Don‚Äôt invest more than you‚Äôre willing to lose. Nothing on this sub is financial advice. You don‚Äôt have to sell if you can lose everything. I‚Äôm probably liquidating my options and doing shares only until further trend confirmation.",DD,0.99

As a long on Nokia, I have been lurking this sub and I see a lot of the same misconceptions about Nokia and well, I believe its time for me to bring some clarity to the reality that is $NOK

**Myth #1 Nokia is a phone company.**

This is wrong, Nokia is not a phone company. They sold their phone business to Microsoft back in 2013 for over 7 billion dollars, later it was sold by Microsoft to HMD for 350 million dollars in 2016, who currently makes the phones. Nokia just gets royalties for the use of their name.

**Myth #2 Nokia has been under the same failed management for 25 years.**

Correction, Nokia hired on a new CEO Pekka Lundmark in August of 2020 and took full leadership in September. He previously worked for Nokia between 1990 and 2000, when he helped oversee the company‚Äôs emergence as the world‚Äôs biggest mobile phone manufacturer and a significant player in mobile infrastructure.

**Myth #4 Nokia is losing market share due to competition**

While yes, there is strong competition in the 5G market, Huawei the global leader, is facing bans across the United States and Europe, ZTE who makes up a small fraction of the market share is also seeing geopolitical pressure. Current estimates of market share show the following Huawei 28.5% Ericsson 26.5% Nokia 22% Samsung 8.5% ZTE 5% and others 9.5%.

Here is an updated list on each countries stance on Huawei and ZTE. The list is growing as more and more countries decide to venture away from Chinese telecommunication equipment.

[https://www.channele2e.com/business/enterprise/huawei-banned-in-which-countries/](https://www.channele2e.com/business/enterprise/huawei-banned-in-which-countries/)

With more countries joining on the list, there is an increase demand on the others within the market to pick up the lost market share.

**Myth #5 Nokia isn‚Äôt a cyber security company like BlackBerry**

Nokia actually is involved in the cyber security field in many important ways. Nokia Smart Grid for example, is designed specifically for one of our largest threats faced by modern nations, Power Utilities.

Nokia Cuts Jobs in France

Staying in Europe, Nokia said it was cutting 1,233 jobs in France, largely impacting research and development positions at its Alcatel-Lucent subsidiary.

Nokia has been slashing jobs amid a global cost savings program originally announced in late 2018. ‚ÄúNokia is reinforcing its efforts and has earlier launched a global evaluation of its \[research and development\] operation that has led to significant adjustments globally,‚Äù a company spokesperson said in a statement.

The Finnish vendor, which is trying to cut $556 million in costs by the end of 2020, announced plans to cut about 180 jobs in its home country at the beginning of the year and hinted at more to come.

PLTRüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

The wsb twitter and the shittron research fiasco has not helped us: they help the media portray us as one voice and as an institution, when in reality we are many voices that are just looking to make some tendies. As you can see by my conversation with my dad, the public sees r/wallstreetbets as an institution. We need to stop any more acts like these that will cause us to get more publicity: this could get the SEC involved and have our community taken down and investigated for market manipulation. As u/Engine3er said, ""We don't need SEC to do us what your wife's boyfriend does to your wife.""

GMEüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

I do not want to see this community taken down: I have been here for a while now, and now primarily use reddit just for this sub. This sub is the only sub that I view(the other word is a banned ticker symbol) by new - although that may have to change since it is becoming filled with so much garbage and low effort posts from new members. You guys have become like a family to me. So we need to stop all this stupid shit and go back to just being a couple of autists trying to reach the moon.

PLTRüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Because of the influx of new people thanks to our publicity we need more mods. There are almost 2 million retards in this sub, and most of those retards are newly discovered. Despite the size of this sub, there are only 19 mods? We need more mods so I can view by new without having to scroll through a bunch of shitty posts that contribute nothing to this sub until I find a well-thought-out dd or meme. I would love to be a mod, but I've never done that before and have no idea how to even apply.

Sorry for the big ass blocks of texts and poor formatting, it must have hurt your smooth brains.  
These are just my thoughts regarding the quandary surrounding r/wallstreetbets, but I'm just a 15 year old autist who has only two stocks in his portfolio. Please address any mistakes I made in the comments, I was kinda ranting about this and didn't do any proper research other than listening to what my wife's boyfriend had to say about this. Please comment your thoughts on this so the fucktards who go straight to the comments know what's going on.

(**Sources in comments**)

Longer version

My investment strategy is finding a stock that will perform well in medium/long term. I usually try to take profits or cut losses within one year, so look for companies that should benefit from what is happening around the world (be it Covid, green revolution, retail industry tendencies). Today I‚Äôll share my opinion about future of deliveries.

For quite a while there has been a buzz around drone deliveries. Be it Amazon Prime Air, UPS Flight Forward, DHL Parcelcopter (my favorite because of this ridiculous name), Boeing‚Äôs Matternet‚Ä¶ Everyone with the capacity to is trying to jump on this ship. You can read more about latest developments and companies working in Source 1.

Why there‚Äôs such race to develop unmanned cargo air vehicles and autonomous flight technology you might ask? Well, drone doesn‚Äôt get sick, can workday and night, it doesn‚Äôt have to take breaks or spend half of it‚Äôs time chatting around or staring at its phone. It also doesn‚Äôt need any contributions to its pension fund or healthcare insurance (needs insurance nevertheless, but technical insurances should come at much better rate than insuring a ball of flesh against all that world could throw at it). Finally, drones don‚Äôt care if there‚Äôs pandemic raging outside or boogaloo boys are stepping on the grass around some government building.

Drone comes off for the buyer as a one-time purchase cost, thus saving loads of cash in the lung run. Many businesses are taking more ‚Äògreen‚Äô approach to their business and calculate their CO2 footprint. Given that drones are powered by electricity (all the attention to the renewable energy, wink wink) it would also help business to boast about reducing carbon footprint while improving their efficiency.

One might think of one issue here: drones are cool and stuff, but what about the battery - it might not be able to cover required distance? Worry not, there are already solutions for this. Mainly ultra-fast charging stations (charge time: 5 minutes) or wireless charging hotspots (charge time: 6 minutes). Check out Source 2 and Source 3.

All in all I believe that drones have a bright future ahead of them and $*TAKOF* is one of the players in this industry.

**Company**: Founded in 2014, Drone Delivery Canada has developed a proprietary and patented turnkey drone delivery solution. The company is fully commercialized, operational, and revenue generating.

DDC has developed a drone delivery platform solution which is cost effective, highly scalable and can provide next generation logistic services to various market sectors including: retail, ecommerce, parcel & post, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, mining, oil & gas, logistics companies, Indigenous Communities, military and government agencies, in Canada and internationally. The Company‚Äôs patented, fully integrated hardware/software platform is used as a managed service in a SaaS business model. Drone Delivery Canada is fully commercialized, operational and revenue-generating, with a robust sales funnel of global prospects. [https://dronedeliverycanada.com](https://dronedeliverycanada.com/)

So far, the company has signed test flight agreements with several major corporations. A medical facility in Ontario, two remote First Nations communities in the same province, GlobalMedic, and Air Canada have all agreed to test the company‚Äôs drones. Last year, it also struck a partnership with European logistics/transport group DSV Panalpina A/S.

**Latest Catalysts**: Drone Delivery Canada plans to integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) into its disruptive drone delivery solution (Source 4); Drone Delivery Canada has been named to the 2021 OTCQX¬Æ Best 50 (Source 5); In January 2021, the FAA added new rules to 14 CFR Part 107 to permit the expansion of routine flights and created four categories of UAS for flights over suburban/urban areas (Source 6)

**Upcoming Catalysts**: release of Q4 and 2020 results; in July company started process to entering US market ‚Äì at some point there will be announcement if this is a success.

**Industry Catalyst**: establishment of a legal basis for unmanned cargo air vehicles, battery technology and wireless charging developments.

Research by Goldman Sachs suggests the market potential could be as big as US$100 billion (CA$130 billion). Meanwhile, startups in the sector are nearly all worth less than $1 billion today (source 7 ‚Äì claims $*TAKOF* has multi-bagger also discusses $*TAKOF* cash position).

[Source 8](https://preview.redd.it/at9xb9uf6cf61.jpg?width=945&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ebb0a0b32b6dba11ac4e1c7ccfd7060ef2ff95c5)

**Summary**: $*TAKOF* is ready for a take off! It‚Äôs literally in their name. 3 rockets.

What a week in steel with some **BIG MOVES.**

Then came this morning. . .people panicked and paper hands sold.

As I said this morning, be patient and hold - it had gotten too hot too fast and we were due for a cool off, however I said - **THIS IS YOUR BUYING OPPORTUNITY!**

**BUY THE DIP!**

**THE TREND IS YOUR FRIEND!**

$CMC was downgraded today to HOLD by Deutsche and then it dumped.

I disagree with their opinion - HIGHLY DISAGREE.

They then upgrade $X and it moons.

Upgrades are great, but you have to take downgrades with a grain of salt, especially by a bank that is upgrading a competing US steel stock on the same day. . .what are they holding?  What do they want to buy?

It smells a little suspect, but that's why you do your own research.

Anyhow, on to the real news of the day that reversed the market and that was Biden's press conference and he laid out that he would be announcing his economic package next week.

 ""Biden is also likely to push for a larger legislative effort later in 2021 after the initial stimulus package. **That effort is expected to focus on spending trillions of dollars on infrastructure** and clean-energy jobs.""

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/01/08/biden-stimulus-plan/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/01/08/biden-stimulus-plan/)

The market instantly reversed and steel started recovering, quickly and by the AH action, I believe we are **PRIMED FOR A BIG WEEK COME MONDAY.**

What really stood out to me today was this as well:

[https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news/2175282-arcelormittal-hikes-eu-steel-coil-prices-again](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news/2175282-arcelormittal-hikes-eu-steel-coil-prices-again)

Everyone that has read my posts know **$MT is my favorite play.**

The doubters in the beginning (and still - I do get your DM's - lots of angry people out there!) said this was a pump and dump.

$MT popped and then went sideways for a week or so - I said to wait and be patient.

That patience has started to come to fruition.

These increases are immediate and will be taken and like Oliver Twist - customers will say, ""please sir, I want some more""

$MT: ""More?!?!?""

$MT: No problem, it's another $50/ton""

Customer: ""Please sir, I want some more""

$MT: ""More?!?!""

$MT: Sure another $100/ton and it will ship in June, oh and by the way, you'll have to pay extra by then because your price is now the price we agreed upon and adders, so PRICE TIME OF SHIPMENT.

By the way, that is becoming common-place in the steel industry today.

This is becoming common-place and this is how steelmakers ENSURE their margins in markets where raw materials are running faster than they can buy them.

This is part of my thesis as to why these companies are going to show INCREASED REVENUE and most importantly - **INCREASED PROFITS.**

Also, those that believe in what's coming and understand the value and dynamics in the market made some shrewd moves and **BOUGHT THE DIP!**

36mil in volume is not a lot! These guys shorted around $5 so unless the stock hits $5 you're fine. Even then, you're fine if we don't sell. Don't be paper handed. Most retailers are still holding.

This is a once in a lifetime chance. Red is just a color, it will change if you hold and buy the dip. I plan on buying more near end of day myself!

**The short itself will probably happen after Thursday Feb. 4th.** This is because that would be the 13th consecutive day of Failure to Deliver on a threshold security. But this only happens if the shorts can't deliver the shares they owe. They're trying to illegally drive the price down so when they buy back they can avoid a squeeze. I'm a literal retard, but I have a feeling the price is gonna start going back up on Thursday or next week. Maybe someone can explain more

**Retail investors own over 100% of the actual shares. This means the price goes as high as we want it to go. It will keep climbing until we sell. They are using every trick in the book because they know they're f*cked! This is literally free money if we all hold. There is nothing they can do but try to scare you.**

I sold my meager 40 shares like a paper handed bitch a few days ago, but have seen the error of my ways and I've been buying back in. I'm going to buy over 40 shares this time to make up for it. HOOOOOLD.

Lastly, remember to remove your stop losses so you don't sell!

First off, to all of you diamond handing this stock, god damn I love you apes.

Now listen up and listen closely. GME is still on a moon mission and its launch is imminent. I've seen some fantastic DD here that is far beyond my analytical skills and I thank you all for that because god knows I can't read so the charts help.

This break down is going to be consist of something we tend to lack here, and that my friends, is logic.

So lets get into it. 

This past week has seen GME hit an ATH followed by a steep decline due to market manipulation tactics and the media turning against us at presumably the hand of the hedge funds we stand to hurt the most. We have seen hit pieces on GME, misdirection, and blatant lies regarding the analytics and reporting of statistics on GME. Countless media outlets have claimed that GME has squeezed already and its over! Its done! Move on and move back in with your wife's boyfriend!

But they are wrong.

Think of this from a surface level and look at the big picture. This entire week was a setup for shorts to mitigate their losses which they knew they would incur regardless. First, we saw a price spike that opened up options far, far OTM.  Out to 800 fucking dollar calls. Then, we saw a steep decline in price along with a fundraiser for shorts in the form of SLV being pushed by shills. Following this we saw massive purchases of these OTM 800c yesterday once premiums and IV were reduced. So what does this mean? Hedges set themselves up to mitigate how much they'll lose in hopes of just avoiding bankruptcy while giving their associates a chance to profit even greater on the impending squeeze. 

Now why would it come this week if a lot of the calls are dated out to March you ask? Apparently, and I don't know this for fact, but Fintel will update GME's short interest officially as of next Tuesday, February 9th. If this is true, and short interest is still over 100%, this will confirm that media outlets were bought and paid for by hedges along with their misdirection, thus causing even further public outrage, and another mass buying of GME to get in on the squeeze that is still coming. 

However, if hedges knock the price down as far as possible and trigger the squeeze this week, they will have effectively hedged their bets with calls, shaken out as many paper hands as possible, and stopped delaying the inevitable, all while leaving the media outlets they paid off, now holding the metaphorical bag of lost public trust, all while mitigating their losses to the fullest extent. 

Essentially, if the short interest is still outstanding and above 100%, shorts would fuck themselves even further by allowing an official report of this to come out and they know it. 

We go the moon soon my fellow apes. Good luck and God speed. See you at 10,000.

This is NOT financial advice and I AM and APE.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Hedges have mitigated their losses and have screwed buyers and the media outlets they've bought. When official short interest reports come out, they'll be outed as liars and the retail retaliation will send us even further to the moon than if they just let it happen prior to these reports.",DD,0.94

275,GME,kyoixl,2021-01-16 19:39:00,"GME - Option, Margin and Other Factors for Trading Next Week","**TLDR:** GME likely to be very volatile next week around $30, $35, $39-$40 especially. 39/40 pass would force about 5m shares of net-buying by MMs, while passing through 30 is about 4.5m shares of additional selling. 36/37 and 31/32/33/34 are more stable.  If price shoots up into the mid 50s  üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ , definitely duck for cover Friday.  Margin changes are actually bearish. Consider being on a brokerage that pays to loan your shares to shorts if long, because it's very profitable. Shorts can be squeezed, but so too can longs who use call options, and shorts who use put options.

Important note: The massive melt-up we had this week was a GAMMA SQUEEZE. Options market makers had to buy about 30m shares (or cover short shares, thanks Melvin Capital, then buy) while going on that run from 20 to 40 to hedge their positions. That as you know is more than half the float. My belief is that gamma effects will continue to be a big deal - but less of a big deal than last week because we have less options near the money now.  **Ironically, Melvin Capital made this melt-up far stronger, contributing 5m shares of forced buying in a rapid spike at $24/$25.**

**Details:**

I‚Äôve seen a lot of discussions about GME over the past week that are missing important bull and bear elements in the thesis. This sub is so incredibly bullish  üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ  that unsurprisingly, there‚Äôs more missing bear arguments than bull, and bearish information is sometimes perceived as bullish (such as the margin requirement increases, which I feel are net-bearish). But there's also missing bull information, namely that more new gamma ramps exist high than low it appears, and they appear pretty large.

I previously posted about some option dynamics last week, that seem to have played out to an extent. I actually lost money on my puts because the expressed vol was less than I thought, and Friday ended up playing out in a basically neutral way from a bull/bear perspective with a mere 10% drawdown. That post is here. I correct predicted the outcome, but didn‚Äôt predict the magnitude well enough and thus my trade sucked:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxb7dy/analysis\_of\_massive\_potential\_gme\_forced\_selling/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxb7dy/analysis_of_massive_potential_gme_forced_selling/)

In this new post, I‚Äôll cover what I know about current option structure (and will update once updated data for Friday comes out), and the implications (TLDR: Mostly, expect vol around multiples of 5 in stock price), as well as other trading dynamic topics that I think are misunderstood or rarely spoken of.

I‚Äôm not going to talk about my opinion of the value of the stock or the turn-around plan. I‚Äôm actually in what is a modest put position for me at the moment (jan 22 $38 puts x 80), but I fully acknowledge this could go to the moon  üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ  next week and I'll feel like a miniature Melvin capital (though shorting at $38 is a lot smarter than at $17) and probably deserve it in that case.

**Current Option Structure:**

I will update this as new data gets in, but you can see big concentrations of options at 30, 35, 39/40 and 45. There isn‚Äôt open interest data for Friday, but volume suggests there are further ramps at 50/55/60, but they are probably smaller than the 39/40 and 30 ramps. Normally, dealers are going to be long calls (from people selling covered calls) and short puts (From people buying protection). On GME I think we all know it‚Äôs short calls and short puts, since people are buying tons of calls from them, and also speculating with puts. As such, dealers are extremely short gamma, and that means that prices accelerate from dealer activity greatly. When the stock sells, the dealers have to dump stock (or short it). When the stock goes up, dealers have to buy.  **I believe that the Wednesday melt-up was as much a short squeeze as a gamma squeeze, as the price moved over a bunch of OTM options, forcing dealers to buy as much as a bit more than 1/2 of the total float of the company to hedge! Further evidence of this is that the stock went parabolic but then stopped being parabolic once past the peak option strike available on Wednesday - $40. Without the dealer lift, the rally slowed a lot.** This is why I think it looks as much like gamma squeeze as short squeeze. It‚Äôs also why gamma positions this week are important, but they are smaller than what was available going from 20 to 40.

These patterns are most sharp at these large concentrations of strike prices, so the stock can jump from 39 to 41 a lot easier than from 36 to 38 as an example. On average, it‚Äôs about $1m of stock bought/sold by dealers per percent change. To put in context, there was a jump Friday where about 250k shares got bought and moved the price 5%. That means that if accurate, dealer activity might have been up to half in that flash.   **We don‚Äôt yet have the Friday data, but there was a lot of Friday volume. This amplification may be greater next week. This week had a gamma event on Wednesday, after which there were a ton of ITM WSB calls and OOM Melvin puts that don‚Äôt have gamma, and thus the price de-volatilized somewhat. But we may now be in a situation with a lot of near the money options, which means we could see very large gamma squeezes up or down again.**

Here‚Äôs the structure, I‚Äôll update once there is Friday OI data available. This chart assumes that calls are positive gamma ‚Äì they will all be negative gamma in this case, so predict accordingly.

[https://imgur.com/a/czrKy6X](https://imgur.com/a/czrKy6X)

Also worth mentioning is the expirations next week. Here‚Äôs the current structure for next week, using Thursday data, which I‚Äôll update once I get Friday data:

[https://imgur.com/a/4wKTspB](https://imgur.com/a/4wKTspB)

This is a lot less bearish than the Friday we just had, but again, I‚Äôll update once I get the data. It‚Äôs still a net sell on Friday as those option positions get cleared out (people sell to realize, and then buy other things in general), but more like under 1/10th of float vs the 1/3 of float we were staring at this Friday. Unless people piled into ITM calls Friday, which I find highly unlikely. As such, the downwards force this coming Friday, if this Friday was -10%, is more like -2 or -3% in a vacuum.  However, the higher the prices go into Friday, the more selling this in turn causes Friday, so in a world where we end at $55 on Thursday, I'd definitely not go into Friday long as this forced selling increases.

My sense out of all of this is:

\- The current gamma structure provides more ramps up than down from $35, but there are strong ramps in either direction. BUT, the volume suggests a lot of new put positions were established. On net ‚Äì volatility up, not bearish or bullish. You could maybe argue very slightly bullish I guess.

\- There is some forced selling this coming Friday, but if that was the driving force yesterday, it would be a -3% or -2% not a -10%.  Slightly bearish. Can change based on price.

\- If the stock moons this week, I would encourage you to approach Friday with care, and a more bearish or defensive mentality, even if fundamentally bullish. Similarly, if we are in the 20s, there are situations where friday eventually becomes forced buying from a ton of short term puts printing, and a bear would not want to be short into Friday.

\- A LOT of capital went into OOM puts and calls this week targeting the week after. If the stock is not volatile, a lot of speculators bleed out on both sides. And those numbers may update my assessments above one way or another.

**Margin Changes**

There was a lot of talk about how various brokerages have increased margin requirements on GME stock. Some set to 100% (Schwab), others set up a bit (TDA from 70% to 75%),  others rumored to be planning but haven‚Äôt (IBKR). The reaction of the sub is that this is bullish. It‚Äôs actually bearish, albeit slightly.

The reason is that most of the shorts, in my opinion, are institutional. Retail will typically short with OOM puts which don‚Äôt cause much actual selling to hedge. Institutions short GME are going to have that in a giant account with a ton of other assets, so changes on margin placed on them, if indeed that happened, wont margin call them except in scenarios where GME goes up 20x in a day or something.

On the other hand, if you are a retail trader where half or all of your positions are GME, this margin change does effect you, especially if you were out on margin, and it makes it harder to buy more shares. I don‚Äôt think many retail traders are directly short the stock.  Anyone want to raise their hand and admit they are 50%+ GME and on margin to do it?

Also, consider the context -retail brokerages just did this on the back of everyone here buying shares long. That to me suggests they are looking at customer accounts, seeing some over-extension, worrying about it, and setting the rule to prevent themselves being burned. Some of you have a net worth of mostly GME in your levered account. If that gets squeezed down and a liquidation is forced those brokerages won‚Äôt be seeing the money.

So, I think the margin changes are a bit bearish, but not hugely so. I would also urge you bulls to not set yourself up to be squeezed, which is my next point.

**Squeezes and Short Interest**

It‚Äôs true that this stock has high short interest. There‚Äôs contradictory evidence as to if the shorts went up this week or went down. IBKR share availability suggests it may have went down, other sources suggest up, and I'll update once we have solid post-Friday data that someone posts. However, just because the short interest is high, doesn‚Äôt mean that it can be squeezed easily from here ‚Äì Wednesday I think was that squeeze. A lot of the old shorts may have covered then, and we may be looking at new shorts. It‚Äôs also possible that these institutional shorts hedged with previously deep oom call options and ironically further helped create the melt up, but didn‚Äôt take losses after a certain point. It is worth noting though that MMs engaging in 30m shares of buying (Some of which was short covering) only doubled the stock - and they are now long stock and will loan it out to short sellers all day.

Additionally, while GME longs here on stock are not squeezable if not on margin, those of you on OOM call options ARE squeezable, and those of you on ITM options are in a sense even more squeezable. OOM call options decay if the stock doesn‚Äôt go up, and then the shares dealers bought to hedge the call they sold you get sold back into the pool. ITM options, when sold, do the same but more powerfully ‚Äì selling a very ITM call option on GME means a dealer immediately goes out and dumps 100 shares of GME on the market. If you in turn buy 100 shares, it‚Äôs netural, or if you buy a bunch of NTM calls, you might even cause a net buy. But, those will tend to cause selling if people take money off the table and as time goes on.

And yes, there are a TON of new put options, and those get squeezed out too.

So there is a dual squeeze potential here ‚Äì shorts vs their losses and borrow fees and decaying option positions which cause dealer buying, and longs using margin and longs in call options fighting time and also watching dealers dump their hedged longs.

One other thing -  contrary to what I sometimes read, Melvin Capital was already squeezed, or rather, their dealer was by proxy.  Wednesday was that squeeze. They bought a bunch of ITM put options which forced dealers to sell a ton of stock to hedge. When the price shot up, dealers bought into that short they made to hedge the Melvin puts, and now the Melvin puts expired worthless. Melvin can not be squeezed further unless they enter a new short position of some type. They lost 55M on that trade, and they manage 20 billion. They may be back in it at this point, shorting this even harder is within their power...

Lastly, it has been brought up that some of the GME short, especially those puts lurking at $2 and $1, are hedges by bond holders against bankruptcy, or are hedges by those who sold CDS to bond holders to hedge their short CDS. Those are going to keep accumulating because bankruptcy is possible (though unlikely) in the few year range, and getting those puts now is basically free. But they won't affect the price since they are so far OOM.

**Uptick Rule**

Because the stock was down a lot Friday the uptick rule was triggered until eod Tuesday. That means shorts can‚Äôt sell at the bid to force down price they can only sell at the ask. In practice this won‚Äôt matter a ton since you can still buy puts to make a dealer do this, and my understanding is they aren‚Äôt subject to that rule anyway. EDIT - dealers do have to obey this but appear to be net long the stock currently so would not be affected. I thus feel this is very slightly bullish.

**Yield Enhancement Program**

A pro tip I have for this sub is ‚Äì if you intend to hold a ton of long stock that is in high demand by short sellers, you should get paid to lend it to short sellers. That‚Äôs how the option dealers make a lot of their money ‚Äì I‚Äôm sure citadel is making a killing holding a ton of GME stock to hedge, and promptly lending it to hedge funds at 30% borrow rate, while having very little risk.

Many brokerages don‚Äôt pay you for lending your shares out, but IBKR does. Right now, if your GME shares are loaned out, you get something like 15% annualized in rebates. WeBull, Fidelity and Schwaab also will do this, but I've not used their programs, and you probably have to ask them to sign up. This doesn‚Äôt work if the shares are in margin, they have be fully paid and settled, but it is a substantial extra if you are a long-term believer in the stock, and on other brokerages, they get paid instead of you.  If any other brokerages have this feature that are non-institutional, please post and I‚Äôll add.

It is worth saying that you reduce the cost to short if you do this. I always allow it on my account though because I like the money more and think I‚Äôll beat the shorts eventually anyway. Some money managers never do it so as to not fuel the shorts. But it does pay.

**A Few Other Thoughts on Shorts**

Institutions do sometimes hedge large short positions. It is possible that some of the calls held on Wednesday that caused the giant explosion up were hedges for short positions held by hedge funds/family offices and others.  The fact we didn't see a lot of selling Friday suggests that at least the near the money ones were mostly NOT held as hedges, otherwise they would've been more monetized. But, it's possible that the short pain is less than thought. We just don't know.

**Conclusion:**

I think the major factor here remains simply the desire of this sub to pile new money in. However, it‚Äôs hard to maintain this volatility level and ever higher prices for more than a few weeks without additional catalysts because options are getting pricey and decay will set in, and the higher the price, the more money is required to buy a share.

\- The margin changes, again, are definitely bearish. How bearish? That depends on how many of you guys bought a ton of GME shares on margin and whether or not we gap down Tuesday. I don't think it affects the short interest much.

\- The option situation is probably net bullish Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday, but net bearish Friday (slightly)‚Ä¶ but does mean that next week can be insanely volatile

\- Price moves are easier in the vicinity of $35, $30, $39, $40, and to a lesser extent, $45, $50, $55, $60 due to gamma 'ramps'.

\- I‚Äôll post new data when I get it. It could change the picture to be more clearly bearish or bullish, not just volatile. I'll try to lay out estimates of how many shares MM hold, and then updated gamma ramps, as well as expected MM position holdings at various price levels at the end of the week.

**Update 1-19 AM -** My tool hasn't received nasdaq data yet, but eyeballing the chart it's more or less as before. Large gamma ramp at 40 (huge option positions at 39/40). You saw this at open when you guys bid the stock, and MMs had to buy about 5m-6m shares to not be underwater, providing perhaps 2/3 of the initial buys. We then aw a loss of momentum in the gamma dead zone of the 40s. As I said, lifting into the mid to high 40s is a heavy. Bulls, you should not really pay a lot of attention to gyrations from 37-42, up or down, that's just dealers rolling over options. You had a strong start in any case, but that price zone is going to be extremely volatile this week.",DD,0.94

&#x200B;

if you don't know what a gamma squeeze is yet, you might be actually retarded. but basically when you buy OTM calls, the market makers who sold you those calls will hedge by buying a few shares depending on how OTM the call was (more shares as the call goes more ITM). when the price of the underlying moves up, the market makers will be forced to buy more shares to balance the gamma of the trade.

this creates an infinite loop:

1. underlying price increases
2. more calls get closer to being ITM
3. MM's needing to hedge their short calls by buying more shares
4. underlying price increase
5. shorts get squeezed/margin called
6. more calls get close to becoming ITM
7. MM's hedge more
8. share price reaches infinity üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

apart from just buying OTM calls there are a few conditions necessary for this to work:

* a reason for the share price to increase in the first place to start the infinite money glitch loop
* way more call buyers than put buyers
* a good amount of shorts sellers

&#x200B;

it is clear that $GME fulfils all of those conditions:

* ryan cohen has a few bombshells to drop and anyone of those could send the share price to the moon
   * build-a-pc kiosks
   * tweeting a üöÄ
   * gme roadmap
   * increasing his stake in the company
   * probably a lot more you can find in other DDs
* WSB has now >2m degenerates, our $GME posts can be found on r/all, r/stocks, r/investing, yahoo conversations, stocktwits, youtube, tiktok, heck we have so many boomers and fomo autists recently joining in for the squeeze, this stonk might even be more hyped than tesla.
* we do not just have a good amount short interest, we have a ONCE IN A LIFETIME WALLSTREET RECORD of 130%+ short interest and it is very unlikely or even impossible that they have all covered today (look up some of the float DDs).

Listen up retards,

Many of you are probably looking for a new direction from which tendies may fly. Well do I have a solution for you. It‚Äôs a big reverse course from the boomer dinner this sub ate over the past few weeks.

Yes my friends, I propose aggressive call options/long positions on the Airline industry, specifically Delta. Here‚Äôs why:

Past:

\- Going back to a report by Forbes, [Delta ranks best](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurabegleybloom/2020/07/27/covid-report-best-worst-airlines-coronavirus/?sh=48b3b5ff13af) in terms of cleanliness during COVID, meaning prevailing sentiment among travelers is high right now.

Present:

\- Delta is the [last major airline not filling middle seats](https://news.delta.com/delta-only-us-airline-block-middle-seats-limit-onboard-capacity-through-march-30-2021#:~:text=Delta%20will%20continue%20delivering%20on,now%20through%20March%2030%2C%202021), thereby spacing passengers out. 

\- This is good because, again it improves customer safety/feeling of safety during flights

\- This also means that they have been seating fewer passengers throughout the pandemic, while total profits have remained largely equal with their major competitors

\- Tighter self-imposed restrictions may mean fewer international restrictions, but this is more speculative than anything

Future:

\- Expects to hit profitability by July

\- Pandemic expense cuts to older aircraft should present a $400m decrease to annual costs, even when considering a ramp up in overhead as traffic increases

\- Delta expects at least 70% of their large corporate clients to return by the end of the year

Those final 2 points are from their last earning call, which means‚Ä¶ well of course theyd be bullish on themselves, but if its to be believed, then Delta is ready to come out of the pandemic strong. With a mix of leisure travel skyrocketing, business travel returning to some extent, and the holidays leading to a traffic spike right in time for Jan 2022 calls, I‚Äôm thinking of going hog deep in 65c at $1.61 a piece.

My main price suppressing factor is that [children aren't expected to receive the COVID Vaccine](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/children-coronavirus-vaccine-late-2021-experts/story?id=73364817) until late 2021. If children can‚Äôt get the vaccine then families cannot travel. I'm banking a lot here on the vast majority of Americans getting the vaccine in time for Christmas. As a result my theory leads me to the Jan 2022 options, rather than the Sep ones, as the holiday rush will play out before they expire.

Since these are deeply ITM they will cost just about the same as current price * 100.

331,DD,lbb9qk,2021-02-03 01:42:58,Cannabis stocks have turned into STONKS - my smooth-brain DD,"Listen here my fellow retards, my patience is running out on giving you free advice. I know short term meme stocks seem to be all the rage these days, but I believe the real tendies are being produced from the cannabis sector. 

MSOS (Cannabis ETF) is up 6% today and has already gone up \~25% on the year. Basically all the cannabis stocks have been exploding these past few months. I don't see this growth slowly down anytime soon and here are some reasons why.

* Both the **US and Mexico** are closing in on **federally legalizing cannabis**. Both of these countries are going to offer huge markets that will combine to be far bigger than Canada's current market.
* **More people are doing the 420**. Usage is going up everywhere and I don't see it dropping in the near future.
* Lots of cannabis companies are **getting majorly shorted** which is keeping their stock price down instead of going to the MOOOON üöÄüöÄ

Wouldn't be a fair DD without some risks though.....

* Although **US and Mexico** are strongly considering federal legalization, it **could still go south**. Backlash from legalizing or more important and pressing issues could easily push it to the back-burner or kill the idea all together for the near future.
* Although many health studies are coming out listing the benefits of cannabis, if some **serious health side-effects** come out in some studies it could scare people away from smoking the weed.
* There are far too many companies and lots of them are going to go **bankrupt** probably. Lots of room to get unlucky in your choices.

So what cannabis stonks should I be YOLOing into? A better first question might be: What should I be looking for in a cannabis stock?.

* **Profitable or near it:** Once the market really explodes it is going to be the companies with the cleanest balance sheets that are going to be able to make the big moves and print the real tendies. The companies with piles of debt and minimal profit will be left in the dust.
* **Has a foothold in multiple countries:** The more countries, states, licenses, land, etc., the better. All of these will allow for a head-start in the markets in that area.
* **Undervalued:** with lots of the cannabis stocks getting shorted to death, there are some cannabis stocks out there that I believe are extremely undervalued.

So what are your recommendations Mr. Smooth Brain?

* **APHA:** Tilray and Aphria are in the works of a serious and huge merger that will see them becoming one of (if not the biggest) cannabis company. Aphria's financials continue to be promising and Tilray's are not as solid but still decent. Aphria also acquired SweatWater giving them a solid start on cannabis related beverages. Aphria is the largest cannabis producer in Canada at 12.2% ([source](https://twitter.com/itsdgc/status/1356604397267124235)).  
So why APHA and not TLRY? When APHA and TLRY merge APHA shares will be .83 of a TLRY share. Because of this it is safe to assume APHA share price should = 0.83 x TLRY share price. TLRY share price is currently $25 which would mean that APHA share price should be around $20. For this reason APHA price being $15 right now is a steal assuming the merger goes through (looking promising for the merger to happen in Q2 this year).  

* **FIRE.TO/SPRWF:** I know what you are thinking.... ""this gay boomer bear smooth brain thinks a penny stock is a good idea!?!"".... hear me out. Supreme cannabis is one of those companies that never quite reached potential in the initial Canadian cannabis boom. Never had a real profitable quarter and has since been crushed to the ground by shorts ([source](https://shortdata.ca/stock/FIRE.TO/)). It has mostly been treated as just a dead stock and over the last few months people have dumbed on me for even mentioning this stock.  
I believe this is all about to turn around though. Supreme is having an earnings call on February 11th where I expect an extremely promising financial report and exciting upcoming news. Considering how undervalued this stock is (97 million market cap) it isn't going to take much to get this stock exploding. Volume and shorts have been exploding in this stock which shows huge promise. Supreme also makes up 3% of cannabis retail market in Canada ([source](https://twitter.com/itsdgc/status/1356604397267124235)). They also have connections in Australia and Israel markets.  


There are many more promising cannabis stonks out there and I encourage my fellow smooth brains to do their DD. Companies operating in multiple states are a safe bet ([check out this](https://www.greenmarketreport.com/the-cannabis-industrys-top-12-u-s-multi-state-operators/)). Also large companies like Canopy Growth, Curaleaf, etc. should all be decent stocks. If you are a retard interested in penny stocks check out FAF.TO and HITIF (along with SPRWF of course). 

Lots are coming out with earnings in the next few weeks, so keep your eyes out and remember to exercise those  üíéüôå

My positions: APHA 20@$7, SPRWF 4480@$0.13, (I know... r/babystreetbets)..... I plan on dumping more into APHA and doubling down on SPRWF after earnings come out.

**TLDR**: Cannabis STONKS  üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ. Exercise your üíéüôå and HOLD. IMO buy APHA and risk it on SPRWF, but do your own DD on cannabis stonks.",DD,0.87
332,GME,l8uu76,2021-01-30 21:25:46,The $GME squeeze will bring down Melvin. The Silver squeeze will bring down the biggest banks in the world. That's why Robinhood barred trading of $SLV the day after they took a billion dollars in loans from JPM and Goldman Sachs. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME.,"You retarted apes are growing up. I remember a year ago this sub was nothing but memes of J-Powell littered with rocketship emojis. Now It's GME posts littered rocketship emojis. We've come so far. 

Now listen:

If you think Wall Street is shitting their pants over the GME short squeeze you are 100% right. Jim Bianco lays out a [convincing case](https://www.financialsense.com/podcast/19847/jim-bianco-gamestop-and-great-short-seller-takedown#.YBTK3GAFZmU.twitter) that SPY was down 2% on Friday because hedge funds were dropping their ""safe"" stocks to raise capital for collateral against their rising margin debt on GME. 

But you also got to know this. At the same moment Robinhood halted purchases of GME, after calls from their hedge fund buddies, they also put on limits on $SLV. 

([Here is the list of all limited stocks](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-due-to-recent-market-volatility/) \- they've since added weird stuff like Starbucks, but $SLV was one of the first along with $GME and $AMC). I think that's pretty weird, considering that, unlike these other stocks, $SLV was up only a few percent on Thursday. It's even weirder when you consider that Robinhood had just been [bailed out by JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/robinhood-is-said-to-draw-on-credit-lines-from-banks-amid-tumult?sref=rY0z5sRB)! These fuckers are two of the worst silver manipulators out there. (Seriously. Link for [Goldman](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bank-nova-divestiture-goldman-sachs-idUSKBN1DS2C5). Link for [JPM](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/29/jp-morgan-settles-spoofing-lawsuit-alleging-fraud-in-metals-trades.html))

These banks have been raking it in on suppressing the price of silver for  decades. Look at this historical chart of silver. Does this make any sense? Silver was well over $30 for several years in the ***fucking 1980s.*** And now it's $27???

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8rf9ip323je61.png?width=1914&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8bfdbed2e78d08ef1d411241adc6d68141ede47

The fair price of silver, conservatively is CERTAINLY over $50, but it seems that there were some strings attached to JPM and GS's little loan to Robinhood. 

I'm balls deep in GME, but am riding this silver train too. Already last week $AG and $SLV were surging despite Robinhood's best efforts. If this thing breaks, both of those tickers will at least double. My personal price target for Silver is $70. The tendies from silver will be extra sweet for me  - nothing like breaking up the greatest cartel in modern history (apologies to OPEC). 

Keep fighting the good fight apes. We'll bring these bastards to their knees. 

My positions: $GME shares, $AG and $SLV shares and July calls.

#  Wait, WTF is a SHORT EXEMPT?

**- A short that doesn't have to follow the uptick rule, can be sold whenevs.**

# WHO THE FUCK SETS WHICH ARE SHORT EXEMPT?

# THE BROKERS, and it's not even checked unless an audit occurs

""...broker-dealers  are required to document their polices for how they mark orders as  exempt, and, if audited, provide evidence that they have followed their  documented policies and procedures. Broker-dealers therefore mark an order short exempt if they believe it  qualifies for an exception. The primary exception is the use of  non-standard pricing quotes for trade execution. **That means that if  prices come in outside the** [**National Best Bid or Offer (NBBO)**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nbbo.asp)**,  they can initiate a short-sale order that they judge would have  qualified as an uptick in more orderly markets.** Marking for these orders  is signified by SSE. All orders marked SSE will be closely checked by  self-regulatory organizations and the SEC for compliance with Regulation  SHO exceptions. "" **-Investopedia**

[Actual volume that is happening that is not a short.](https://preview.redd.it/vt3ae4bg07f61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=4dd6b9809074cb73e74304fe37ac76da5a12c297)

TLDR; Broker-Dealers are marking a HUGE AMOUNT of shorts as exempt from the uptick rule because all of our smoothbrained sell limits of $69420,69 are outside the National Best Bid, according to them, but it's ok because they are self-regulating.... **FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUU.....**

Today I went into Gamestop with the intent of browsing around and using a $25 gift card I got for Christmas like a year ago. I have not been inside a physical GME store since at least 2018 when I bought an Xbox. I immediately noticed that they have a much wider variety of merchandise, everything from games to PC hardware to toys and clothing. So on that note I was looking to buy a new PC gaming headset since I noticed they ""have"" a ton of them. I grabbed one and went to check out. The manager informed me that they don't actually have them in stock or available to order- in fact, most of the items in the store were just display boxes for promotional purposes. I thought this was weird, but she explained that:

**1- They sell in-store items so fast that if they didn't display empty boxes the store would look entirely empty. She gave an example of 200 packs of pokemon cards that sold out completely within 24 hours**

**2- They are reluctant to fill the store with generic items that don't move fast, because that store specifically, among ""3-4 others in the state"" are going to be totally redesigned to accommodate for what she described to me as ""PC building stations"".**  üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

**3- They have been absolutely crushing it with sales and store interest due to COVID. She stated that people are buying things that she has never sold before, like niche Wii remotes and other items.""**

Now, we have speculated for some time that GME is going to pivot to PC parts and hardware. I noticed that they do stock some PC peripherals and a few components like graphics cards (older models, they had an NVIDIA 1660 in stock) and PSUs. 

HOWEVER, I haven't seen or heard anything regarding a full-on build station. The way she described it to me, is that customers will be able to totally spec out a PC gaming rig, and have it shipped directly to their house. She said there will likely be a dedicated store employee there to assist customers and provide advice. THIS IS FUCKING HUGE. Currently, you have to be pretty ""in-the-know"" to spec out a gaming PC properly, and the pricing makes it unrealistic for a lot of gamers. On top of that, I think there is a perception that you need a lot more technical skill to get into PC gaming. What GME is doing will allow the PC gaming market to bust wide open and become more accessible for a lot more people. And finally, some sort of agreement or deal with the big manufacturers (as hinted) would make this even more lucrative!

She also said that there is a huge push from upper management for store employees to get knowledgeable on PC gaming and hardware- she said management is pushing hard for the company to step into the future. Meanwhile during the 30 minutes I was in the store, probably 10-15 customers came through and bought at least minor items. Keep in mind this is in a strip mall in a Midwestern rust belt town- certainly does not fit the ""Next blockbuster!1!!!"" thesis.

Personally I believe this is a very bullish move from Gamestop- and bodes well for the future on top of the other well-established information out there. GME is and continues to be an excellent value play, not even accounting for the upcoming short squeeze. It sounds like the vision from Cohen and others at the top is already filtering down to the people charged with carrying it out. I plan to buy at least 50 more shares on Tuesday.

""Oh shiiitt. This is amazing. I called a bunch of my local gamestops and luckily got a very talkative sales guy. He says that Gamestop Stores will be either 1.0 or 1.5 stores. The 1.5 stores will be more ""PC oriented"" and will allow users to choose parts. He didn't confirm ""PC building stations"" but dropped an amazing tidbit. The changes started in OCTOBER.... what else happened in October? Ryan fucking Cohen. This is amazing news and hopefully we hear more about it soon in media/press release.

edit: oh shit... I called this other Gamestop and he said the ""Cohen news hasn't materialized yet""... I said him being ""CEO"" and he grunted, I think affirmatively

edit 2: called another gamestop. Overheard them talking about ""reset"" of stores when I asked which store in area was 1.5

**Good Afternoon Retards.** Tilray (TLRY) has been having a nice start to 2021. This is only the beginning and there's still time for you to secure your first 10 bagger of 2021. üöÄ

**Why TLRY?**

It's all in the fundamentals. TLRY got the better end, at least in the short term, of the merger deal with APHA. The premium APHA will pay per share in this reverse acquisition will be of great benefit to TLRY's balance sheet. Tilray's massive potential has now been coupled with strong fundamentals. When (Yes, WHEN not if) weed is legalized in the US, Tilray, a company registered in the US, has the foothold in the US that, when combined with APHA's resources and distribution, will be a DOMINANT force in the market. üöÄüöÄüöÄ

Not only is Tilray in a good position to take over the US Cannabis market, but it also has a strong presence in Canada, where it is headquartered. The merger with APHA means TLRY will own 17.3% of the Canadian Cannabis market, **by far the largest** market share of any other Canadian Cannabis companies. 

**The US is a HUGE market to be tapped intoüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ**

Georgia Senate elections are **TOMORROW,** as of the writing of this post **BOTH** Democratic candidates are the betting favorites to win. **When this happens, the blue wave is complete and weed is all but legalized in the US.** A Democrat-controlled Senate was the last domino needed to fall. It is reasonable to believe that weed can and will be legalized in the US before the end of Q1 2021. 

Once weed is federally legalized, the market expands **EXPONETIALLY** in the US. Weed will become legal in large states such as New York. **Billions of dollars are just sitting that TLRY is in the best position to take** 

**TLRY is MASSIVELY undervaluedüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ**

As of 12/31, TLRY is trading at a very attractive 4.23 \* book value. MorningStar gives TLRY a fair value of 14$ (As of 1/1/21). Only 1 of 18 analysts have given TLRY a sell rating.

**Wall Street is bullish on TLRYüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ**

Since it has cooled down since the Biden rally, Tilray has consistently been reaching higher highs and higher lows. It is up around 6% at the time I'm writing this post. Put/Call Ratio is .1! Safe to say Wall Street is preparing for the Blue Wave and the legalization of weed, of which TLRY is in the best position to take advantage of the untapped US market.

I've posted on here a couple times before, I'm just interested in continuing to exchange quality plays to keep our tendies flowing. If you have any doubts, check out my last DD on $SRNE from a few weeks ago:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ky63a8/srne\_to\_the\_moon\_again/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ky63a8/srne_to_the_moon_again/)

Now, I know everyone is kinda busy right now with GME, AMC, BB, and the rest. However, if you do happen to be out of those names (or missed the ride and never got in), I have another stock that I would like to bring to your collective attention. Corsair Gaming (CRSR).

I've seen DD about this stock on here before, but it's been a little while and I feel like it deserves some more hype. For those who are not familiar, Corsair makes keyboards, headsets, and other peripherals for use in PC gaming and livestreaming, which is a rapidly growing market, especially in the wake of COVID-19 lockdowns.

Corsair IPO'd back in September, and they crushed their Q3 earnings report. Their quarterly revenue increased 60% year-over-year, and their net income was up **384%.**  They also released full-year guidance, and they expect to finish the year with $1.6B in revenue and $187M in EBITDA. These are huge numbers when you consider their market cap is only $3.4B! At this revenue level, they would only be trading 2X sales, which is not high at all considering the current market and the high-growth industry they operate in. It's also possible that they see a revenue boost due to the recent console cycle. This brought increased attention to gaming equipment, and generated a demand that other major players couldn't keep up with. If you wanted to buy the new PS5 at any point since it was released in November, odds are that you couldn't. I don't really have any data to back this point up, but in my personal opinion, that factor could have lead more people to invest in computer gaming in order to play the new next-gen games that were released with the new consoles.

Holiday shopping season + console cycle + low supply of competing hardware could equal a blowout quarterly report.

After the recent events with GameStop, I am surprised that this stock isn't getting more hype because its situation should be right up this sub's alley. Corsair has about 90 million shares outstanding, but most of those are owned by company insiders until the lockup period expires at the end of this month. Right now, the float is only 25 million shares, and half of that float is owned by institutions and another 2 million of those shares are sold short.

[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/crsr/institutional-holdings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/crsr/institutional-holdings)

In other words, there are only about 10-15M shares available to freely trade on a daily basis. This low float means that this stock can be easily manipulated by the big players, but this scarcity also means that in the event of good news, this stock could fly. Even if enough people try to pile in before earnings, the price could jump $5-$10 like it did last Wednesday. 

Corsair is going to report their Q4 earnings on February 9th, and I think that leading into that report, they could move back into the $40 range. After their last earnings they ran from $21-$51, so another move over $50 is not out of the question. I still haven't figured out options, so I have no idea what strike price or expiration date you should be looking at, if any. I'm playing this the only way I know how, accumulating some shares while it's under $40 and holding 'till next week.

TLDR: High-growth gaming stock could crush earnings next Tuesday. Low float = high volatility, so any good news could shoot it up.

This is **NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE**, please do your own research before entering into a trade. Simply presenting a trade that I‚Äôm excited about, and I‚Äôd love some feedback.

Also a way to boost revenues to close out Q4 earnings (and beyond).,"Disclaimer: I am not a tax expert. This is just my retarded brain trying to think through this idea. I‚Äôm also not the first to propose this idea. Just remember I can‚Äôt read so I didn‚Äôt see those other posts. 

For those that have made mountains of sweet, sweet tendies from the GME üöÄüöÄ, I am wondering if the income tax increase that many of us will realize this year can be reduced by also helping our Tendiemaker directly. This is more specific to Itemized tax filers. If you file Standard, this will only benefit up to $300, which would still be a big deal if tons of us did this up to $300. Itemized filers can deduct up to 60% of their AGI.

Edit: it was brought up that the $300 deduction only applies if the cash donation is given directly to the charity. I‚Äôm not verifying it, but it sounds plausible enough.

Edit 2: As u/whitemarshian points out, a better alternative to this strategy could be to donate the shares directly to a donor advised fund. I had not considered this strategy, but this also sounds like good shit. Maybe someone could expand upon this thought and put together another post exploring this?

SUPER EDIT: As u/MichaelVicksPitbull points out, buying gift cards will show up on the balance sheet as Unearned Revenue. This increase in liabilities would be offset by the increase in cash from purchasing the gift cards, so there isn‚Äôt really a net advantage for GME‚Äôs financials until the gift card is redeemed. This would be an unlikely benefit for Q4.

So here it is. Everyone fortunate enough to be aboard this moon shot heads over to their local GME before 1/31, and we collectively buy what amounts to hopefully millions of dollars in GME gift cards. We take those gift cards and donate them to The Ronald McDonald House or a local Children‚Äôs Hospital (St. Jude‚Äôs is well known, but I would suggest keeping your donations local to help your community) for them to buy electronics for their patients and patient families. My wife works for a Children‚Äôs Hospital, and there are many ‚Äúentertainment areas‚Äù packed with electronics throughout the hospital where sick children get a chance to escape the fight and reality of being sick. This is also an extraordinary relief for young family members of patients and parents as they can be occupied while their sibling or child undergoes tests or procedures or whatever.

We would be giving revenue a huge shot in the arm whenever the gift cards are redeemed, give GME tons of cash to end Q4, and by donating the gift cards to local charities you can reduce the tax burden on your gainz. This will also be a way for us to change the narrative and show those currently besmirching the name of WSB that we aren‚Äôt an army, we aren‚Äôt some nefarious insider trading collective, nor are we the thieves we are being painted out to be. We‚Äôre just a bunch of smooth brains trying to make money or lose it all for the sake of sweet sweet internet points.

Doing this would also not only give you üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ in your heart, but bless you with more üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ when GME hits $1,000.

If my true retardation is missing any of the key points, please let me know where I am misinterpreting the tax code and I will gladly amend this post.

Position: 1,450 stonks, 4/16 $30c and 7/16 $35c

More obligatory rockets: üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

TL:DR: Buy GME gift cards, donate them to The Ronald McDonald House or a local Children‚Äôs Hospital. Help sick children and their families. Reduce tax burden. Increase WSB love.

414,GME,l8aovz,2021-01-30 02:45:45,My GME Exit Strategy,"Hello retards and degenerates,

&#x200B;

Congrats on holding the line above $320 today. 

&#x200B;

As sad as it is, some of us would like to exit our GME position at some point in our lives. To strategize for this, I decided to do some quick math.

&#x200B;

As most of you degenerates know, VW temporarily became the most valuable company in the world in the great squeeze of '08. Well, why can the same not happen to GME? Surely, some will argue about the difference in the underlying financials between the two stocks. But to that, I ask, was VW ever shorted by 140%? Fuck no.

Let's do some quick math.

&#x200B;

Apple is the worlds most valuable company, at $2.215T.

GME has 69.75M shares outstanding

For GME to become the world's most valuable company, each share should be worth at least:

$2.215T / 69.75M = **$31,756 per share**

&#x200B;

Given the historical precedent of major squeezes becoming the world's most valuable company, I will be setting my limit value at **no less than $30,000 per share.**

&#x200B;

$1000 is not a meme. $5000 is not a meme. $10,000 is not a meme. and even $30,000 is not a meme.

&#x200B;

I'm not a financial advisor and I do not recommend you follow some blind retard hoping to change his family's life at the expense of these greedy fucks. All views are my own and again, I am retarded so do not follow my advice, I am simply explaining my own personal strategy.

I‚Äôm the meantime, you gathered up 10 coconuts into a bag. MELVIN wants your coconuts bad, or else that mean motherfucker he promised them to will bash his brains in, then throw half his body into a volcano and feed the other half to a shark.

So Melvin and Hedgy want to buy your coconuts from you. It cost you $1 a coconut to get them.

So Melvin and Hedgy pass the one ü•• they have back and forth and say ‚Äúhere, have this for 90 cents‚Äù, then ‚Äúno you take it for 80 cents‚Äù all the way down to a penny.

432,GME,lb9j2l,2021-02-03 00:16:32,Why GME is still in the game to trigger MOASS (MUST-READ BULLET POINTS),"Today was a crazy ride, and we've all been following the action the entire time. My opinion is that unless I can find compelling evidence that the squeeze is truly done for and off the table, my conviction has only grown stronger.

Most important things that stick out, all of which really build a case that must not be dismissed:

1) If shorts have covered, we should have noticed reasonable strong upwards momentum, as buying pressure consists of short covering along with retail buying, and a limited float.

2) Past few days we've seen trading volumes below average, likely suppressed demand caused by broker restrictions on buying. Lower volume can make any dump pull the price down easily. Especially when the demand side is getting locked out. Have to mention the timing of which Robinhood locked buying last week as well, coinciding with a massive dip.

3) Look at [this image](https://preview.redd.it/dralf2uks4f61.png?width=1900&format=png&auto=webp&s=52223e916aacb4f65681da1cfe4f5e1ade7cea30)

Notice how AMC & GME have almost identical candlesticks, and the same is in the BB-NOK pair. It is undeniable that a lot of people are buying this stock and holding this stock. Not just in America but all across the world. We have global support.
You would think that with this many people in the trade (whether they are on the buying / selling side) we would see greater variance. This correlation to me looks like obvious manipulation by higher frequency and higher volume algorithmic trading.
It's hard to look at these charts and say that this is natural supply and demand. Seriously, same candlestick patterns on unrelated stocks. This price action is influenced by targeted manipulation to a high degree. Even if people were really selling off like crazy, wouldn't we see more natural candles?

4) We have mainstream media (MSM) covering the ""reddit mania"" extensively. MSM says reddit is trying to squeeze silver, which is false. You will not find anyone pushing to buy SLV on reddit. In fact, you will see a warning about silver and how many HFs have long positions in it.

5) We've seen an influx of bots on social media (reddit, FB, twitter) promoting silver, spamming that GME squeeze is finished, diverting attention away from the more uninformed audience. Why? If it's finished why the need for these?

6) MSM says the short squeeze mania is over and shorts have covered. If that is true, why are we seeing trade restrictions still on more and more brokers, and nonstop coverage all over TV and the internet. If it's over, why are there so many articles bashing retail to stay away?

7) GME is an outlier in the ""failed-to-deliver"" statistic, and has been put on NYSE short restriction (uptick rule). Something fishy is going on with the shares in the float.

8) SI% numbers are very conflicting. Especially the numbers that came around 30-50%. It was then later mentioned by someone in S3 that a different calculation was used. If you convert to the old calculation, you still get over 100% SI%. Why are they trying to change it all of a sudden?

To me, this is enough to say we're still in the game. If it's over, let them prove it by crushing GME to $20 and on February 9th we hear the official SI% being low. Then it's finished. Something tells me that it's not over, and this is all a ploy to mitigate the damage they are about to receive when GME eventually triggers the MOASS.

Can't say for sure it's a 100% trip to the moon and beyond, but what's really suggested otherwise? This whole misinformation campaign + price manipulation combo is too important to dismiss.

Remember I'm retard and please make your own financial decisions. This post is based on my observation and speculation.

Hedging against this is something you would only do if you're shilling for a hedge fund. That's why they're called hedgies. 

Pay no attention to the mass downvotes and accusations of shilling to everyone suggesting silver. The ruling class would never seed a meme about silver being a distraction to divide the community from adding another major step to their plan.

Pay no attention to how major banks have sold 200x more silver than they actually have and if they're called to deliver on all those receipts instead of people continuing to be happy to just hold paper receipts they could *hypothetically* exchange, then... well, like I said, no matter.

The important thing is to spend your weekend wondering what will happen to GME while there is no action you can take on it. Don't focus on anything you could take action right now.

Don't sort comments by new. You don't want to see the unfiltered stream of consciousness of the subreddit, just stick to the carefully curated, vote-and-award-manipulated ranking of what everyone can agree on. We don't have any stickied threads sorted by new today because the people in charge here have your best interests at heart and they don't want you to get into trouble buying any silver. They're not like that other guy who tried to sell out the community, shame on him. Since they're not sellouts, there's no way they could ever make a mistake or allow the community to be misguided. Trust in them and blindly follow the subreddit's general direction at all times.

And most importantly, don't forget, you're very small. Silver has a market cap of $1.4 trillion. Big banks and governments have a vested interest in it. Don't you dare think your little wallets could possibly tip the scales of something this big going on right in front of you. Just take your tendies and quit while you're ahead, and don't think too much about where this is all leading next.

460,GME,lbv6iy,2021-02-03 20:00:11,GME Rollercoaster,"Listen up bag holders, üíéüñê, short bus riders.  

The euphoric feeling you had when you saw GME hit $500 intraday, with dreams of it hitting  $1,000 while yelling,‚ÄùI‚Äôm gonna cooom!!‚Äù and the depression accompanying it when it hit $80 yesterday, while you glance at those big, heavy fucking bags in your diamond hands, are nothing new for GME gang. 

It happened in October when it was halted based on MSFT news and then promptly fell back down to earth.  It happened in November/December RC penned the letter to the BoD, run up to earnings where it dropped so hard after omnichannel.  Then RC made a filing to up his stake mid December.  We all know when he tweeted ü•ú around 1/15 opex week.   

After every major drop, GME or RC drops something to quell those doubts. Case in point, they announced 3 new hires today. 

Most of the GME DD prior to the squeeze was that the catalyst for the squeeze would most likely occur in late March/April.  I still stand by that.  

The run up to 1/15 and the subsequent para move was mainly driven by the incredible amount of GME options exp then and the gamma squeeze initiated by retail subsequently sustained by the larger hedge funds.  It always felt inorganic, which was why most current bag holders expected more.  Yes it could‚Äôve reached $1000, 2000, 5000 even - had RH and other brokerages not royally fucked up and fucked every retail trader. Shorts may have covered through redemptions from ETFs with high concentrations of GME shares, they might have covered in other ways.  Who gives a shit.  The fact exists that there are still shorts.  We‚Äôve learned and seen all the dirty tricks in the book thrown our way.  We now know what to be wary about.  We‚Äôre not missing our second shot.  
 
Short Squeeze has always been the cherry on top of the GME DD.   The DD was always that it was an undervalued company.  How undervalued is anyone‚Äôs guess.  

If restrictions get lifted, and volatility drops a bit, who‚Äôs to say gamma squeezes can‚Äôt happen again and ride the tendie train every Friday? We seen how TSLA went.  I understand two different industries, valuations, etc.? But gamma squeezes are real and both have asymmetric forward return profile. TSLA rode our FDs like a motherfucker to the moon all last yr. 

If you‚Äôve lost money, you can cut your losses and do what is best for you and your family.  I‚Äôm not here to tell you to hold or sell or whatever you want to do with your money/financial decisions.  You can also hold to see how it will play out - you don‚Äôt lose if you don‚Äôt sell, because there are more catalysts to come (March earnings, 100M shelf offering, share buyback, expansion, LT roadmap).  Again, you do you. 

Just remember, for every high that GME has hit, it‚Äôs gone even higher than that in subsequent peaks.  I do think it will go higher than $500 at some point in the near future.  Gut feeling. Call me retarded. Call me crazy.  But that‚Äôs what everyone told me when I went in on GME in October.",Discussion,0.97

for $57.49, you can order same day pickup for a 6 x 3 banner from Staples. If you live near a major city like me, putting up one of these over the bridges that lead into the city might be the most cost-effective and fastest way to get word of what is happening to the average joe. 



If the mods approve this post, I will upload a link to order the banners and also a simple and free design that I personally plan to use. 

Any ideas of how we can do it better or perhaps coordinate a day when the shorts are really hurting?

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*.

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.

DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY.

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future.
