0,GME,lbavu0,2021-02-03 01:23:24,"The ratio of short volume to total volume confirms the GME sell-off over the last few days is shorting, not real selling. GME 🚀🚀","Many people here have pointed out that this selling seems artificial, multiple brokers report overwhelming buy orders, etc. The official data are in complete agreement with that. S3 and Ortex data are estimates, but FINRA data (from which the bimonthly official short interest reports are generated; this is the best there is) have shown that for the last five days, more than 50% of shares sold have been sold short:

[http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210202.txt](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210202.txt) (search GME; see also [2/1](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210201.txt), [1/29](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210129.txt), [1/28](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210128.txt), [1/27](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210127.txt))

[https://nakedshortreport.com/company/GME](https://nakedshortreport.com/company/GME) (pretty plot, though the data are slightly different from the official data given in the links above; both sources confirm that short volume has been > 50% total volume over the last five days, including today)

As an aside, according to that second website, [""if you see  more than 20% of your overall volume initiated short on a daily basis... you may be under \[a naked short\] attack.""](https://nakedshortreport.com/how-to-detect-short-trades) SEC, a little help, please?

In any case, the day before Robinhood and other brokers instituted the restriction on GME share and option buying was the last day that more than ***50%*** of *all GME shares sold* were not sold short. Shorts have been going in even harder on their shorting while they know buying is difficult for us. We win if we hold.

This is pretty definitive that shorts are causing the current crash, and they definitely haven't covered when doing so. It's mathematically impossible for shorts to cover if more than 50% of all shares sold in a day were sold short. Shorts are instead continuing to double down. GME will eventually rise, especially if Cohen and friends give some good news anytime soon (e.g., official company roadmap released, Cohen and friends buying the remaining shares they can, etc.). It will rise regardless of good news because shorts don't want to pay interest forever if a stock trades sideways. And as soon as all of us can buy an unlimited amount again, we can squeeze them once again.

I've shared FINRA data on here before and gotten some questions which have at this point become predictable, so I'm going to answer them below.

# Couldn't shorts open their position and cover by the end of the day?

No, because more than 50% of all shares were sold short, there were not enough shares for them to cover the shares they sold short even if every single share purchased other than a short share today was sold from a long to a short. It's mathematically impossible. They had to add at least around 10% of the total volume each of the last five days to their short position (most days had about 55% of shares sold short (some even more), and 100 - 55 = 45% not sold short; 55 - 45 = 10% more shares sold short than shares sold long). And I know that I bought more over each of the last few days, as did you glorious autists, so it was probably more than 10% of the total volume they were adding per day for each of the last five days.

# The total volume from those websites is less than the day's volume that my broker or another site tells me was traded

Yes, that's because FINRA only records data from specific markets/exchanges, not all of them. Although the total volume is less than what is sold over the entire market, the *ratio* of short sales to total shares sold is representative of the entire market, because they pull from the biggest exchanges. As mentioned above, FINRA is also the highest quality short data; the official bimonthly short data that is published is by FINRA pulling from these same data. These data are accurate.

Edit to add: I am not a financial analyst and this is not financial advice. Make up your own mind about everything. Also, I am long GME.

**Edit 2/4/21**: Short volume was again over 50% of total volume today. Hold, beautiful retards, hold. 💎👐

Obligatory 🚀🚀🚀🚀 (yes it’s the fucking name as you know)

Here are some cool bullet points, I don’t have pictures for those who can’t read. :(

Institutional ownership: ~95% (still near IPO price, they won’t sell anytime soon)

RKT has been consolidating for months with a fuck ton of long term investors.

ANECDOTE! I work in the industry and while anyone who does mortgages is up, market share is consistently eaten by the fucking whale that RKT is. Young people people do everything on the internet, and RKT is and has been in the drivers seat with major banks YEARS behind.

SPECULATION! RKT is forming a major partnership and will announce early this year. CEO Jay Farner confirmed this with Jim Cramer late last year. Now, who will the partner be? 

Rumor is that this person is Warren Buffet. He was granted an exemption not to disclose his position with the SEC last quarter as he seeks to build a larger position. He slashed his bank stocks last year, but loves banking/insurance businesses. He has a real estate behemoth and it would make total sense for them and RKT to partner.

 Also, Blackrock has acquired a 7% stake announced yesterday. 

Also, lockup expired yesterday...no one is fucking selling or has sold!

FuNdAmEnTals: P/E ratio is fucking 3.
Best retention rate in the industry (duh), minimal risk in a housing decline as they don’t hold their mortgages, they sell them to Fannie/Freddie (backed by the Government).

Sure maybe not a “tech valuation” but this should be a triple digit stock, if not this year then in the next few. If buffet does get in then this will be $100 pretty quickly.

Looking forward: this company is expected to blow out earnings this month as they continue to gain market share (as they are at least 5 years ahead of major competition), plus they have 2 super bowl ads this weekend.

If you are looking to be a ground floor person and not a chaser this is your opportunity.

TLDR: I buy $RKT, you should buy $RKT, make some tendies, and maybe you’ll get a blowjob or two from your wife or husband for being smart.

11,HOLD,l76f74,2021-01-28 20:39:31,This is why you should HOLD Shares and BUY more GME regardless of current price or volatility,"For those new comers who dont understand what is going on with Gamestop. As you can see there are 69.75M outstanding shares of which 46.89M shares are float (meaning they are available on the market to trade, other shares are held by the GME corp, CEO etc). The Shares (short) as of Jan 14 2021 shows  61.78M shares short. Meaning when there are only 46.89M shares available on the market, the shorted shares are more than the available ones. They need your shares to get out of their short positions. They have shorted more shares then the number of shares which exist. If you people HOLD or BUY more shares, the higher the value goes once the squeeze happens (When their short contracts expire, they would have to buy. If there are no shares to buy, the price goes to the Moon and beyond because of simple demand and supply. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Today was a ladder attack which showed very low volume when the stock was halted. It was there to scare off investors. Everyone should keep their shares held to themselves and buy more at any given price. May Gamestop be the most valuable company for a while on the squeeze just like Volkswagen did back in 2008.

&#x200B;

P.S ignore people who are buying BB, AMC, NOK because they think there may be a squeeze with those companies too or think they are too late to jump into GME squeeze. Remember, the squeeze will happen eventually. Volkswagen squeeze took almost 2 years, but GME will be wayyyy quicker because of the spread of the news and the sheer amount of people jumping in.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Buy GME in any way or HOLD it if you cant buy more.

&#x200B;

P.S: This is not financial advice. I LIKE THE STOCK THATS WHY I AM BUYING IT.

Aphria (**$APHA**) and Tilray (**$TLRY**) are merging to create the world’s biggest cannabis company. Close to 1B (874M to be exact) in annualized revenues which will only grow.

Anyways the merger states:

“Under the terms of the Arrangement, the shareholders of Aphria (the “Aphria Shareholders”) **will receive 0.8381 shares (the “Exchange Ratio”) of Tilray for each Aphria common share** (each, an “Aphria Share”), while holders of Tilray shares (the “Tilray Stockholders”) will continue to hold their Tilray shares (the “Tilray Shares”) with no adjustment to their holdings. Upon the completion of the Arrangement, Aphria Shareholders will own approximately 62 percent of the outstanding Tilray Shares.” [Source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201216005519/en/Aphria-and-Tilray-Combine-to-Create-Largest-Global-Cannabis-Company-With-Pro-Forma-Revenue-of-C874-Million-US685-Million)

This means Aphria should be trading at **.8381** of Tilray’s share price. Tilray is at $22.50 x .8381 = **$18.86**. Aphria should be trading at **$18.86**, yet it’s only at **$13.95.** That’s a whopping **34%** difference.

Considering Aphria is the stronger company and controls 62% of the combined company, it’s very rare for it to be trading so far away from the merger ratio. I’ve never seen a merger discrepancy like this before. If anything, Aphria should have the premium. Also, Tilray has high short interest so I doubt it will dip as shorts have to cover, it's most likely Aphria should catch up to Tilray's level.

**Aphria/Tilray vs. CGC**

Now let’s compare Aphria/Tilray to Canopy Growth. Canopy did 135M revenue last quarter which is approximately 540M annualized revenue along with a 96M net loss and a whopping adj. EBITDA loss of negative 85M. Furthermore, Canopy has -190M free cash flow, ([Source](https://www.canopygrowth.com/investors/news-releases/canopy-growth-reports-second-quarter-fiscal-2021-financial-results/))

Aphria did 160.5M revenue with Adj EBITDA of 12.6M. This will only increase as their next financials will have SweetWater Brewing on them. [Source](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/aphria-inc-announces-record-second-quarter-fiscal-year-2021-results-890905217.html)

Aphria expected to potentially be cash flow positive either this Q or next. “And we continue to work to be free cash flow positive in Q3, all subject to the intensity of COVID-19 restrictions in the markets where we operate. “

Canopy is valued at **15.8B USD**. Aphria/Tilray will be close to 1B annualized revenue, is EBITDA positive, and is valued at only 4.4 and 2.9B respectively. Not necessarily hating on CGC, the backing from Constellation is definitely solid, but when comparing the two Aphria should be valued higher.

Aphria leads Canada in market share ahead of CGC:  [Source](https://twitter.com/itsdgc/status/1356604397267124235)

Aphria also has a solid presence in the United States thanks to their EBITDA positive craft beer company, SweetWater who sells [cannabis-inspired beer](https://www.sweetwaterbrew.com/brews/420-strain-g13-ipa/).

Lastly, the U.S gov could act on some sort of cannabis legislature soon: 

[https://www.marijuanamoment.net/democratic-senate-leaders-announce-steps-to-federally-legalize-marijuana-in-2021/](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/democratic-senate-leaders-announce-steps-to-federally-legalize-marijuana-in-2021/)

**TL;DR:** Aphria should be trading 34**% higher** than its current SP due to the .8381 merger ratio with Tilray.

If you are interested in cannabis, I believe there is much better value in Aphria/Tilray compared to CGC.

42,DD,lbsi36,2021-02-03 18:13:13,DD $GOEV / Canoo's potential AAPL Partnership with a side of short squeeze 🚀,"First I want to congratulate us on breaking 8 million degenerates. I have been posting on this sub for over 3 years back when we were at only a couple hundred thousand. This is my first DD write up and I’m a little retarded so please go easy on me. 

For everyone who doesn’t want to read a wall of text there’s a **TL:DR** at the bottom.

**Technical Setup:**

Canoo has completed its SPAC merger and ticker change a little over a month ago going from HCAC to GOEV. Ever since the combination it has been piled into by shorts. The short position has grown exponentially from 99k shares to over 10 million as of the last update by NASDAQ. I subscribe to S3 Capital’s retail short algorithm which gives a more accurate current estimate of ~11 million shares short. New available shorts are nearly nonexistent and borrow rates are sky rocketing. If you haven’t been living under a rock the past couple of weeks you already know how well short squeezes can play out. 

[S3 short Info](https://imgur.com/RPVpzbu)

[NASDAQ Short Info](https://imgur.com/LrjJJCD)

[Share Borrow & Fees](https://imgur.com/esZFBfL)

**Fundamental Setup:**

GOEV has a ton of positive catalyst the shorts are overlooking and I believe this will lead to large losses on their side. For one, the EV revolution is here to stay as you can tell from the new administration. Biden plans to electrify the whole federal fleet (estimated 650k vehicles). GOEV  has the perfect mid sized commercial B2B purpose built vehicle which fits the build of many government vehicles. The Canoo purpose built vehicle can replace for example USPS mail trucks.

[MPDV Purpose Built Vehicle](https://www.canoo.com/mpdv/) 

Canoo’s leadership are veterans in the automotive industry which is hard to say for some of the other SPAC *cough * NKLA. Canoo's co-founder and CEO Ulrich Kranz was CTO at EV carmaker Faraday Future and more importantly has over 30 years of management experience at BMW. He worked to reimagine the MINI brand, develop the company's first SUV, and the iProject (BMW i8 & i3). They also poached talent from Tesla; Sohel Merchant (vehicle architecture) Christoph Kuttner (vehicle trim), and Alexi Charbonneau (proprietary EV skateboard tech) just to name a few. 

The real value here is their proprietary B2B skateboard platform for EVs. Allowing for any automaker to design and build their perfect sedan and just clip on to an already existing powertrain. Now AAPL is most likely going to sign an EV production contract with Hyundai/KIA (expected as soon as Feb 17th) confirmed last night by the  3.6 Billion investment. GOEV is already providing their platform to Hyundai/KIA. GOEV has already been validated by AAPL as in AAPL wanted to buy them out in 2020 so clearly they like their tech. And if you think that’s not enough to sell you on this theory then listen to this: In 2015, Apple almost used the BMW i3 as the basis for its Apple Car… the two founders of Canoo were the top guys on the iProject. It doesn’t take a genius to connect these dots.

49,SLV,l8uu76,2021-01-30 21:25:46,The $GME squeeze will bring down Melvin. The Silver squeeze will bring down the biggest banks in the world. That's why Robinhood barred trading of $SLV the day after they took a billion dollars in loans from JPM and Goldman Sachs. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME.,"You retarted apes are growing up. I remember a year ago this sub was nothing but memes of J-Powell littered with rocketship emojis. Now It's GME posts littered rocketship emojis. We've come so far. 

Now listen:

If you think Wall Street is shitting their pants over the GME short squeeze you are 100% right. Jim Bianco lays out a [convincing case](https://www.financialsense.com/podcast/19847/jim-bianco-gamestop-and-great-short-seller-takedown#.YBTK3GAFZmU.twitter) that SPY was down 2% on Friday because hedge funds were dropping their ""safe"" stocks to raise capital for collateral against their rising margin debt on GME. 

But you also got to know this. At the same moment Robinhood halted purchases of GME, after calls from their hedge fund buddies, they also put on limits on $SLV. 

([Here is the list of all limited stocks](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-due-to-recent-market-volatility/) \- they've since added weird stuff like Starbucks, but $SLV was one of the first along with $GME and $AMC). I think that's pretty weird, considering that, unlike these other stocks, $SLV was up only a few percent on Thursday. It's even weirder when you consider that Robinhood had just been [bailed out by JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/robinhood-is-said-to-draw-on-credit-lines-from-banks-amid-tumult?sref=rY0z5sRB)! These fuckers are two of the worst silver manipulators out there. (Seriously. Link for [Goldman](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bank-nova-divestiture-goldman-sachs-idUSKBN1DS2C5). Link for [JPM](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/29/jp-morgan-settles-spoofing-lawsuit-alleging-fraud-in-metals-trades.html))

These banks have been raking it in on suppressing the price of silver for  decades. Look at this historical chart of silver. Does this make any sense? Silver was well over $30 for several years in the ***fucking 1980s.*** And now it's $27???

The fair price of silver, conservatively is CERTAINLY over $50, but it seems that there were some strings attached to JPM and GS's little loan to Robinhood. 

I'm balls deep in GME, but am riding this silver train too. Already last week $AG and $SLV were surging despite Robinhood's best efforts. If this thing breaks, both of those tickers will at least double. My personal price target for Silver is $70. The tendies from silver will be extra sweet for me  - nothing like breaking up the greatest cartel in modern history (apologies to OPEC). 

Keep fighting the good fight apes. We'll bring these bastards to their knees. 

My positions: $GME shares, $AG and $SLV shares and July calls.

ORTEX showed a 6mil decrease in estimated SI from 72mil on 26th Jan to 66 mil on 27th Jan.

Thx to that guy who said that we can bypass paywall with incognito.

This gave us over 100% (150 per share) in gains. (Using after hours close to be conversative)

To hit 1k, assuming linear increase of share price to decrease in short interest, we only need 30mil shares to be covered, less than half of the current estimated short interest.

If we go by percentage increase, we barely need 15mil shares covered to blow past 1k (230% increase)

Here's the kicker, this shit isn't linear.

On the side of the prolapsed buttholes, panic increases as the price increases, even if the shorts try to diamond hand, they will get margin called.

On the side of us rocket bois, paper hands get shaken off and only the true diamond hands will remain, representing increased reluctance to part with shares.

In brief, the original demand supply problem now has increasing demand and decreasing supply.

Political

You hear the big fucks coming in talking about SEC investigation, stopping GME from trading and what not.

We already have DD on why there is nothing illegal happening here but I present the human angle.

Before anything, politicians need our vote. It is our vote that allows them to be in power to pull off whatever corrupt fuck.

The optics are already looking like the oppressed little guy fighting back against the big fuck face. The People against Evil Melvin.

Tendies don't have a party. This sub doesn't have a party. Right now we don't care who the autist next to us votes for, all we know is GME gang gang will tear 🌈🐻 a new one and we'll be rich and celebrate together from doing so.

Other than a few dumb idiots, no politician worth their salt would publicly do anything to stop GME. The backlash from the public would be MASSIVE.

We are in the right here. Melvin and co. can whine about it but any intervention on GME will be seen as foul play. Good luck getting a single vote out of any GME holder if they try fucking with us.

Positions, 200 GME shares @ 34.95

Edit: Msg from u/GMEsquoze who cant post. Dude has GME positions so

PT calculation for GME

All 3 are from premarket from a 3 minute candle setup. Times for each candle are 9:15, 9:18, 9:27. Why these candles? They are completely green with no wicks.

9:15 Low 248 High 268 Volume 336k Price Range is 20$ 1$ per 16.8k Volume

9:18 Low 267.77 High 327 Volume 948k Price Range is 60$ 1$ per 15.8k Volume

9:27 Low 324 High 354.8 Volume 564k Price Range is 30$ 1$ per 18.8k Volume

My reasons for using these candles is because there was no resistance on em when I was watching, they just went up indicating institutional buying. Assuming I am correct we have 1$ move per average 17.13k Volume. We have ~70M shares shorted on GME, which accounts to ~4k$ price move. We are currently trading at 330$. If they outright cover all the shares, which they won't we will arrive at a PT of 4.3k$ for 0 Short Interest on GME. This PT also doesn't include the gamma squeezes from MM, and the bullish buying from investors. So I would say the most conservative PT for GME would be the most unlikely scenario which is 4.3k$ if the shorts just cover the entire SI. Otherwise this can keep going higher for completely different reasons as I mentioned.

In my opinion, $BB got wrapped up in this $BANG phenomenon and is being attached to avoid any further losses by Big Money. There is so much good going for this company right now and $BB discussion has been relatively quiet. This dip is an absolute discount fire sale right now and although I am not a financial adviser and do not offer this as advice I am definitely thrilled about the buying opportunity and will definitely be capitalizing on it. Although I have been a member here for a short period and only trading for a few years now, I like to think I know a solid value play, especially in tech thanks to you smooth brains, when I see one. 1 - 3 years and this stock will make the difference between retiring comfortably on time and retiring early with excess spending money.

I'm here to tell you that's not how it work. Diamond hands means diamond hands, you hold, i know greed is a big factor and you want more money but if we want the price to skyrocket (potentially going up to 10k, very possible based on 2008 shorts squeeze) we have to hold.

I remember a year ago this sub was nothing but memes of J-Powell littered with rocketship emojis. Now It's GME posts littered rocketship emojis. We've come so far. 

Now listen:

If you think Wall Street is shitting their pants over the GME short squeeze you are 100% right. Jim Bianco lays out a [convincing case](https://www.financialsense.com/podcast/19847/jim-bianco-gamestop-and-great-short-seller-takedown#.YBTK3GAFZmU.twitter) that SPY was down 2% on Friday because hedge funds were dropping their ""safe"" stocks to raise capital for collateral against their rising margin debt on GME. 

But you also got to know this. At the same moment Robinhood halted purchases of GME, after calls from their hedge fund buddies, they also put on limits on $SLV. 

([Here is the list of all limited stocks](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-due-to-recent-market-volatility/) \- they've since added weird stuff like Starbucks, but $SLV was one of the first along with $GME and $AMC). I think that's pretty weird, considering that, unlike these other stocks, $SLV was up only a few percent on Thursday. It's even weirder when you consider that Robinhood had just been [bailed out by JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/robinhood-is-said-to-draw-on-credit-lines-from-banks-amid-tumult?sref=rY0z5sRB)! These fuckers are two of the worst silver manipulators out there. (Seriously. Link for [Goldman](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bank-nova-divestiture-goldman-sachs-idUSKBN1DS2C5). Link for [JPM](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/29/jp-morgan-settles-spoofing-lawsuit-alleging-fraud-in-metals-trades.html))

These banks have been raking it in on suppressing the price of silver for  decades. Look at this historical chart of silver. Does this make any sense? Silver was well over $30 for several years in the ***fucking 1980s.*** And now it's $27???

&#x200B;

The fair price of silver, conservatively is CERTAINLY over $50, but it seems that there were some strings attached to JPM and GS's little loan to Robinhood. 

I'm balls deep in GME, but am riding this silver train too. Already last week $AG and $SLV were surging despite Robinhood's best efforts. If this thing breaks, both of those tickers will at least double. My personal price target for Silver is $70. The tendies from silver will be extra sweet for me  - nothing like breaking up the greatest cartel in modern history (apologies to OPEC). 

Keep fighting the good fight apes. We'll bring these bastards to their knees. 

My positions: $GME shares, $AG and $SLV shares and July calls.

140,GME,l9ywyz,2021-02-01 09:58:35,Things to remember on Monday if you hold GME stock,"# Remember hedge funds have the weak hand

They had to realise gains from other investments just to cover losses from GME. Thursday and Friday were the days with the biggest deleveraging sisnce March 2020. Each day they have to pay high interest just to mantain the short positions, and you know what? Every time they realise gains to cover losses their performance gets worse, and this makes them look like idiots in front of their clients, putting their business in danger.

# Expect some crazy volatility

Remember you are playing against hedge funds, they are not going to give you free money. There is no free money in the stock market. GME investors hit them hardly, and for them is not just about losses but they have to proof to their clients that they cannot be beaten by a bunch of redditors. They may suppress the price or manipulate it. There are some excellent posts on this sub about how they manipulate the stock price (ladder attacks, MSM misinformation, etc).

# Manage your risk

I hold GME since $20s. For me right now there is no risk in holding the stock because it will never go back to that level. If you just bought at $300 have in mind they may be able to supress the price for days or weeks to $100-$200 level, so you must be able to stomach this volatility. I would recommend only investing money you can afford to lose to not panic sell if you see this wild volatily.

The important thing as an investor is to hold, more than to buy like crazy.

# Be a critical thinker, do your DD

There is nothing that the MSM wishes more than to see loss porn from retail investors to say ""see, they didn't know what they were doing"". Please, don't give them the opportunity to say that.

Do your DD, check user history whenever you read something to make sure users are no hedge fund trolls. Hedge funds are now trying to focus you attention on everything except GME. The Silver play is a trap. Citadel is long silver. 

# BEWARE THAT IF YOU BUY SILVER, you are helping Citadel to cover losses with their gains and give them the chance to fight on GME.

Maybe mods should ban silver posts as lots of people could potentially lose money on that play.

&#x200B;

TLDR:

DO YOUR OWN DD. BE CRITICAL.

HOLD. THEY HAVE THE WEAK HAND, NOT YOU.

BEWARE OF SILVER.

For SEC minions reading this: this is not investment advice.

Edit 1: many thanks for the awards guys.

Edit 2: WSJ and Bloomberg are pushing the silver narrative and creating the impression that somehow people here are coordinated which is complete false. Also Citadel is long silver and it seems posts are being created mainly by bots. I definitely think mods should take action.

Edit 3: about silver, it is not my call, I am just sharing my point of view, I totally get the people who says nothing should be banned. Just have in mind MSM are depicting WSB as a group of organized investors that are colluding to target different assets, which is completely false. Should their message gets acceptance because of SLV they could try to ban this sub. So I think mods should at least check if those posts are legit, and if they comply with the rules.

Okay GME gang. We’ve got the shorts on the ropes. They’re bleeding hard and all the billionaire suits are shitting themselves out of fear. They’ve tried false information, getting on CNBC and screaming for regulation of our “market manipulation,” trying to get us shut down, Biden administration tweet, saying shorts have already covered, etc. None of it has worked so far and they’re still bleeding money.

Now they’re truly desperate. What’s something they haven’t tried quite yet but very well could be setting up to do?

MARKET CRASH

Yes, that’s right. I believe with what I’m currently seeing, they are going to crash the market and blame it on us. Do I think you need to be concerned about GME? No, because holding it should still work and they still have to cover anyway, but this is definitely to try to get you scared and sell GME and so they can take your money back when you reinvest elsewhere.

I don’t think I have to tell many of you that the current levels are at/above where the market was valued in 2008 before the crash according to the Buffet indicator. All this says is that we’re probably in a market bubble, and it’s been at these levels for months now. But guess what just started getting talked about by all the suits? That’s right. A bubble. And who are they blaming? Us.

Now that I have your attention, let’s look at a few other things.

[This is the Volatility Index the past week.](https://imgur.com/gallery/C9ETmMR) Notice how it’s been steadily rising and suddenly spiked today? 40 is typically the resistance before the market makes a downturn. If this thing gets above that we’ll probably be seeing the market dropping quickly.

Additionally, there the spurts of high volume absolutely dumping stocks for short amounts of time. That’s one of the first things I noticed before the March crash and I’ve been seeing it get more and more abundant the last few weeks and picking up a lot today. [Notice the large red volume candles on the weekly SPY chart.](https://imgur.com/a/w0y33Lq) (Robinhood screenshot on a DD post??? Yes, I know. I’m on my phone with limited time. Deal with it lol.)

Now you might say, “it’s earnings season and there have been some bad earnings so far and that’s expected in this tough time.” Well yes, but there’s the Apple earnings today. They beat earnings pretty nicely and what did the stock do? [You guessed it (I hope).](https://imgur.com/a/Txc7po6)

Currently we’re seeing fundamentally strong companies as well as the S&P 500 beginning to drop and the volatility increase market wide. You could say this is “smart money” pulling out because they see the overvalued stocks. However, there were many worldwide financial issues sparking before the March crash. It just needed a catalyst, AKA global pandemic. Now we’re in a similar boat. Market issues in need of a catalyst.

What is that catalyst this time around? That’s right. A bunch of “millennials on a message board who have no place in stocks creating a market bubble.” Basically this isn’t smart money pulling out here. It’s MAD MONEY (hi Cramer). They are declaring WAR. They are pissed that we are “stealing” their billions on billions of dollars from them and they will do whatever it takes to get you to sell and take your money away from you again, including wrecking the market and the economy once again. The suits are out for blood now.

Do I think this will effect GME much? Only if you don’t sell. All this is scare tactics and ways to win your money back if keeping GME suppressed fails even more than it already has. There are hardly any shares to short if any at all and retail investors and autists are likely the ones holding most of the shares that could be sold.

Be careful out there autists

Usually, stock price, especially for smaller caps, sticks to future pricing and aligns with US pre-market trading once open.

Also interesting, German broker Trade Republic has reversed the ban on trading GME. The firm said, restrictions were necessary to protect stability of trading systems, risk management and clients.

\#Edit 1: Just to give an additional perspective, the last two days, GME opened green in Germany, went high and dropped to US-prices when pre-market trading opened (still green but lower price).

In the past we have been value holders of GME three other times and started a small position today nears it's intraday high and will likely add to this next week should the stock fall.   Previously all my Reddit comments have involved my e-Skate collection or my landing of my airplane in challenging conditions (see: [https://youtu.be/Rn7XoYKlZl0](https://youtu.be/Rn7XoYKlZl0)) However, I can't resist commenting on the fascinating technical factors that likely will continue to propel this issue higher - perhaps significantly so over the next few weeks.  Andrew Left's mocking derision of retail investors may prove to be his waterloo.  Why would a value focused fund manager buy a stock that based on classic fundamental value analysis appears significantly overvalued?  

GME appears to be a very interesting example of individual stock reflexivity.  What is reflexivity you ask?  This is the theory, originally promoted by George Soros that the stock market itself can cause the economy to either rise of fall (as opposed to the classic teaching that the economy affects the stock market).  An example of market reflexivity would be the great depression whereby a crashed market brought down an economy that was only in an ordinary recession, or the recent improvement in the economy, not withstanding Covid, which has followed a rising market.  In GME's case the rise in the stock price itself will likely result in fundamental improvements to the underlying economic metrics of the company.  Why?

1. As the price of the stock rises, GME finds itself in the enviable position where it can use it's stock at currency to buy complementary businesses it could not otherwise afford - monetization of the current short squeeze by the enterprise will lead to fundamentally higher revenue and profits of the enterprise should they find good strategic acquisitions to further monetize their large retail customer base (which has real and to date largely untapped value).  The company is likely right now on the hunt for a major acquisition that could fundamentally alter the companies future prospects with that acquisition largely paid for on the back of short seller covering.
2. Monetization of the short covering increase in share price via issue of a secondary .   The $500 million in debt (net of cash) the company currently has could be entirely extinguished with a secondary that is dilutive of only 10% of the equity base.  In fact such a secondary will, despite this dilution, likely result in a significant price rise for the stock (versus the usual fall in price after most, but not all, secondaries).  Bankruptcy risk will largely be eliminated with this secondary as will interest rate risk and financing costs ultimately increasing cash flow per share.  A 20% secondary will leave the company in a strong cash positive position with this cash available for expansion of sales efforts, cloud offerings, acquisitions, etc.
3. Directly increased sales and revenue by virtue of the large amount of attention this epic short squeeze has brought to the company.  I suspect most long retail stockholders have explored the companies web offerings and are considering becoming customers.  This is free advertising to people with money who are tech savvy and the exact demographic GME would target with paid advertising.  
4. Retention and efforts of existing management now becomes easy.  Every manager there wants to see this continue.  Operations at companies with sinking share prices typically suffer as management and employees leave the enterprise or develop anger and lassitude (think Sears Holdings).   The opposite is occurring here with every manager trying to beat their numbers to see the squeeze continue.
5. This issue remains extremely heavily shorted.  Despite the squeeze that has already occurred, other ""value"" based investors have dived into short positions as the price has risen.  The short positions of this issue appears (although I can't be certain) to exceed 100% with all available shares already lent out from marginal accounts and probably a lot of naked shorting going on as well.  Although I don't yet have the current data on todays short position, I can say for certain the stock remains very heavily shorter, perhaps more so now than at any previous time.  Today, I called my broker asking about the availability of shares to short and the borrow costs.  We have one of the larger accounts at our brokers firm and I was able to speak directly to the ""hard to borrow"" desk.  No borrowable shares are available at any broker, anywhere, at this time, even for high borrow costs or even from other brokers.  This extreme short against a small common float, made more extreme no-doubt by naked shorting, could end very poorly for those short this issue.  As they are forced to close out their positions, the stock will continue to rise and continue to exacerbate the positive effects the rising price has on the above 4 issues.

Impossible to know really where the stock goes from here as there does currently exist a disconnect from fundamentals. However, the extreme short position against the unrestricted common float here suggests to me there is a much greater chance of GME's price continuing to increase, perhaps significantly so, and this chance is far greater than the now fearful pundit in hiding's proclamation that the stock would soon see $20.

For what it's worth, over the past 13 years of this funds life, we have significantly beaten both the overall market and the dow,  (12.2%/year margin over DJIA inclusive of dividends since 2008).  We  have had plenty of losing issues despite this beat but also way more big winners, some really big.  Right now my money's with the retail investors who are long GME.  We only have a small position here but this may prove a big winner for us also.  Cheers.",Discussion,0.97

Hi Gary I have read many articles similar to Yours in the past day that reddit users are behind this silver push. I'm sorry to say this is not the case. I understand you implied that according to CNBC reports it isn't understood whether it is longtime reddit users or perhaps larger organisations at play here. I don't consider myself a long time user but I joined the community at a mere 1.8m members. That number in the few months I have been a wallstreetbets member has ballooned to 8milion+. I would urge you to check out the site and see for yourself the overwhelming sentiment that silver is simply a distraction. We love GME stock, we are not bored of it and the due diligence shows evidence that an extraordinary short interest DOES still exist for it. It would be wonderful to see a detailed article on this and I'm CERTAIN this would attract a lot more attention and clicks than another WSB LOVES SLV article. I'm not trying to demean your work in any way. 
Hope you have nice day, all the best.

Edit - I've had quite a lot of messages concerning WSB's interest in silver dating back from long ago, long before I was a member so I just wanted to clarify something. 
Here is a clarification : 
I wanted to reflect the disparity between how few silver posts I was seeing on wsb in and around the time of the media hype and how so many media outlets were pushing the "" WSB's next target is silver!"" agenda. Of course this community is so big that there must be lots of diversity and it was a little ham-fisted to suggest nobody on the sub is buying silver. The important point in my mind was that MSM as I saw it had blanket reported something about the subreddit I believed was an inaccurate representation of the real sentiment.",Discussion,0.91

1. Cover at the lowest price possible
2. Buy the shares they need to deliver by TODAY for all the calls that were exercised Friday at the lo
3. lowest price possible

**There is no way the real short interest percentage is 53% but even if it is, THATS STILL HIGH AF!** You think these greedy HF's are just going to cover and then leave the stock alone? Right now they think they have you on the ropes so they're tripling down and shorting this shit on the way down! You know what that means? They're shorting it at $115 instead of $450 which is WAYYY more risky. It's super easy to justify $115 fundamentally for GME without even taking into consideration the squeeze.

168,BB,l94t1a,2021-01-31 05:46:24,"$NOK is almost certainly a plant. $GME is the most mechanically likely to squeeze, followed by $AMC and $BB","Sup retards, I rejoined to try and warn you all of the market crash last week thursday, and none of my posts and comments got through, not sure if this will either. 

I'll keep it short and sweet. $NOK is almost certainly a fucking plant, meant to bait you all into buying.

- High float, low price, perfect for retail to pile into
- It's not shorted much at all
- People only started mentioning it *very* recently last week. Out of the non-GME recent meme stocks ($AMC, $BB, $NOK), it's the most recent.
- Retail has gotten fucked on $NOK in the past
- The 5G thesis is great, but it's old fucking news

But OK, all the stuff above is more or less conjecture, let's assume I'm 100% wrong as an unreformed 🌈🐻 (still think that market crash is coming BTW), here's some signal [take another look at the stocks that Robinhood has restricted and how severe the restriction is](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-due-to-recent-market-volatility/) (as of 1/30):

| Symbol | Allowed Share purchases | Allowed Option Purchases |
|---|----|---|
| $GME | 1 | 5 (minimum of any of them) |
| $AMC | 1 | 10 |
| $BB | 1 | 10 | 
| $NOK | 5 | 10 | 

Which one of these is not like the other? $NOK is basically the least restricted (on both dimensions). I'm personally not super convinced on $BB either but meh.

Just like most other posts on WSB, this is not financial advice. Make your own investment decisions and know when to sell, because when the squeeze ends it will end fast -- make sure you and your friends talk about and exit strategy, we want to sell into Melvin, Citadel, and their friends, not each other. Once liquidity hits zero it would be great if someone started a count of how many shares were bought at the elevated prices.

I will echo something I read in another post here -- for all the 4MM new people here, **WSB LOSES MONEY ON AVERAGE**. We post and celebrate loss porn. $GME is the only safe bet right now, it will be green even in a sea of red because what's happening right now is mechanical, assured. The shorts have not completely covered yet, and they will. It's not about fundamentals, it's not about technicals, it is market mechanics.

[EDIT] People in the comments suggesting I haven't been on this sub long enough to understand why each individual stock is squeezing. Let me lay it out (please let me know if I'm wrong) so people stop suggesting that

- $GME rocketed because short squeeze + gamma squeeze
- $AMC rocketed because short squeeze + gamma squeeze + recent 900M cash infusion, Bankruptcy is 100% off the table
- $BB rocketed because of optimism around security, lack of compromise in Solarwinds
- $NOK rocketed because 5G, and some idea of being under valued (this one I admit I don't understand)

Shut the fuck up about it. If you know the above this post isn't for you.

This post exists to *dispel the fiction that half of these are legitimate short and/or gamma squeezes*. If you thought that $BB and $NOK were short squeezes, YOU ARE WRONG. They *MIGHT* gamma squeeze but certainly not with the restrictions on them.

[EDIT 2] It looks like people are still confused about brokers. There are three brokers that I can recommend, if you're trying to express a view on this market:

- Fidelity
- Vanguard
- TD Ameritrade ([see their restrictions](https://www.tdameritrade.com/td-ameritrade-trading-restrictions-stocks.page))

If you're thinking ""You're a fucking plant, how could you recommend TD Ameritrade?"", calm your tits. I have been posting since last week about the *actual* restrictions that are in on TD Ameritrade, fucking read them -- **you *CAN* buy $GME and $GME calls on TD**. The media misreported and never actually listed what the restrictions were for TD (they were one of the first to restrict).

NOTE: I DO NOT KNOW IF TD WILL CHANGE IN THE FUTURE, SO THE SAFEST ARE FIDELITY AND VANGUARD.

Also, I will shill for TD a bit -- when I dumped RH last year because they cost me money, I moved to TD and they forced me to do their education stuff on options and shares and futures before being approved for level 2 options (I'm not a fan of lying on my applications to financial institutions). I actually really fucking enjoyed it and learned a lot. I don't know how they're going to change since they merged with Chuck Schwab, and you could say that all their ""education"" schtick is actually just bullshit to convince you that you know what you're doing *before* you give the big boys your money, but I really like TD.

See my previous comments about TD's actual restrictions from when I called them, on the phone, like a boomer:

First – Monke Diamond Hands Banana Rocket Rocket Rocket Rocket Moon

**This is not financial advice. This is speculation based on my limited understanding of SEC rules and documents. Sources linked. Please read edits.**

**TLDR**: **My opinion** is that Shorts will continue to drive the price down with ladders and try to break the chain of consecutive days where GME is listed as a threshold security. ~~They need at least 1 non-Failure To Deliver day before EoD Thursday.~~ **If** ~~they~~ **an individual short gets even 1 day without** **~~aggregate~~** **Failure To Deliver then the entire 13 consecutive day count restarts \*for that short.** ~~They~~ **The shorts as a whole need 5 consecutive days without aggregate Failure To Deliver to have GME fully removed as a threshold security. Selling is good for them and bad for diamond hands. Ape strong together. Diamond Hands get the Rocket Ship.** **No idea if achieving 13 consecutive days will force the squeeze or not.**

&#x200B;

**My opinion** is that Shorts don’t plan to cover their position by Tuesday. They don’t have to. Instead, they will drive the price down for as many days as possible and attempt to break the chain of consecutive settlement (read: business) days where they fail to deliver. GME has been listed as a **threshold security** (see below) for ~~10~~   \*37 consecutive business days (please check my math. I had to count on my fingers). \*Individual Shorts (not the short collective as a whole) need to break their chain of failure to deliver on that threshold security before it reaches **13 consecutive business days**. “Participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out fails to deliver in ‘threshold securities’ if the fails to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days.” \[SEC Rule 204\] (link below)

**If diamond handed monke can HOLD strong and reach 13 consecutive days \*of failure to deliver\* as a threshold security, then the shorts** ~~will~~ **(in theory) should have to cover the positions by buying GME shares or equivalent shares of like kind and quantity.** ~~If maths good, that puts Thursday Feb 4th as day #13.~~ **Ape hold strong.**

**\*\*Edit 5: Math not good. Jan 18th was holiday. We are at 37 consecutive days. Edit 3 & 6 at bottom for more details.**

&#x200B;

We've seen confusion, fear, uncertainty, and doubt surrounding what happened Monday Feb 1st. Remember that FUD is one of their greatest weapons against retail investors right now. They want to use it to divide retail and to convince people to sell based on emotion. I’M NOT FUCKING SELLING!

**Warning: I am not a financial professional or a financial advisor. I read at a grade-3 level. This is not financial advice.**

\- Read below here if you can or care.

1. Why no squeeze Monday after $320+ close on Friday?

Shorts weren’t required to cover their positions on Monday. I think that they have T+2 (time of close + 2 business days) to cover their position. If true, this means they have until EoD Tuesday to cover. After that, they will have failed to deliver on the security. That isn’t good for them, but it isn’t as bad as it sounds. Failure to deliver is like a steppingstone in the process. After 5 consecutive business days with \*aggregate Failure To Deliver, the stock is listed as a threshold security. NYSE Threshold Securities can be checked here [https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)

It takes 13 consecutive days being listed as a threshold security before the positions must be closed **(If the rules still apply to them)**. \*I believe this is individual short positions that must be closed not all the shorts as a whole.\*

So, instead of covering, shorts spent the day driving the price down to a more favorable position for them. They may have scared away some paper hands along the way too.

2. How does that help the shorts?

Lower price means it costs less to cover and the Shorts have more room to negotiate with other funds. A cheaper darkpool buyout is good for them. If they can lower it enough, covering becomes a non-issue compared to a full on squeeze.

Shorts want to avoid days where GME fails to deliver and they want to create non-Failure To Deliver days to break the chain of consecutive failures to deliver. This is easier for them if the price is lower.

3. So squeeze on Tuesday/Wednesday right?

I don’t think the squeeze happens Tuesday or Wednesday. I think the shorts are setting up the next part of their plan. I think if the squeeze happens this week, it happens because the shorts reach 13 consecutive days where they fail to deliver. This means diamond hands and limiting the number of cheap shares that shorts can buy after ladder attacks aka diamond hands.

4. We’ve heard this before. So what?

I agree with the idea that adding RC & friends to the board had a positive influence on the stock price. I don’t think that was the only thing happening when we saw price rise during mid-January. Going back to the idea of 13 consecutive days as a threshold security, we can refer to our NYSE tracker [https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)

~~Starting at the beginning of the year, we see that Jan 4th is the first day GME is marked as a threshold security~~.<- True but it was already listed as a threshold security starting Dec. 8th. It stays listed as a threshold security through Jan 15th. Remember we don’t count weekends so the count resumes  January 19th (18th was a holiday) ~~January 18th. On the 18th, it falls off the list for the day and comes back on January 19th.~~ ~~Without this single day drop-off, the 13-day countdown would have ended at EoD Wednesday Jan 20th.~~ I believe that the price jump we saw can be partially attributed to the fact that \*some of\* the shorts NEEDED to avoid another Failure To Deliver or they would risk being uncovered. That was pre-spike. Now ~~they~~ some shorts are in a similar position closing in on \*their own\* 13th consecutive day. They will do whatever they can to avoid that 13th consecutive day because that means they will avoid having their record books searched through by someone outside their firm/fund.se

**Threshold Securities**

Def: Threshold Securities are equity securities that have an aggregate fail to deliver position for

· Five consecutive settlement days at a registered clearing agency; and

· Totaling 10,000 shares or more; and

· Equal to at least 0.5% of the issuer’s total shares outstanding.

Edit 2: It has been brought to my attention that I didn't count Jan. 18th as a holiday when checking the threshold securities list. Going back to check my work now and will mark any edits that are made. Information will not be removed, but I will do my best to address any mistakes I have made. Thank you for your help.

&#x200B;

Edit 3: Dec. 25th, Jan. 1st, and Jan 18th were all holidays and NYSE was closed. Going back we see Dec. 8th has GME listed as a threshold security. It was correctly pointed out ( u/AlexGu812 ) that this brings us to 37 consecutive days. I don't know enough about this stuff to confidently say what that means. I think it may have to do with the close-out requirements or it could be a sign of bad faith actions.   ""The requirement to close out fail to deliver positions in threshold securities that remain for thirteen consecutive settlement days does not apply to any positions that were established prior to the security becoming a threshold security"" <-- This may explain why we haven't seen mass closeouts despite passing the 13 day threshold.

Edit 4: If you feel this doesn't matter because the SEC won't enforce it then please consider contacting your representatives. Rules and regulations should be enforced. We can't encourage a lack of action just because things are hard or more complicated than we thought they would be.

&#x200B;

Edit 6:  The 37 consecutive days are the shit splatters on an otherwise decent toilet. Let's try to clean it up without automatically assuming foul play. This is a thought exercise, **but I do not know if it holds true in the real world.**

In the post, I refer to ""The Shorts"" as a collective, but that's incorrect to assume. Not all shorts are making the same decisions or acting at the same day/time. We know that Failure to Deliver is measured as an aggregate, which is a net balance. If delivered are (+) and failed are (-) then we can figure out if a security failed to deliver by seeing if the net total is positive or negative (my understanding is that as retail we get the data as it becomes available rather than being able to measure it ourselves in real time). Within that net total, some actors will deliver their shares and some will fail to deliver. **Just because a security fails to deliver on the day doesn't mean every actor has failed to deliver. It just means the aggregate is net negative (for this example).** If this line of thinking is correct, it is possible that no individual actor has failed to deliver a threshold security for 13 consecutive days.

**Again, edit 6 is a thought exercise. Additional input, comments, criticism, and other lines of thinking are welcome.**

185,A,l2zk5e,2021-01-23 00:09:53,A hedge fund managers perspective on GME,"I am a hedge fund manager (long-short, derivative mixed equity fund primarily value focused with some growth). In the past we have been value holders of GME three other times and started a small position today nears it's intraday high and will likely add to this next week should the stock fall.   Previously all my Reddit comments have involved my e-Skate collection or my landing of my airplane in challenging conditions (see: [https://youtu.be/Rn7XoYKlZl0](https://youtu.be/Rn7XoYKlZl0)) However, I can't resist commenting on the fascinating technical factors that likely will continue to propel this issue higher - perhaps significantly so over the next few weeks.  Andrew Left's mocking derision of retail investors may prove to be his waterloo.  Why would a value focused fund manager buy a stock that based on classic fundamental value analysis appears significantly overvalued?  

GME appears to be a very interesting example of individual stock reflexivity.  What is reflexivity you ask?  This is the theory, originally promoted by George Soros that the stock market itself can cause the economy to either rise of fall (as opposed to the classic teaching that the economy affects the stock market).  An example of market reflexivity would be the great depression whereby a crashed market brought down an economy that was only in an ordinary recession, or the recent improvement in the economy, not withstanding Covid, which has followed a rising market.  In GME's case the rise in the stock price itself will likely result in fundamental improvements to the underlying economic metrics of the company.  Why?

1. As the price of the stock rises, GME finds itself in the enviable position where it can use it's stock at currency to buy complementary businesses it could not otherwise afford - monetization of the current short squeeze by the enterprise will lead to fundamentally higher revenue and profits of the enterprise should they find good strategic acquisitions to further monetize their large retail customer base (which has real and to date largely untapped value).  The company is likely right now on the hunt for a major acquisition that could fundamentally alter the companies future prospects with that acquisition largely paid for on the back of short seller covering.
2. Monetization of the short covering increase in share price via issue of a secondary .   The $500 million in debt (net of cash) the company currently has could be entirely extinguished with a secondary that is dilutive of only 10% of the equity base.  In fact such a secondary will, despite this dilution, likely result in a significant price rise for the stock (versus the usual fall in price after most, but not all, secondaries).  Bankruptcy risk will largely be eliminated with this secondary as will interest rate risk and financing costs ultimately increasing cash flow per share.  A 20% secondary will leave the company in a strong cash positive position with this cash available for expansion of sales efforts, cloud offerings, acquisitions, etc.
3. Directly increased sales and revenue by virtue of the large amount of attention this epic short squeeze has brought to the company.  I suspect most long retail stockholders have explored the companies web offerings and are considering becoming customers.  This is free advertising to people with money who are tech savvy and the exact demographic GME would target with paid advertising.  
4. Retention and efforts of existing management now becomes easy.  Every manager there wants to see this continue.  Operations at companies with sinking share prices typically suffer as management and employees leave the enterprise or develop anger and lassitude (think Sears Holdings).   The opposite is occurring here with every manager trying to beat their numbers to see the squeeze continue.
5. This issue remains extremely heavily shorted.  Despite the squeeze that has already occurred, other ""value"" based investors have dived into short positions as the price has risen.  The short positions of this issue appears (although I can't be certain) to exceed 100% with all available shares already lent out from marginal accounts and probably a lot of naked shorting going on as well.  Although I don't yet have the current data on todays short position, I can say for certain the stock remains very heavily shorter, perhaps more so now than at any previous time.  Today, I called my broker asking about the availability of shares to short and the borrow costs.  We have one of the larger accounts at our brokers firm and I was able to speak directly to the ""hard to borrow"" desk.  No borrowable shares are available at any broker, anywhere, at this time, even for high borrow costs or even from other brokers.  This extreme short against a small common float, made more extreme no-doubt by naked shorting, could end very poorly for those short this issue.  As they are forced to close out their positions, the stock will continue to rise and continue to exacerbate the positive effects the rising price has on the above 4 issues.

Impossible to know really where the stock goes from here as there does currently exist a disconnect from fundamentals. However, the extreme short position against the unrestricted common float here suggests to me there is a much greater chance of GME's price continuing to increase, perhaps significantly so, and this chance is far greater than the now fearful pundit in hiding's proclamation that the stock would soon see $20.

For what it's worth, over the past 13 years of this funds life, we have significantly beaten both the overall market and the dow,  (12.2%/year margin over DJIA inclusive of dividends since 2008).  We  have had plenty of losing issues despite this beat but also way more big winners, some really big.  Right now my money's with the retail investors who are long GME.  We only have a small position here but this may prove a big winner for us also.  Cheers.",Discussion,0.97

188,GME,lbv6iy,2021-02-03 20:00:11,GME Rollercoaster,"Listen up bag holders, 💎🖐, short bus riders.  

The euphoric feeling you had when you saw GME hit $500 intraday, with dreams of it hitting  $1,000 while yelling,”I’m gonna cooom!!” and the depression accompanying it when it hit $80 yesterday, while you glance at those big, heavy fucking bags in your diamond hands, are nothing new for GME gang. 

It happened in October when it was halted based on MSFT news and then promptly fell back down to earth.  It happened in November/December RC penned the letter to the BoD, run up to earnings where it dropped so hard after omnichannel.  Then RC made a filing to up his stake mid December.  We all know when he tweeted 🥜 around 1/15 opex week.   

After every major drop, GME or RC drops something to quell those doubts. Case in point, they announced 3 new hires today. 

Most of the GME DD prior to the squeeze was that the catalyst for the squeeze would most likely occur in late March/April.  I still stand by that.  

The run up to 1/15 and the subsequent para move was mainly driven by the incredible amount of GME options exp then and the gamma squeeze initiated by retail subsequently sustained by the larger hedge funds.  It always felt inorganic, which was why most current bag holders expected more.  Yes it could’ve reached $1000, 2000, 5000 even - had RH and other brokerages not royally fucked up and fucked every retail trader. Shorts may have covered through redemptions from ETFs with high concentrations of GME shares, they might have covered in other ways.  Who gives a shit.  The fact exists that there are still shorts.  We’ve learned and seen all the dirty tricks in the book thrown our way.  We now know what to be wary about.  We’re not missing our second shot.  
 
Short Squeeze has always been the cherry on top of the GME DD.   The DD was always that it was an undervalued company.  How undervalued is anyone’s guess.  

If restrictions get lifted, and volatility drops a bit, who’s to say gamma squeezes can’t happen again and ride the tendie train every Friday? We seen how TSLA went.  I understand two different industries, valuations, etc.? But gamma squeezes are real and both have asymmetric forward return profile. TSLA rode our FDs like a motherfucker to the moon all last yr. 

If you’ve lost money, you can cut your losses and do what is best for you and your family.  I’m not here to tell you to hold or sell or whatever you want to do with your money/financial decisions.  You can also hold to see how it will play out - you don’t lose if you don’t sell, because there are more catalysts to come (March earnings, 100M shelf offering, share buyback, expansion, LT roadmap).  Again, you do you. 

Just remember, for every high that GME has hit, it’s gone even higher than that in subsequent peaks.  I do think it will go higher than $500 at some point in the near future.  Gut feeling. Call me retarded. Call me crazy.  But that’s what everyone told me when I went in on GME in October.",Discussion,0.97

195,GME,lajjs2,2021-02-02 02:04:57,Almost 75% of all retail $GME orders were to buy (Fidelity). DONT BUY INTO THE FUD 🚀,"**FINAL EDIT**: There are critical support levels of retail buying points. Those are 143 (which was unbroken at the tie of writing), 68, and 38. 68 (8:10 - 8:25 AM today, Feb. 4 '21) has clearly broken as people closed off positions at breakeven and the flood gates down burst open. Another sell off between 10:00 & 10:15 AM coincided with another sell wall at 64-62. I think we'll make it all the way to 30-40 before it'll make sense to start buying long again (you saw what happened at 64-68; the same will likely happen at 34-38 but I don't know where the exact floor is).

The data has been showing, since the 140s, that retail isn't holding. ***The data presented as the cornerstone and namesake of this DD is no longer relevant***. The ratio of volume of shares per sell order relative to buy order appears to be higher than the ratio of buy orders to sell orders. In other words, there may be a 3:1 distribution of raw orders, but the sells are so much more packed that it breaks the ratio anyway. *The situation changed and as more data came to light, I now know I was wrong.*

*I used to be a HODLer* ***until the situation changed***. I lost out on a lot of profit by holding through waning evidence at the 300s, 200s, and 150s, and only pulled at 111—I was able to secure a little bit of profit to make this obsession a bit more worthwhile. At time of writing, the price is 52.60. Even with bullish conviction, this was still a directionally correct move as I can now buy double as much as I had before.

That being said, I think we're in for more downside, and I will not be buying back until we hit the bottom, wherever that may be. ***I'm still long-term bullish on the company transformation and will re-enter a moderately sized position after the volatility settles down.***

**Here's the original DD so you can see how I had brought up good data, but was directionally incorrect in my sprinkled analysis of it. Learn from this like I did, and you'll be more successful in the future.** Furthermore, I will not stop writing DDs because I think the data here is sound and makes sense. What was wrong was the analysis, which can happen to anyone with this many unknown variables. Future DD will take confirmation bias into account and will have higher probability of being on the money.

Today's most traded retail assets on Fidelity were $AMC & $GME.

And you know what people did? They bought a metric fuckton of shares. Contrary to what some of the Reddit Daily thread sentiment (which may or may not be bot-infested hell at this point) & news outlets claim, retail has seemingly not lost any interest in the stock and possibly prevented it from diving further.

Obligatory disclaimer: Mods, for the love of god please let this through it took a lot to write and I know for a fact it hasn't been discussed sufficiently / didn't get a dedicated post yet. Also, I'm a 🦍 and am not financial advisor and this isn't financial advice. This is a synthesis of public available information with autistic analysis like sprinkles on a birthday cupcake.

Disclaimer 2: I am extremely long $GME 🚀🌙

**UPDATE**: my stop loss got triggered and I am no longer long $GME until data changes. The information here has not changed, but the impact and its magnitude may have.

With that out of the way, I present to you,

# Exhibit A: Order Distribution

\~***75%*** of all $GME orders on Fidelity *today, on 2/1* were to *buy* the asset, rather than sell it. Each order can have however many shares.

[https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml)

That's just Fidelity. If you're able to check the order distribution on other brokers (like Vanguard or Schwab) please post it below and I'll update this post with your info. Usually this information is displayed on Top Traded Stocks or on the stock page itself under some tab.

There's more:

WeBull is showing a 45/55 distribution on the entire order book. Total Outflow (sells) was quoted at 1099, and total inflow at 996. While this may seem useless at first, consider this: the share price lost ***30***% today, but the order book is split ***45/55***, not ***35/65***. Just 10% of the outflow accounted for the 30% collapse in share price.

# Exhibit B: Volume

[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/)

Today's volume was half of the daily average. *Half of the daily average*. And while the price 30% movement may seem scary at first, trending down on low volume is actually a bullish sign. Courtesy of u/weedcomet:

""[https://finance.zacks.com/importance-price-changes-previous-day-stock-market-2906.html](https://finance.zacks.com/importance-price-changes-previous-day-stock-market-2906.html) 'After a strong-volume upward move, if the market moves sideways in conjunction with lower volume for several days in a row, it is a bullish sign indicating that all overhanging selling pressure has been relieved and any buying could spark a strong price rise.'""

In other words, flat or even *declining* on low volume often precedes 🚀 🚀 🌝. Literally any form of significant buying can move the price by a very high magnitude.

There's also been studies done on this phenomena, and correlation was established between sideways or negative movement on low volume and a subsequent increase in price. Feel free to research this on your own accord and post your findings below for all of us autists to read.

# Exhibit C: Why Retail Buying May Return Soon

I'm not a financial advisor, and even less so Nostradamus. I don't know when we'll be able to take advantage of this sideways movement to our benefit. What I do know is that that time is approaching. Considering two major events:

1. Transition from Robinhood & other affected brokers to mainstream solutions• This was likely started en masse on Thursday, before RH transfer restrictions kicked in. It takes 2-5 market days to transfer an account to another broker, and about the same for just slushing cash around. That means, a solid chunk of trades will be able to buy into the market beginning tomorrow and throughout the remaining week.• Many are also in the process of opening up new accounts. These were probably started en masse on Friday, when transfer restrictions prevented people from taking the plunge. A solid chunk of brokers need settlement time for instant deposits.- The instant deposits are capped, meaning whale accounts aren't able to kick in yet. Regular deposits takes 1-2 business days to clear. Beginning tomorrow, we'll start seeing larger retail accounts com online and regain their impact on price delta.
2. Robinhood bottleneck may or may not disappear this week. Robinhood just raised another $2.4 billion on top of their previous round, which is more than enough to clear DTC's collateral requirements. According to their own statements as of late, this was the primary reason why Robinhood restricted asset purchases in the first place. If you're willing to trust them on that, it means that we shall see a resurgence in volume from remaining Robinhood users in the coming days.

# Conclusions

Putting 1+2+3 together we get a potential recipe for another green EoW. Retail sentiment being positive can translate into higher volume once logistical bottlenecks are cleared and resume ass-ripping activities. HOWEVER, it is by NO MEANS guaranteed, and only the tippy top of the world know exactly what these mfs might pull off in the coming days. Get yourselves ready for either a positive or negative scenario this week / beginning of next.

GME to moon.

**ANOTHER EDIT:** Welcome to the end of the post. I’m proud of you for making it this far in literacy class. I want to respond to all of your comments and questions but automod deletes all but a couple of them. I’ll answer them as soon as they show up.

**UPDATE:** Ok automod deleted a bunch of negative feedback which is WRONG. Also some FAQs that got blocked. The questions were valid so here’s the best I could do:

1–Retail made no dent so what to expect now?

* I don’t know what to expect. What I do know is that retail made no dent because of the bottlenecks mentioned in Exhibit C above.

2–Should I buy now or what?

* I want you to make your own conclusion based on available evidence, not seek confirmation bias. I don’t want to be liable for your money and neither does anyone else.

3–Smart money is leaving and you’ll be left holding the bag

* I have yet to see credible evidence in either the trading volume, SEC reports, or formal announcements from any major institutional shareholder of GameStop that indicates they’re leaving. If you have this information please relay it to me (don’t use comments, you’ll get blocked by bot). BlackRock had to adjust due to internal requirements AFAIK correct me if I’m wrong
* **UPDATE**: this post shows that more instutitional shares flowed out than in. But, more funds bought in than exited. Make of that what you will. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laum38/for\_the\_scared\_little\_baby\_apestake\_a\_look\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laum38/for_the_scared_little_baby_apestake_a_look_for/)

4–AMC?

* I have no data on AMC. You should do your own research and make a thread like this.

5–When selling then?

* I have an emergency exit plan like everyone else should. I don’t have the financial capability to let GME go to 0. I’ll keep a small position post-exit just in case. Make an exit plan that aligns with what loss or gain you can stomach. Don’t invest more than you’re willing to lose. Nothing on this sub is financial advice. You don’t have to sell if you can lose everything. I’m probably liquidating my options and doing shares only until further trend confirmation.",DD,0.99
196,TLRY,kqd5w2,2021-01-04 18:21:12,$TLRY Will Be The First Moon Trip of 2021 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀,"&#x200B;

**Good Afternoon Retards.** Tilray (TLRY) has been having a nice start to 2021. This is only the beginning and there's still time for you to secure your first 10 bagger of 2021. 🚀

**Why TLRY?**

It's all in the fundamentals. TLRY got the better end, at least in the short term, of the merger deal with APHA. The premium APHA will pay per share in this reverse acquisition will be of great benefit to TLRY's balance sheet. Tilray's massive potential has now been coupled with strong fundamentals. When (Yes, WHEN not if) weed is legalized in the US, Tilray, a company registered in the US, has the foothold in the US that, when combined with APHA's resources and distribution, will be a DOMINANT force in the market. 🚀🚀🚀

Not only is Tilray in a good position to take over the US Cannabis market, but it also has a strong presence in Canada, where it is headquartered. The merger with APHA means TLRY will own 17.3% of the Canadian Cannabis market, **by far the largest** market share of any other Canadian Cannabis companies. 

**The US is a HUGE market to be tapped into🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Georgia Senate elections are **TOMORROW,** as of the writing of this post **BOTH** Democratic candidates are the betting favorites to win. **When this happens, the blue wave is complete and weed is all but legalized in the US.** A Democrat-controlled Senate was the last domino needed to fall. It is reasonable to believe that weed can and will be legalized in the US before the end of Q1 2021. 

Once weed is federally legalized, the market expands **EXPONETIALLY** in the US. Weed will become legal in large states such as New York. **Billions of dollars are just sitting that TLRY is in the best position to take** 

**TLRY is MASSIVELY undervalued🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

As of 12/31, TLRY is trading at a very attractive 4.23 \* book value. MorningStar gives TLRY a fair value of 14$ (As of 1/1/21). Only 1 of 18 analysts have given TLRY a sell rating.

**Wall Street is bullish on TLRY🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Since it has cooled down since the Biden rally, Tilray has consistently been reaching higher highs and higher lows. It is up around 6% at the time I'm writing this post. Put/Call Ratio is .1! Safe to say Wall Street is preparing for the Blue Wave and the legalization of weed, of which TLRY is in the best position to take advantage of the untapped US market.

209,GME,l76f74,2021-01-28 20:39:31,This is why you should HOLD Shares and BUY more GME regardless of current price or volatility,"For those new comers who dont understand what is going on with Gamestop. As you can see there are 69.75M outstanding shares of which 46.89M shares are float (meaning they are available on the market to trade, other shares are held by the GME corp, CEO etc). The Shares (short) as of Jan 14 2021 shows  61.78M shares short. Meaning when there are only 46.89M shares available on the market, the shorted shares are more than the available ones. They need your shares to get out of their short positions. They have shorted more shares then the number of shares which exist. If you people HOLD or BUY more shares, the higher the value goes once the squeeze happens (When their short contracts expire, they would have to buy. If there are no shares to buy, the price goes to the Moon and beyond because of simple demand and supply. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Today was a ladder attack which showed very low volume when the stock was halted. It was there to scare off investors. Everyone should keep their shares held to themselves and buy more at any given price. May Gamestop be the most valuable company for a while on the squeeze just like Volkswagen did back in 2008.

&#x200B;

P.S ignore people who are buying BB, AMC, NOK because they think there may be a squeeze with those companies too or think they are too late to jump into GME squeeze. Remember, the squeeze will happen eventually. Volkswagen squeeze took almost 2 years, but GME will be wayyyy quicker because of the spread of the news and the sheer amount of people jumping in.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Buy GME in any way or HOLD it if you cant buy more.

&#x200B;

P.S: This is not financial advice. I LIKE THE STOCK THATS WHY I AM BUYING IT.

https://valueofgrowth.com/recent-posts/f/the-3-best-stocks-to-watch-in-2021-with-huge-upside?blogcategory=stocks

**Summary**
TLDR version: Cloud/email/data security. Huge growth, recent acquisition, fair value estimate showing ~50% upside, earnings in 2 weeks at which point the fair value will likely increase even further as the recurring revenues from acquisitions and the continued growth push the data averages higher. 

**Positions**
Call volume for March-May expirys have been spiking, so that's where I'm at. Since the fair value is over $12, I'm buying $11 and $12 strikes.

224,BUY,l9ksh1,2021-01-31 21:11:20,DO NOT BUY SILVER!,"Do not try to buy precious metals in the next week while China is celebrating the beginning of their Year of the Metal Ox. Wait until after you are done holding GME, even though you are planning to hold GME forever.

Anything other than GME is a distraction. Since you are holding GME forever, you are never allowed to invest in anything else ever again. Holding GME is your life's work and requires your undivided attention. There is no possible way anyone would ever talk about anything other than GME unless they wanted you to sell GME. Even when it's a weekend and you can't sell GME anyway.

All of your money should be in your brokerage so you shouldn't even have any money available to buy bullion with. Your brokerage would never betray you. 

Don't think anything of the fact that online bullion dealers have frozen your ability to buy silver. The statements on their front pages saying they have to restrict your purchase ability due to unprecedented market conditions are nothing like any other statements you've seen from anyone recently. Don't think about it. 

The US dollar will never lose value again. Biden is going to make an announcement tomorrow that the federal reserve will burn a pile of money to reverse inflation, I can feel it. Hedging against this is something you would only do if you're shilling for a hedge fund. That's why they're called hedgies. 

Pay no attention to the mass downvotes and accusations of shilling to everyone suggesting silver. The ruling class would never seed a meme about silver being a distraction to divide the community from adding another major step to their plan.

Pay no attention to how major banks have sold 200x more silver than they actually have and if they're called to deliver on all those receipts instead of people continuing to be happy to just hold paper receipts they could *hypothetically* exchange, then... well, like I said, no matter.

The important thing is to spend your weekend wondering what will happen to GME while there is no action you can take on it. Don't focus on anything you could take action right now.

Don't sort comments by new. You don't want to see the unfiltered stream of consciousness of the subreddit, just stick to the carefully curated, vote-and-award-manipulated ranking of what everyone can agree on. We don't have any stickied threads sorted by new today because the people in charge here have your best interests at heart and they don't want you to get into trouble buying any silver. They're not like that other guy who tried to sell out the community, shame on him. Since they're not sellouts, there's no way they could ever make a mistake or allow the community to be misguided. Trust in them and blindly follow the subreddit's general direction at all times.

And most importantly, don't forget, you're very small. Silver has a market cap of $1.4 trillion. Big banks and governments have a vested interest in it. Don't you dare think your little wallets could possibly tip the scales of something this big going on right in front of you. Just take your tendies and quit while you're ahead, and don't think too much about where this is all leading next.

235,A,lb6n2f,2021-02-02 22:16:21,How To Avoid A FOMO Buy In 10 Steps,"This checklist might save your day or at least save you some dollars. 

You might think that you would never FOMO into a stock or you might be wondering if this applies to you. Ask yourself these questions to find out if you need the checklist. 

- Have you ever thought of buying some super hyped shares at ATH?

- Have you thought about joining ‘the team’ in the squeeze on stockthatshallnotbenamed? (Ps. there are no teams in retail investing it’s every man for himself)

- Do you use WallStreetBets? 

If you answered yes to any of the precursor questions below then you are in danger of a FOMO trade and need this checklist. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
HOW NOT TO FOMO CHECKLIST 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Ask yourself why you want to buy the stock. Are you jealous of others gains? Do you want to be part of that weeks big thing? If yes to either then do not buy. Jealous trading is bad trading. 

2. Warren Buffet said “be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy.” Ask yourself if people are being greedy with the stock you want to buy, do not buy if they are. 

3. Ask yourself “am I being a sheep?” Sheep do not make money on the stock market, they don’t even understand the stock market, they are sheep. Don’t be a sheep. 

4. Where did you see the stock? If it was on the news don’t buy it. If it’s trending on one of the subreddits then it’s probably too late. 

5. Is it often appearing on the subreddit and being regularly pushed by the same small crowd? Watch out cause without proof they are probably bag holders hoping to pass the bag to you. 

6. Can you explain to somebody what the company does and why it is a good idea to buy it? If not then you shouldn’t buy it yourself. 

7. Is the market mostly red or mostly green that week? Sell on green weeks and buy on red weeks. It might feel like the other way around at the time but that’s emotional trading. 
8. Is it a meme stock? If yes then be an early adopter or don’t adopt at all. 

9. Have you got spare capital? If money is no issue to you or if you are making a small punt that won’t harm your finances then go ahead. If you are making a big, late move into a meme stock then you’ll be seeing red. 

10. Does it have emojis in the DD’s? If yes then disregard all previous steps and bet your house on it.",DD,0.82

THIS ADVICE IS FOR NEW BUYERS ONLY OR FOR THOSE WHO HOLD MORE THAN 5 SHARES IN RH AND WANT TO BUY MORE. ANYONE BOUGHT ON RH, DISABLE STOP LIMIT. DISABLE MARGIN, AND HOLD ON CASH.**

Lets get this shit out of the way right now. The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.

So here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...

🚀🚀Fidelity and Vanguard🚀🚀. You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.

This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this.

**TLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. They will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.**

TL;DR: WHEN THE SHORTS CLOSING AT A LOW PRICE THEY NEED TO BUY BACK, RESULTING IN THE ACTUAL MOON SQUEEZE IS WHAT THEY SAYING.

&#x200B;

WHAT CHANGED SINCE FRIDAY HERE AND WHAT NOT I AM ASKING MYSELF. SO LETS COUNT BANANAS:

I checked daily the [https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today)

&#x200B;

On Friday (market closed) we had: 

SHORT INTEREST    68,13M 

SHARES SHORT       97,685%

DAY TO COVER         6,31

&#x200B;

Right now  February 3, 2021 we have the following data:

SHORT INTEREST    61,78M <-----------  DOWN 6,35M

SHARES SHORT       88,58% <------------  DOWN 9,105%

DAY TO COVER         2,81     <------------  DOWN 3,5 Days

&#x200B;

You may now say that the values haven't changed that much, or in a reasonable way and still GME is rank #1 worldwide for the most amount of %Share Shorts AND still have 2,81 Days to cover the shorts.

His girlfriend was deeply asleep next to him. She had come home late again last night after hanging out with Jake, the guy she jokingly called her boyfriend.

When GME goes to the moon and I get my tendies, she’s going to love me again!

His phone vibrated loudly on the nightstand next to him.
“I’m outside,” the text preview said. Fuck!

His brother, Charles, was outside. He had completely forgotten about the family brunch - a long-standing tradition that was usually a monthly occurrence. The pandemic had pushed their brunch plans and it had now been six months since their last reunion.

He clumsily climbed out of bed. He found his jeans from last night on the floor and jumped into them. They were the only jeans that still fit him. The lightly colored denim was starting to fade. He picked a black tee shirt that was loose enough to hide his pandemic gut. It had deodorant stains, so he knew his arms would be glued his sides all day.

He watered his thinning hair. He sprinted back into the bedroom.

“Bye, baby! I’ll see you after my family brunch.""
He leaned in to kiss her cheek but she, annoyed, dug her head deeper into the pillow so that she could keep sleeping.
He gulped at the purple bruise with teeth marks on the side of her neck.

The black Model S was sparkling in the sun. Their father bought it for Charles as a reward for getting accepted into the same neurosurgery fellowship their father trained at.
“That’s what you’re wearing?” Charles laughed.
“Ha ha yeah my other clothes are in the wash.”

His brothers biceps were bulging through the expensive shirt he was wearing. A water bottle condensed onto the cup holders. Charles was the family prodigy and exuded confidence in every step.

The drive to their parents house consisted of shallow catch-up small talk. He kept his hands on his laps the entire time in order to hide the Dorito stains on them.

                          -----   

“What the fuck do you mean you’re out of money, Dale?!” His father bellowed.
Images of $5,000 of expired PLTR YOLO calls came to mind.
If I had picked the expiration date for two weeks later, I’d be rich right now...
The other $5,000 his father gave him went into GameStop stock. He bought at the top, which was $350 dollars per share. It was now sitting at $80 per share.

They said I’d make tendies! They said it was free fucking money. There’s no way it could’ve gone tits up. Diamond hands prevai-

“Did you spend it all on the fucking stock market again?”
There’s no way out. I’m fucked. I don’t have any money. I need to tell him.

“Yes.”
“WHAT THE FUCK! You fucking degenerate!”
Charles was snickering next to him with his cell phone aimed at Dale. He was recording him. Susan, their sister, was blushing and looking at her phone. Their mother was embarrassed and looked worried.

Don’t give Charles a satisfying reaction. Stay cool. Diamond hands, baby.

""Dad. It's different this time! The shorts are ladder trading right now which is artificially bringing the price down. Plus, the short squeeze is coming any day now!""

He had no idea what ladder trading was. A user named u/PM_Me_Vagina_pics wrote that in a thread he saw earlier. Dale didn't even understand what a short squeeze was or how it worked. He barely grasped what puts and calls were and that's because Robinhood made it easy to do.

""You think you can beat billionaires at their own game?"" his dad hissed through clenched teeth. His jugular vein was bulging. Or was that his carotid vein?
I'll ask Charles later! He'll know.

""Yes! If we all hold on to our stock there is no way tha-""

“FUCK!”
His dad pounded his fists and left the table.

It wasn't even 11 AM and Dale had already ruined the day. Mother was mortified. Susan was scarlet. And Charles was chortling.

Most men would fold under the deep shame of being called a degenerate by their father. But Dale was not like most men. He took a bite of his blueberry waffles and pretended they were chicken tenders.
Yummy!

A small fire was alive inside of Dale. The spark of that flame came from a meme that made him giggle earlier. In the meme, there was a picture of a chimp. Or perhaps it was an ape? It was the caption, however, that captivated Dale and gave him the confidence to buy 500 more dollars worth of Gamestop stock. The caption read:

267,GME,lc0oof,2021-02-03 23:50:34,Part 4 - $BB No Meems (plus $GME $AMC $NOK) - Ties that Bind,"  

Welcome to the continuation of this incoherent tirade. [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamg0y/bb_dd_no_meems_part_1/)  [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamill/bb_dd_no_meems_part_2/)  [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb4e2m/part_3_bb_dd_no_meems_fuck_the_memes/) linked. 

$BB went up today. Is that good for $BB investors & bagholders? Yes, you grunt, drooling onto your weighted blanket. But axchuaallly…..shit I don’t know I’m just a retard but I think the answer is sort of, only maybe. 

I updated my chart from yesterday. As we in the $BB gang already know, $BB's a [steady eddy space shuttle headed to mar](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamg0y/bb_dd_no_meems_part_1/)s. If you even look @ the price anymore you're a puss looking at prices are for paper hands. 

But look at this fucking thing. 

&#x200B;

[Live by $BANG, Die by $BANG](https://preview.redd.it/qyd7aorh8cf61.png?width=546&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ffa10ba469718f6939f3eb9f85288d3ead95bae)

**Look at the correlation.** For the smooth brains – you might think yeah no shit those are the most common tickers on reddit so what. 

So WHatt??? This is a weird thing!!!! **There is no** ***fundamental*** **(yes many of you don't have that word in your vocab idc bite me) reason** for these stocks to trade tegoether. *Why the fuck would an Endpoint security company, a vidya retailer, a movie chain, and some Fininsh 5(g) provider trade in tandem other than just being meme stocks?* 

Re: the downwards movement, my hypothesis was [degrossing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-30/a-reddit-army-descends-on-hedge-funds-chained-by-risk-models?sref=NJllTNWZ)  / [margin calls on retail account](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamill/bb_dd_no_meems_part_2/)s - $BANG was the most commonly held basket in RobinHood accounts this past few weeks and dips get exacerbated by margin calls .

But….....what goes down must also go up. Said another way – What’s causing correlation on the upswings as well? **Why would buyers of $BB today also be buying a*****, a vidya retailer, a movie chain, and some Fininsh 5(g) provider****,* especially after the loss porn of the past few days? **And especially since the front page has been dominated almost entirely by $GME / $AMC ?** 

*BTW the reason some of the $BB GANG want a conscious decoupling (it's not you...it's us) from the memes (fuck the memes) is so that people can realize the true fundamental value of Papa Chen’s Cyber Co. vs. the continual austistic screeching about Janet Yellin and Melvin (newsflash Melvin got the fuck out already)*

Anyways – So the question is sure, initially some retards bought the whole $BANG before $GME blasted off, but why is that still holding true? My theory, having a number of acquaintances @ hedge funds (no none of them Melvin fuck you)  is - yesit’s WSB’s favoriate bogeyman - those very same hedge funds. 

As [Chamath so eloquently described](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/chamath-palihapitiya-closes-gamestop-position-but-defends-individual-investors-right-to.html) as he verbally tore CNBC a new asshoe, hedgies may wear infinitely finer suits and sport cleaner underwear but they chase the very same tendies. The dirty little scecret is a big part of what they do is **momentum chasing** – Buying what goes up and selling what goes down. 

Those initial shackles binding $BANG were the idiots here (including me) who bought $BANG in various combinations. But now those shackles are wrapped in **$BILLIONS$** of load-bearing momentum strategies. Long shorts funds. Market neutral funds. And, perhaps ***most hilariously***, the [black box quant strategies](https://www.ft.com/content/81811f27-4a8f-4941-99b3-2762cae76542) with Harvard PhD-designed models that probably – accidentally - now have a meme basket that they trade, punting on shares of $BB, $NOK, $AMC, and $GME like the most retarded amongst us. 

# TLDR – I LIKE $BB MID AND LONG TERM, AND EVENTUALLY IT NEEDS TO DECOUPLE FROM $BANG TO ACHIEVE TRUE GREATNESS. BUT IN THE SHORT TERM I AM PRAYING TO CHEETO JESUS FOR YOU $GME / $AMC /$NOK BROTHERS – FOR BETTER OR WORSE WE'RE ALL BONDED TIGHER THAN [VLAD'S CLENCHED BUTTHOLE.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-calls-robinhood-ceo-vlad-the-stock-impaler-and-grills-him-over-the-gamestop-saga-11612180184)

*PS If I were less of a retard I might try to design an option spread to take advantage of the (1) $BANG correlation and (2) the fact that $BB and $NOK swings are more muted. There’s $$$ to be made there I think some of you smart options monkeys figure that one out. Other interesting ways to make $$$* *- Betting on what tickers (Tootsie roll gang anyone? Fuck that one lost me a lot of $$) become meme stocks and drop out of being a meme stock*

&#x200B;

GME has only about 65 million shares available in the market (free-float), that means, you can trade an unlimited amount with derivatives like CFDs, but there's a real scarcity on the main asset, in this case the stock.

&#x200B;

We are about 6 million users here, this means that, if each user buys 10 stocks of GME, more than the 85% of the free float shares are going to be assigned, and in this case, it's going to create a problem for closing short-selling positions, since the users are going to be determining the final price to buy again the stock in order to close the trade. (Remember, scarcity is the word here.)

&#x200B;

Don't you know what this means? I'm not telling to hoard the market and manipulate the order-book, but do the mental math. WALL STREET BETS WON, we are going to be the ones deciding when this craze is going to end, and this is a victory for retail traders, if we want, we could sweep the market.

Just because they wear suits and drink expensive coffee does not make them any smarter than you or I.  The only thing they have is more money.  But lucky for us, as the 69th law of thermodynamics states, GME shares cannot be created or destroyed.  This means no amount of money can destroy GME shares, and no amount of money can create them.  This is ofcourse, unlike the diamond industry which is controlled.  Diamonds can be created in labs and there are far more diamonds in the world than are in circulation.   This means we have unlimited potential for 💎🙌.  We need to realize that the power to have 💎🙌 is within all of us.  And that we all evolved from 🐒 (who were here when the first diamonds were being made) into 🦍 .  These hedge funds and/or Market makers are infantile compared to our diamond handed evolutionary traits.  They are so dumb that they haven't realized the one simple truth:  We aren't fucking selling.  Let these clowns drive the price lower.  I implore them.  The damage has already been done and at the end of all this they will have doubled down on their short so many times that Gamestop will have to issue a class retard share that these shorts are forced to buy and pay to hold until they can close their original short position or for life.

TL:DR 
Diamonds are forever
Short positions require interest payments

AMC and GME are now historic, household names. Buffett didn't sell AAPL as shares climbed and climbed. He accumulated more every time public faith in the company wavered.


There is no price target for me. I will hold these shares until someone pries them from my cold, dead 💎👐.

TIME is the enemy of Wall Street. They’re running like a chicken with no head. They have to COVER and pay INTEREST!!

AS LONG AS YOU HOLD AND DONT SELL, those big dips are NOT REALIZED LOSSES! They’re just psychological losses to make you DOUBT AND SELL!

Brokers restricting PURCHASE of these stocks is creating an UNFAIR ratio of SUPPLY and due to the restriction of stock it creates a LOW DEMAND! Therefore when there’s a big supply and low demand is when the stock price goes down. However, there is A LOT OF DEMAND and that’s why they’re playing DIRTY and restricted purchase to CREATE A FAKE LOW DEMAND! That’s why there are lawsuits. 

1) HOLD AND BUY THE DIPS

2) DONT LET WALL STREET BULLY YOU

3) AS DAY PASSES WALL STREET CONTINUE TO BLEED since they have to cover and pay interest

4)HOLD AND BUY🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕

5)REMOVE YOUR STOP LOSSES❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️

6) SET LIMIT AS HIGH AS YIU CAN

7) DO NOT LOCK IN GAINS because you want to BUY DIPS. With the restriction, this strategy is not plausible

8) AMC/GME ruled out bankruptcy so your stock won’t be $0

9) DOUBLE CHECK any news or analyst or posts as they may try to scare you with fake facts. Do your own DD

10) think positive of the BIG REWARD. You CANT lose more than your total investment but  GAINS ARE LIMITLESS and this is what’s SCARING wallstreet.

317,ARE,l92ma1,2021-01-31 03:46:35,JPM &amp; CITADEL AND HOW SLV IS CONNECTED. MAJOR SCHEME THAT WAS PLANNED AND HERE IS HOW YOU ARE GETTING PLAYED,"What’s good newcomers, OG’s, Millennials, Boomers, boys, girls, 🦍, 🍉 and former 🥭 tweet enjoyers.


**OBLIGATORY - $GME🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 (YES THAT IS 7 ROCKET EMOJIS SO YOU KNOW IM DAMN SERIOUS).**

It’s ya boy here, ElJefe and boyyyyyy do I have something to share with you!

Hold onto your seats, because what I’m about to share IS a doozy and it might help make a lot of connections with what the fuck is going on related to this whole GME fiasco, that is now turning into some chance opportunity for $SLV to return to the main stage as another **“squeeze opportunity”.**

Listen we all should know by now that the news we are shown is mostly used to control a narrative for a certain group and this is **NO DIFFERENT OF A TIME**.  The thing that is so unique with this situation is how intertwined things are more than you are lead to believe. 

Does anyone find it amazing that 1 company Robinhood) was able capture the attention of millions upon millions of NEW retail investors by simply creating an app that is understandable and is easy to use? Think of it, Robinhood opened the door to change people’s lives by guiding them through the transaction process for stocks and people started to open their eyes and realize that making money to sustain your life doesn’t need to take a whole bunch of your time away from you. 

So here is where the story begins.

Robinhood as many of you know was **heavily** funded by a Market Maker that is known as Citadel (previously Wellington management, which was founded in 1933 by Walter L. **Morgan**(weird coincidence, but maybe popular name in the day 🙃) as the first balanced mutual fund).

Citadel not only is a market maker, but they also are the providers of a certain component of the transaction process known as immediate or cancel interface. Check out “Citadel Connect” - which essentially is known for the immediate or cancel interface that is baked directly into the transaction process for Brokerages. So they have their hand in a lot of cookie jars across brokerages, to say the least. They also provide a system of algorithmic trading that helps automatic trading for their clients and more! Check out their website, it is eye opening the power this single company really has over the exchange. 

Now keep in mind from before, Citadel gave Robinhood a **SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY** to get them going because they saw a huge opportunity with having **MORE** retail traders joining the party and that opportunity was **DATA**. Citadel has instant and live trading data access to every single trade you make (hence why you usually notice an immediate opposing force from the stock you are buying - buy call and stock goes down right away, buy put and stock goes up right away), this is not something you are imagining, Citadels algorithm is literally taking this data in real time, and placing the most favorable trade for Citadel, which usually starts mind fucking you with your position right off the bat. Remember emotional trading will always lose, and they fuck with your emotions IMMEDIATELY (usually).

So Robinhood —> Citadel.

Next is JP Morgan. The banker. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait up. A *Morgan* started the original Citadel (Wellington), remember? Seems like a killer coincidence! Is Walter somehow related to John Pierpont? Even if indirectly, they bare the same family name... hmmm weird, but I can’t seem to find any relation on good old Google! So we’ll leave this just as a coincidence. 

Back to JP Morgan - they would be the next in line to pay up or default and they are fully aware of the immensity of an infinite squeeze and now are in a position where they would be ones losing huge amounts of money. They have a lot of smart people working for them that quickly caught onto this and starting creating a contingency plan of some kind of to recoup some of the losses they are about to experience.

**This is where $SLV/Silver comes into play and WHY YOU ARE SEEING IT POP UP MORE FREQUENTLY.**

For those who unaware, $SLV is the ishares Silver Trust (which is blackrock’s silver etf). The silver squeeze **IS** something to have happened before and guess who was able to benefit **SIGNIFICANTLY** off of the sell off of the last $SLV rally... JP Morgan. How’d they do this? **They shorted the fuck out of it.** Check out JP Morgan’s history with the precious metals market - https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/09/29/jp-morgan-settles-spoofing-lawsuit-alleging-fraud-in-metals-trades.html. They paid, but still made out like bandits with profits. 

Weird how when JP Morgan is about to lose a metric fuck ton of money, $SLV all of a sudden becomes “viral” and we start seeing it popping up everywhere as the “next squeeze”, but maybe just a coincidence, right? 

Recap Robinhood —> Citadel —> JP Morgan would be the defaulted order. JP Morgan will need to recoup losses somehow, and what better way then A short on Silver whilst writing options during the run up?

Hence why $SLV has became viral.

So in essence. Stay the fuck away from Silver stocks unless you really know what you’re doing. Our mission is to focus on 💎🤲🏻ing GME. **EVERYTHING ELSE THAT IS BEING** ***SHILLED*** **IS A DISTRACTION**. 



Also, Citadel should be another entity we are burning at the stake, not just Robinhood. Citadel is pulling off the greatest heist in history and the rest of the hedgies are just benefiting from this fiasco.

TLDR:  HOLD GME IT IS A REALLY GREAT STOCK , SLV IS DISTRACTION (at least during this), BUY TANGIBLE SILVER.

318,GME,l882je,2021-01-30 00:42:15,~100% GME shares held by institutions. Still over 100% of the float is short. WE'RE THE CAPTAIN NOW,"So I was doing some perusing and wondered, ""How much of GME float do institutions own?"" According to several sources its around 100%. Yahoo finance has it at 122%. Finviz has it at 95%. And Nasdaq has it at 110%.

([https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME))

([https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME))

([https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/institutional-holdings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/institutional-holdings))

Now I know what your smooth brain is telling you. ""How can it be over 100%?"". Well it can be for two main reasons. The first is differences in when companies report their holdings to the SEC, not everyone reports on the same day. The other reason is due to short selling. If institution A has their shares shorted to institution B, then both technically own stock in the company but its being counted twice when reported to the SEC. 

The other question on everyone's mind is, ""How much of the float is still short?"". According S3 Partners market data, after the close today we're still at 113%!!!

([https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755?s=20](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755?s=20))

So how does this all unfold? We've got an army of retards who won't sell for less than $69,420.00, what seems like almost 100% of the float owned by big institutions that can't sell their position all at once  (it's possible they've started selling some of their shares), and still over 100% of the float is short. I really have no idea but it seems like at this point no one who owns a share should have to sell at a loss.

**TL;DR: over 100% of GME float is held by institutions or retards who aren't gonna sell and there is still over 100% of the float being shorted. Flow just handed us the fucking Name Your Price Tool**

319,FOR,l80xaf,2021-01-29 20:01:20,HOLD ON TO YOUR COCONUTS- AN ANALOGY OF GME BEAR RAIDS FOR IDIOTS 🌴 🥥 🥥,"You live on and island with 11 coconuts (GME shares). No one likes them as much as you. There are 2 other douches, Melvie and his friend Hedgy. 

Melvie promised the baddest motherfucker on the island he’d give him 14 coconuts (139% short interest).

I’m the meantime, you gathered up 10 coconuts into a bag. MELVIN wants your coconuts bad, or else that mean motherfucker he promised them to will bash his brains in, then throw half his body into a volcano and feed the other half to a shark.

So Melvin and Hedgy want to buy your coconuts from you. It cost you $1 a coconut to get them. 

HERE’S THE BEAR RAID:
So Melvin and Hedgy pass the one 🥥 they have back and forth and say “here, have this for 90 cents”, then “no you take it for 80 cents” all the way down to a penny. Then they turn to look at you, fear in their eyes and piss in their pants and say “see, these are only worth a penny”, praying desperately to whatever god they believe in that you’ll buy it.

ARE YOU BUYING THAT SHIT? 

**NO BECAUSE YOU AREN’T A SUCKER AND YOU HAVE DIAMOND HANDS. AND YOU KNOW YOU CAN CHARGE WHATEVER THE FUCK YOU WANT FOR THOSE THINGS OR ELSE MELVIE IS DONE FOR.**

That’s the bear raid. That’s it. It’s the last price it traded for on low volume. Don’t believe it. It’s the only trick they have and it used to work, but not anymore now that millions of us can communicate and know what’s going on. They think we are so fucking stupid short interest is still over 100% today.

But You know for a fucking fact they have to deliver. 

Shorting costs money. Margin interest isn’t free, and margin gets called and puts expire worthless. Holding your hairy coconuts is free. All you have to do is nothing and they will bleed money until they are forced to pay whatever you want, or they go bust.

Don’t sell your coconuts.",Discussion,0.99

332,NOK,l4x1yx,2021-01-25 21:43:34,$NOK Next stock to blow,"&lt;TL:DR at bottom if you can't read&gt;

This is why Nokia will boom in 2021. Like $BB, it is no longer a phone company, but is now a major contender in 5G, autonomous driving, AI tech and cyber security. In fact, it almost sounds like a better blackberry with more upside potential. $NOK is trading at $4.75 at the time of writing. It saw a steady decline since it's previous high of $5 in August of 2020, but has since recovered in the last 4 months. 

The reason for the initial selloff was a corporate decision to cut jobs to free up cashflow for large projects going forward. At this time they also halted dividends which pissed off some older retirees, as expected. Now here is the various reason this stock can deliver massive returns in the next 12-36 months.

**Selected for U.S. Federal 5G Security Project**

The project is to ensure a secure transition from 4G to 5G because of the various risks perceived by the general public, to whom security comes above all else. Nokia will provide both software and hardware solutions, and work with both NCCoE and Government to implement.

**Nokia wins Belgian 5G contracts as Huawei ousted**

To put it short, Nokia was chosen to implement 5G technology in Belgium as US continued to put pressure on literally everyone to end business with Huawei over potential security threats.

**5 Year Deal with T-Mobile**

T-Mobile will be using Nokia's Airscale Radio Platform to scale up 5G deployment. As well as this, Nokia will personally facilitate T-Mobiles upgrade from LTE to 5G, which is by all means a large project

**Partnership with Google Cloud**

Googles cloud computing services will be working together with Nokia to help businesses transform their network connectivity through the implementation of 5G and new cloud capabilities.

**Contract Secured with Tele2 in Sweden**

The amount has not been disclosed but it involves deploying 5G infrastructure for Tele2 subscribers in Sweden, to improve network performance and security. They will also use Nokia's NetAct Cloud Management system to improve management and security of sensitive subscriber data.

**Partnership with M1 to build Singapore 5G Ecosystem**

Together with M1, Nokia will implement their 5G standalone core to deliver advanced network capabilities to Singapore. The 5G Standalone core tech allows operators to design and automate network slices to further development of unmanned aerial or road vehicles, remote operations, wireless e-health, etc...

TL:DR

Nokia is not a phone Company. Major contender in the 5G space, cybersecurity AND AI autonomous vehicle operation. Partnerships with other large companies in both the US and abroad have set the stage for NOKIA to dominate 5G, which has the potential to see more growth than any other industry in 2021. Also have more upside potential as Huawei continues to lose contracts due to US pressure and potential security threats.

372,GME,l8m1oj,2021-01-30 14:48:14,GME Shorts Will Try to Buy From Longs Over Weekend - Discuss,"Good morning retards. 

I've broken out my robe, my pipe, and my helmet so that we can sit down and contemplate the most singular and engaging question of our time:

> If you were a short what would you do if you were SUPER fucked but you knew in two days you were going to be SUPER DUPER fucked? 

That's the question that we're faced with this fine Saturday morning. But let's do a quick review of the facts to understand where the shorts are possibly at before trying to answer that one.

**Current short situation**

* According to the DD floating around here we're still at 100% short interest - at least.
* Melvin and Shitron say they're out of their positions. But are they? 
* Doesn't matter. New shorts are still short and will be forced to cover. 
* We saw liquidity dry up Friday with a bid ask gap of like thousands at one point
* Shorts launched multiple short ladder attacks
* Reports of whales coming in an buying up the shorts shares during the attacks, short can't keep that up
* If shorts can't short attack because of the whales hoovering up their shares, what can they do? They have to buy eventually.
* ~~Oh and then there's the big gamma squeeze coming from Friday.~~ Ok looks like the gamma squeeze may have occurred [already](https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8e9f3/read_this_if_you_expected_a_huge_gamma_squeeze/). Thanks to /u/BlueEstee for that DD - they definitely have more wrinkles on their lobes than me!
*~~All call contracts expired ITM Friday. Any naked calls must be covered. More importantly - MMs will be forced to gamma hedge existing contracts for further out expiration. They do this by buying shares.~~
* Retail is now buying out of spite. Which is the best kind of investing I think.
* I chew crayons. I put that together from what's here. If I did you know the shorts brokers did as well. Margin requirement increase anyone?

tl;dr shorts current situation

> They are SUPER DUPER fucked early next week because of the incoming gamma squeeze, likely increasing margin requirements, whales getting involved and of course continued retail interest.

Much of this is a summation of DD by /u/jkn_ku so read their post if you want a REALLY good blow-by-blow of Friday with some really keen insights on order flow sniping and things I had no fucking clue about: [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l7qlfh/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity_pt_3/).  I know, I know, /r/investing but goddamn if that isn't some killer DD and it reads like a fucking action thriller. Respect.

**But what's the shorts next move?**

The shorts have had a lot of tactics to scare off retail - ladder attacks, PR blitzs, lots of bots, etc. But they have ONLY ever had one move - the move they HAVE to make eventually. And that's of course to buy back the shares they owe their brokers. They're under contact to do so - it's the law.

But that's what will cause the MOASS and force them to buy from retail, right? That's what we want?

Yes! But there are other longs out there other than retail - institutional longs. These are usually big companies or funds who purchase gme for long term strategies. We haven't talked that much about them.

Here's a list and the amount of shares they own from an Investors.com [article](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/gme-stock-gamestop-investors-instantly-make-16-billion-gamestop-stock-squeeze/).

I want to be clear. Longs only represent 51.m shares. And many of these are funds that probably cannot sell due to their fund balancing requirements and what not (I don't know - just guessing there). 

Shorts are shorts AT LEAST 100% according to all of the DD we've read. They still have to buy ALL of retails shares. There is no way that I can see for them to avoid doing so. But they WILL try to lessen the pain. 

And these institutional longs are seeing BILLIONS in gains (with a B) so who knows what could happen.

So I am speculating that the shorts will approach institutional longs over the weekend for some sort of deal. So keep your eyes and ears open and helmets strapped on tight!

This is not investment advice. Don't take investment advice from the internet.

EDIT: Thanks everyone for the awards but please save your $ for gme shares. 

EDIT2: For those of you doubting the willingness of Longs to sell NOW to avoid more volatility, consider that a large gme shareholder - MUST - sold off their entire stake this [week](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/large-gamestop-shareholder-must-asset-management-sold-off-its-stake-2021-01-28).

What a week in steel with some **BIG MOVES.**

Then came this morning. . .people panicked and paper hands sold.

As I said this morning, be patient and hold - it had gotten too hot too fast and we were due for a cool off, however I said - **THIS IS YOUR BUYING OPPORTUNITY!**

**BUY THE DIP!**

$CMC was downgraded today to HOLD by Deutsche and then it dumped.

They then upgrade $X and it moons.

Upgrades are great, but you have to take downgrades with a grain of salt, especially by a bank that is upgrading a competing US steel stock on the same day. . .what are they holding?  What do they want to buy?

It smells a little suspect, but that's why you do your own research.

Anyhow, on to the real news of the day that reversed the market and that was Biden's press conference and he laid out that he would be announcing his economic package next week.

 ""Biden is also likely to push for a larger legislative effort later in 2021 after the initial stimulus package. **That effort is expected to focus on spending trillions of dollars on infrastructure** and clean-energy jobs.""

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/01/08/biden-stimulus-plan/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/01/08/biden-stimulus-plan/)

The market instantly reversed and steel started recovering, quickly and by the AH action, I believe we are **PRIMED FOR A BIG WEEK COME MONDAY.**

What really stood out to me today was this as well:

Everyone that has read my posts know **$MT is my favorite play.**

The doubters in the beginning (and still - I do get your DM's - lots of angry people out there!) said this was a pump and dump.

$MT popped and then went sideways for a week or so - I said to wait and be patient.

That patience has started to come to fruition.

These increases are immediate and will be taken and like Oliver Twist - customers will say, ""please sir, I want some more""

$MT: ""More?!?!?""

$MT: No problem, it's another $50/ton""

Customer: ""Please sir, I want some more""

$MT: ""More?!?!""

$MT: Sure another $100/ton and it will ship in June, oh and by the way, you'll have to pay extra by then because your price is now the price we agreed upon and adders, so PRICE TIME OF SHIPMENT.

By the way, that is becoming common-place in the steel industry today.

NOTICE HOW THE PRICE INCREASES ARE **RETROACTIVE??!!**

This is becoming common-place and this is how steelmakers ENSURE their margins in markets where raw materials are running faster than they can buy them.

This is part of my thesis as to why these companies are going to show INCREASED REVENUE and most importantly - **INCREASED PROFITS.**

383,GME,l2iczw,2021-01-22 08:04:49,GME DD: Float breakdown + MOASS speculations," This is a somewhat long read. Let’s start with the summary.

# Tldr;

* VW-like MOASS is likely to happen regardless of whether we 💎hand or not; and whether we keep stocks in cash vs margin. Pussy 🧻🖐are not going to make the squeeze any weaker but rather they will just miss out on the best part.
* The true float is not enough to cover all shorts. (not new, but detailed holding breakdown below)
* The most violent part of the squeeze is likely to happen on the last 1-2 days of the squeeze, not the beginning. 
* The end (peak) of the squeeze is not in our hands as much as it is in the hands of large institutional holders, insiders or a company offering.
* 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

**Disclaimer**: I’m a simple retard trying to understand the mechanics of the market. This is not advice on what to do. If you have input your feedback is welcome.

# Float deep dive

Previous DDs suggested that the violence of the squeeze depends on the ratio between shorted shares and available shares they can buy to cover. 

I wanted to understand exactly what this ratio is like right now and going into the squeeze. The purpose of this exercise for me was to gather data available on all holdings (institutions, insiders and mutual funds) to find out exactly how much float there is.

## True float 

Before looking at the data, let’s talk about float vs true float. True float is a word I came up with to help myself understand how many shares are available for shorters to purchase.

As mentioned in previous DDs, each 1 share sold short creates another synthetic long share. This explains why the total shares in the market are larger than the number of shares issued by the company.

Thus, the true float = share float + synthetic longs from each short

= share float + short interest = \~117M

Now, let’s take a look at how much of that true float is available to trade. I’ve compiled this sheet below to break down the holdings of insiders, mutual funds and institutional holdings. Note that this doesn’t account for WSB holdings.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gg7lm3zj1uc61.png?width=3356&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8c77a8a0b8e8cecef2ad754a04029d302fc52e3

 

## Observations

* Insiders and institutional holdings alone account for more than 100% of the company issued shares. 
   * In other words, the shorts simply cannot cover their shorts from the market alone. 
   * This is what previous DD’s referred to as negative float.
*  The share/float ratio currently is roughly 2.3:1

# Why I don’t think holding in cash vs margin makes much of a difference

The premise from previous DD’s is that holding in cash accounts and not margin means shorters can no longer borrow the stocks to short further. This is absolutely correct. 

Essentially, my understanding is shorters can borrow any share from the “true float”  (including synthetic longs) to short sell it again. They can just keep shorting the stock forever pretty much if they have infinite money.

Eventually, some of those synthetic longs created by shorting will arrive in a 💎hand cash account, which reduces the amount of borrowable shares from the true float.

Thus, available to short for shorters= True float - cash account 💎hand shares.

When the shares available to short are reduced, they become hard to borrow and brokers raise borrow rates on them. This makes shorters bleed faster.

While I agree that holding in cash account makes shorters bleed faster, I don’t think it makes a difference in the eventual occurrence of the squeeze because:

1. Shorters don’t have infinite money to keep shorting it forever. 
2. I’d expect brokers would raise borrow rates regardless of borrow availability since shorting a fast climbing stock has a high risk and the stock is climbing very fast.
3. It’s obvious that the sentiment is shifting very positively in the favor of GME. Anyone trying to short it further at this point is playing with fire and risking bankruptcy.
4. Once the squeeze starts, it should get very violent. Shorting this stock during it’s squeeze sounds like suicide so I’m speculating no new shorts will be open during the squeeze until news of an offering or something comes out.

In other words, buying on margin seems equally good to me if you’re considering it. But if you can keep your shares in cash, go for it as it may bleed the shorters sooner rather than later.

# Why I think VW-like MOASS is still likely to happen even though the current short:float ratio is not like VW

The short:float ratio is not constant.

Since insiders, institutions and mutual funds hold over 100% of the float, it seems to be the case that the entirety of our shares are synthetic longs created due to shorts.

As shorts cover, synthetic long shares disappear from the market. As the true float grows smaller, the ratio between the remaining shorts needed to cover and the remaining float will change.

To imagine this, I created a chart to try to visualize what happens to the short/float ratio during the squeeze for different possibilities of days to cover.

Since it’s hard for me to predict how many shorts will cover exactly each day, I made some basic assumptions:

* Let’s assume that for D days to cover, each day will see (SI / D) shorts covered. In other words, the shorts will be covered evenly over the days to cover.
   * This probably isn’t very accurate. In reality I expect the shorts covered to start small then increase dramatically each day due to margin calls.
   * If anything, I’d imagine this means reality should be more violent than this chart.
* Let’s assume insiders and institutions will sell 20% of their holdings prior to or during the squeeze
   * 20% makes it more of a worst case scenario.
   * I see how it makes sense to think that insiders and institutional holders would want to take advantage of the situation and sell more.
   * However, if those people have anything close to even a fresh grad intern working on this, they should understand that by holding longer they are creating fortunes for themselves.
* Let’s assume no new short positions will be opened during the squeeze
   * This seems straightforward. Can you imagine someone shorting VW during its squeeze? They would be out of their mind. 
   * Even if someone is that crazy, I’d expect brokers would have skyrocketing fees.

Following the above assumptions, I created the following tables. Each table represents the outstanding SI, the available to trade float, and short:available ratio respectively.

To visualize the data above, let’s put it on a chart. Y axis is short:float ratio.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c7smltol1uc61.png?width=1717&format=png&auto=webp&s=973c78faae78a78f0e1ae64fc34a12a7e33b1b05

&#x200B;

 

Observations

1. The short:float ratio becomes somewhat exponential as time passes due to supply shortage.
   1. NOTE: It looks like the lines end early at small values. Don't fret, this simply means there are no shares available anymore after this day, aka the line tends to infinity.
2. The squeeze becomes way more violent, more violent than VW, on later days (especially past 2-3 days) for all of different hypothetical values of days to cover.
3. In all scenarios, there will become a point at which there are simply no shares available (negative) for short positions to purchase to cover.

Point (3) here is what makes this squeeze an infinity squeeze like a previous DD called it. Essentially, at this point remaining short positions are at the mercy of insiders, institutions, mutual funds or a company offering. Heck, even the offering of $100M may not be enough shares to cover the remaining short positions when the price skyrockets.

I’m just a retard trying to wrap my head around this to arrive at this observation. However it’s safe to assume all of the above entities should be completely aware of this situation and the possibility of an infinity squeeze. I don’t see why they wouldn’t want to take advantage of this situation to name their price. Institutions could sell out and make deals with Melvin and shorters but they would be acting against their self interest; I'm assuming they can just get paid by brokers even if Melvin et al. go bankrupt.

My conclusion - 

The infinity squeeze is somewhat inevitable. It may likely start small. Once it starts, it will keep getting more violent each day. If shorts start covering and the stock skyrockets, chances are it will skyrocket aggressively further each day for the next 2-3 days until institutional holdings sell or the company announces an offering which seem unlikely to start early.

Positions: \~8,000 shares, no limit orders set. Company fair value in my book is >$100 without a squeeze.

The whole thing is about JPM and squeezing silver. $GME was at $5 back then and /u/DeepFuckingValue was still getting laughed at for buying at every opportunity. Rest of you fuckers had barely gotten over the last cult following, PRPL mattresses.  
\- 6 months ago, /u/lucasandrew talks about ""[Why you should trade futures - WSB Edition](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i3qkex/why_you_should_trade_futures_wsb_edition/)"", in which he mentions ""*Speaking of SLV, people have been posting all the reasons that JPM fucks with the SLV ETF*"". Yeah, I bet he took a fucking time-machine back 6 months in time after Citadel got stuck in the boo-boo. 

\- 6 months ago, /u/LE0TARD0 implores the ""[SILVER CHAD'S RISE UP!](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hy7nvn/silver_chads_rise_up/)"". A straight fundamental thread on why silver is undervalued, not mention JPM. However, in the comments, a thread is started by /u/kbtech18 and supplemented by /u/ayyayyron talking about precisely JPM and their price manipulation of silver. YEAH, NO THAT NEVER HAPPENED, I'M SORRY FOR BEING A SHILL, LIKE FUCKING TAKE YOUR TINFOIL HATS OFF YOU DUMB SHITS!

After hailing his fellow degenerates, HE IMMEDIATELY SAYS: ""*I know there has been 6 billion posts about silver,""* before later writing ""*A large amount of contracts will stand for delivery such as in July. If its enough, maybe some of the big banks who have short positions might find themselves in hot water with their silver delivery amounts."".* Isn't IT JUST GLORIOUS HOW MELVIN AND CITADEL HAVE ALL THESE TIME MACHINES TO MAKE UP IMAGINARY SILVER SQUEEZES 6 MONTHS BEFORE THEY WERE MADE UP?

\- 5 months ago (YOU GUYS, MAYBE YOU ARE RIGHT, ALL THE POSTS ARE FROM 5-6 MONTHS AGO, MAYBE IT REALLY IS A TIME TRAVELLING CONSPIRACY BY MELVIN AND CITADEL, YES, LET'S GO WITH THAT!), /u/jetter23, wrote ""[Weekend Update - Silver](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i6l0o2/weekend_update_silver/)"". What did he have to share, in terms of ideas and DD? "" *4a) Banks will continue to fight us on silver, but they are losing as they were massively short,*  "". WHAT SNEAKY FRICKIN' MARKET MANIPULATING HEDGE FUND SHILL HE IS, JUST GOING BACK SO FAR IN TIME TO SET US UP FOR THE PERFECT TRAP TO HELP CITADEL!!!

\- /u/jetter23 was quite active shilling 5 months ago, he also wrote ""[Weekend Update - Silver (DD#3)](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i9uxok/weekend_update_silver_dd3/)"", where he just casually mentioned ""*JPM is currently under DOJ investigation AGAIN for price speculation on Silver. JPM is learning a VERY expensive lesson that when there is a pandemic, global FIAT currencies are crashing(like the DXY), and there is a run on physical metals - you can't be naked short on paper.""* IT'S ALMOST LIKE HE'S TALKING ABOUT SOME SORT OF SILVER SHORT SQUEEZE ON JPM, BUT HEY, THAT CAN'T BE IT BECAUSE THAT'S JUST A SCAM FAKE NEWS IDEA THAT'S 2-3 DAYS OLD, RIGHT? 

\- /u/CCJ_Moon_6969 popped his head into the stream of tachyons, relatively talking to us from the present all the way 6 months ago, when he wrote ""[Silver. $SLV call options. New York Comex.](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hy8wv9/silver_slv_call_options_new_york_comex/)"". Do you remember /u/kbtech18 from a few threads up? WELL, GEE WHIZ, HE COVERED THAT TIME STREAM TOO, talking about JPM and silver. 6 months ago. I mean, today. Reddit probably changed the timestamps on the posts. DAMN SHILLS!  
\- /u/rawvi wrote ""[JPM and Silver](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i88cyy/jpm_and_silver/)"" 5 months ago, wanting to learn more about... time travel.

**TLDR:** GME🚀 bears r fuk

🚀🚀 🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 💎✋💎  🚀🚀 🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 💎✋💎

**The questions you should be asking...**

People have left out all the fund traded shares that are owned (likely locked into place unless it moons and they have to rebalance). You're leaving out all the synthetic shares floating out around because of the shorts, and the facts the institutions or their allies are front running those shorts likely. Citron has also ignited a fight with some funds that have a bone to pick.

You're leaving out that the shorts also ARE NOT GETTING DELIVERED. Just because a broker has the shares on their books to short does NOT mean those shares are delivered.

How do I know? [https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)

GameStop's been on it far too long.

But brokers don't give a fuck, because SEC doesn't give enough of a fuck to do anything about it. They also don't give a FUCK about you. They only give a fuck with someone that matters enough does something wrong enough that someone else who matters enough gets hurt. Why did Elon get charged? There were a few institutions betting against it, remember?

&#x200B;

**Questions for you**

Have you checked institutional inflow estimates? Have you checked L2 aggregated orders? Have you peeked at the bulk order flows?

Do you actually have any idea how fucked the shorts are? Because if you did, you'd second mortgage your fucking house and put it on the line (do **NOT** do this you fucking idiot, it's a figure of speech).

&#x200B;

**General thesis as of today:**

* Institutions are fighting each other, not just us
* Enough people have enemies within Wall Street, they're willing to pad their bottom lines after a year like we've had if the risk is minimal and greater for the other side (because one side has to give in first, humans can only take so much punishment)
* Citron is obviously, blatantly manipulating the stock via the methods I describe below (note, today there were shares available to be loaned, and right before his stream, there was a massive short attack and then VIOLA there were no more shares to borrow. I don't know if this is coordinated with institutions, but the fuckers only worth $5M, he doesn't have the money to do what is going on by himself. **It could easily be algorithms just picking up news** on the wire and inappropriately acting on it.
* Institutional inflows, bulk orders, and dark pools allow the type of wars we're watching (explained below)
* I think there's just general interest in the stock, the added upside is that Citron and Melvin get fucked in the process of us owning a revolutionary gaming company
* Cohen is going to change things, and hopefully he goes on Benzinga tomorrow to give commentary

&#x200B;

🚀🚀 🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 💎✋💎  🚀🚀 🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 💎✋💎

&#x200B;

**On how the volume is behaving and what is going on likely:**

As far as institutional inflows those and bulk order flows sometimes go together. Also, some dark pools aggregate their orders so what looks like a bunch of 1000, 500, 250, 50, 90, 110 share lots when people are selling are actually a single lot of 2000 etc.

These dark pools are used as back channels for some private funds that have broker access to the street, and help to disguise institutional movements mostly for hedge funds and speculative funds.

By looking at inflow estimate reports (you have to be in the industry to get access to most of this, it comes from extremely expensive research firms that brokers pay, or they have a team in house doing it) along with bulk orders, and trying to match those to the T&S tape ticker, you can start to see perhaps who is moving what.

If someone transacts let's say, 1M shares, and you can attribute it to a single individual somehow (if the pool didn't aggregate their order into another order to mix it into the execution cycle which normally they do to try and hide it) you can get an idea of what the true tradeable float is (if you don't get why, it's because you don't buy a million shares of something to day trade it, those are sitting at home for awhile, a long while).

Those institutions buying those shares will let the price fall, then throw 50-100k of their shares through. You don't just execute a buy or sell of 1M shares @ $40, it's a thousand here, thousand there and the algo tries to get you the best price possible. Often you'll see dips, massive buy spikes, then buy/sell walls go up at price points where their average is to try and build a retail base also. Considering originally there was a low percentage of outstanding shares traded per day, building that base will take time because institutional ownership is so huge. Once that is built, they just have to counter act any shorts, and see even 50 basis point increase in volume could set this entire thing off.

Those short attacks will stop once the shorts get out of their position but the base will remain and the hunger for the shares will remain. If the short float falls a bit, it actually will help us believe it or not, because the people that are going to get fucked here aren't the institutional traders - it's the big retail whales and 9 figure individuals betting against this. The big firms are already hedged, I promise you.

With the short volume being met by institutional buying volume, I estimate the actual float to be much, much, much smaller than the numbers we're seeing. Institutional ownership is over 100% -- this is ONLY possible by buying synthetic shares that are shorted.

All of this combined shows me that we have firms going at each other. A couple retail whales come in and upset that balance of power, and we're going to see this thing rip upwards. What you're likely seeing is firms day trading calls on swings (yes, calls, not puts) and forcing those swings to help them profit some, then cover some of their shares and slowly reduce the delta of their positions. They're not trading puts because that just exaggerates their delta, they trade the calls in case the thing fucking flies to the moon, their losses are capped as it sits now, and they're likely trading portions of their share position. 10% at a time, and if they have enough capital, they can drag this fight out for a long fucking time. There's no benefit for them to unwind all at once, it could set this thing into the stratosphere. It's potentially possible many of them have various dated $20 calls to help cover their short (and by possible, I mean likely, because the algos probably hedged as soon as it saw the price/volume explode when it moved off the $20 mark and identified the possible buttfucking their short position was about to give them) and they're just slamming volume around trying to create volatility because that's the best for the people writing the options (them and their friends). For all we know, some of these shorts are completely hedged just building it up to profit off the squeeze. If the shares rip up once they get out of the position, they don't care, because they'll hold to expiration for hedge, exercise, take the gains, and tank the stock again and short it on the way down while hedging the upside again. If the stock goes down, they can dump the calls and just let their short ride back down a ways. The calls are their cap -- similar to people buying a debit spread instead of long calls.

But with Melvin's puts likely expired and not re-upped in any identifiable way, that means we know one guy is really under the heat and already way fucking down on his position, which causes desperation. Humans can only take so much. Match that up with Citron's extreme fucking failures over the course of the last two years, we got a couple guys with reputations and millions on the line.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# FOR THE NOOBS

&#x200B;

* **ELI5**

GME🚀 bears r fuk

&#x200B;

* **When is the short squeeze going to happen?**

I have no idea when. Whenever the institutions are happy with their positions, probably.

Days to cover means shit, for every person that covers, at this point, someone else is going to take their spot because enough firms think that it's going down and they would love that because they want a better entry on the long term. Believe it or not, regardless of Credit Suisse's way off price target, there's numerous VC firms and big whales looking at this right now wondering if WSB got something right, and if they understand the industry better. Most these guys don't understand gaming, it's a new, growing industry.

The catch is that someone has to be the first one to jump, like cliff diving into water you don't know the depth of. If one firm jumps, others may join. But if they jump and are wrong, they're tied into that investment and can't be non-directional if they're making an investment based play since that would be bad to suppress price for the company they're invested in and a violation of fiduciary responsibility.

This is part of the reason that long term, we could benefit from a pullback. Let some of the assholes off the hook so the real price can be determined by the market.

I used to post DD and stock picks on here under another name. I may start again soon, I stopped for personal reasons and deleted that account, that was almost 2 years ago.

&#x200B;

* **Meta: How do I learn to be good at trading?**

Learn the market first, learn how to trade without any of the finance knowledge. This knowledge really doesn't help me trade all that much, it helps me understand why I win or lose, but knowing how to pick entries/exits and how to control my emotions is the best thing I've learned although I'm unhinged on Melvin and Citron

How I Made $2M In The Stock Market by Nicholas Darvas, then review Bill O Neill's shit with a grain of salt, don't follow CANSLIM to the T, but some of the ideas are sound like how to identify growth companies.

After that, mess around trading shares and just make a goal to profit. If you're down, analyze the position and thesis and decide if you will get a profitable spot later, if so, learn discipline and hold. If not, cut it loose and start another trade.

Do it about 50,000 times over 10,000 hours and you'll get good at it.

&#x200B;

***In Conclusion:*** If you're in the industry, you have access to shit others don't (not implying I am, or how I know these things). You should be able to watch a price/volume chart during the day and instantly identify institutional activity.

Fuck Melvin and Fuck Andrew Left and Shitron. It's one thing to be in a firm and short a stock for fundamental reasons. It's a whole other thing to let your ego get in the way after you drove the price down to $3 and go for the jugular just to make yourself feel better. The guy deserves the fucking $200-$300M loss he's about to eat at the current price, probably more considering the options he had expired and he's likely got some other hedges in place that won't work out for him.

This isn't to flex knowledge, it's to tell people you should be careful just spreading info around this board and getting people on board with a thesis. We're all mostly right on the idea that there's a squeeze coming, but it isn't for the reasons that we're saying.

**The mania around here now has the public viewing us as some goddamn conglomerate pump and dump scheme. That shit has to stop. We're just dudes with small accounts compared to the real big fish, and we believe in $GME.**

Therefore, I suggest that we switch to other brokerage platforms that also offer free stock trading (options may not be free) and make sure that Robinhood's IPO becomes a bust. If their DAU, MAU, and other performance metrics that ties into their valuation drops, we will have sent a clear signal to the world that the billionaire institutions and all their cronies do not get to unfairly tip the scales in their favor any longer.

I DO NOT BELIEVE FOR ONE SECOND THAT THESE GREEDY FUCKS HAVE COVERED OVER 60% OF THEIR SHORT INTEREST ON THESE LOW VOLUME DOWN DAYS BUT EVEN IF THEY DID YOU BETTER BELIEVE THAT WHAT WE'RE SEEING THIS MORNING IS THEM DOUBLING DOWN AND NAKED SHORT SELLING ONCE AGAIN!,"**If you sell today you're going to regret it for the rest of your life!** These greedy HF's can only pull so many shares out of their ass before they will be out of ammo. They're just trying to lower the price so they can:

1. Cover at the lowest price possible
2. Buy the shares they need to deliver by TODAY for all the calls that were exercised Friday at the lo
3. lowest price possible

&#x200B;

**There is no way the real short interest percentage is 53% but even if it is, THATS STILL HIGH AF!** You think these greedy HF's are just going to cover and then leave the stock alone? Right now they think they have you on the ropes so they're tripling down and shorting this shit on the way down! You know what that means? They're shorting it at $115 instead of $450 which is WAYYY more risky. It's super easy to justify $115 fundamentally for GME without even taking into consideration the squeeze.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**We're in a desert right now and the HF's are dying of thirst and we have the water.** Are you going to sell it them at a loss for peanut? Fuck no! These guys have screwed us over for so long and we're going to give in and let them win? There is no way in hell that if we just hold that we don't go to the moon.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**How many of the sales today will turn out to be failures to deliver?** They're literally selling fake shares right now to drive the price down and we're not going to believe their BS! They're eventually going to have to pay back these shares and we're going to make them pay OUR price for them.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Buy low, sell high!** Do you have cash in your account? Buy low? When you're buying you should probably feel a little hesitant, that's how you know you're getting a good deal! Holding shares? Don't sell! You're supposed to sell high not sell low you dumb fuck.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**This will be the defining moment of this sub.** You better believe that the smart money on wall street is buying right now. Are you going to join them on this rocket ship to the moon or are you going to pussy out and step off the spacecraft right before take off?

450,GME,lasuet,2021-02-02 11:40:31,How to Win GME,"This week, we have experienced blatant market manipulation from the other side. They have spread misdirection via fake stories from corrupt reporters. They have used computer algorithms that buy and sell from each other to drive the price down. Monday's exact -100 result was a giant FU to us, telling us they control the price.

However, we have the power of numbers and we have the power of public sentiment. We are fighting an honorable battle against an EVIL foe. We are on the side of good, and there is a very simple strategy that we can use to win.

**Go to a cash account**. If EVERYONE with a brokerage account, even people who don't own GME stock, contacted their broker and turned their account into a CASH account, that will stop our brokers from lending our shares to hedge funds to use to short stocks. If EVERYONE did this, all lent out shares would be called back and hedge funds would have to close their short positions by BUYING shares. They will have to buy shares all across the market and those stocks will go up in price. They will have to sell some long shares in order to come up with capital to close their shorts, but overall the market should be neutral.

We don't control fake news. We don't manipulate stocks. We just like stocks and like talking about them. Our strength is in our solidarity and we have the support of the people. If we can make this into a movement and ask people to stop using margin and turn their accounts into CASH accounts in solidarity with us, we will win. Also, it will PISS them off because they can't cheat their way around it.

CASH ACCOUNT FTW.

You still have one mountain to climb, however.

YOUR USER INTERFACE IS EMBARRASSINGLY TERRIBLE. I am well aware of the time, effort, energy, and capital you’ve spent building your app and website over the years, and that’s great. However, RobinHood has walked the fucking dog on you when it comes to simplicity, ease of use, and approachability. They’ve brought millions of new investors to the market, and have had world changing successes, of which I’m sure you’re all well aware of (you know, like when they changed the game my forcing you to make trades free?).

I’m a Gen X Millennial, and although I may be able to adapt to your convoluted-ass website and mobile app, a lot of the future investors will not have the patience or inclination to do the same. *You have to change it, and do it quickly.* It needs to be sleek, modern, and user-friendly. You don’t have to copy RobinHood (hell, why would you want to?), but you do have to come up with something that can keep the influx of new customers from jumping ship once their aboard, and **I’m not talking about making it hard for us to leave, you have to make it easy for us to stay.**

The last week’s debacle is as best an opportunity as you’ll ever have to catapult yourself into the front of your industry. It’s the World Series, bottom of the 9th, the bases are loaded, and you’re down by 3. RobinHood is pitching with a broken arm, and you are the batter with the .989 average.

&#x200B;

**Thesis:**

Goldman Sachs and the big boys have deleveraged their stake in GME and said they are reducing risk while also calling what already happened as the squeeze and that other hedges deleveraged as well. I can't tell if this is FUD or if they truly believe this. This info is in their daily customer subscription mailers, only actual GS customers get these mailers afaik. I don't know what is the truth anymore.

If Yellen wants to meet for volatility on a fizzling stock that is 98.4% ish locked in by buyers, this screams all kinds of alarms in my head. They are either going to try and stop the party or they are looking for money to pay us and not crash everything at the same time.

Tomorrow is the final fight. Yellen and all the bigwigs are the bosses.

Also i think it makes sense for the squeeze to happen this week before Friday due to the naked short puts the HFTs have been selling that are likely 2/05 of expiry. They DO NOT want this squeeze to happen next week when all those shorts are gone and the price is back way up. They also don't want the squeeze to happen on Friday due to the extreme volatility due to their naked 2/05 puts.

If all that makes sense, this means that the squeeze is coming tomorrow or the day after and NOT next week or this Friday.

494,HAS,l8a8r7,2021-01-30 02:23:58,GAMESTONK - THE SQUEEZE HAS NOT SQUOZEN AND THE INFINITY WAR CONTINUES!,"Dear autist army,

&#x200B;

Some of you may have read (or seen because you cannot read) my post yesterday about a Gamma squeeze today. ([1/29/21 - The Great Battle For Valhalla](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7b6t7/12921_the_battle_for_valhalla_gammainfinity/)) While I believe a Gamma squeeze in fact occurred, it was curtailed and did not catalyze the MOASS (Mother of All Short Squeezes) because brokerages like ROBINHOOD intentionally limited our ability to buy shares/apply pressure to the shorts 🩳AKA 👿Melvin Capital AKA 👿Citadel LLC.

&#x200B;

To be clear:

&#x200B;

[Melvin Capital 👿](https://preview.redd.it/f3wgl6mswde61.jpg?width=326&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9aa66ee90c72d260693450cd2be6d5bcb022960b)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Us 👨‍🚀👨‍🚀👨‍🚀 --\> What is your profession? DIAMOND HANDING LIKE A WSB RETARD! 🤚🏻💎](https://preview.redd.it/s0kflystwde61.jpg?width=385&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f6863f1f9cba33c8264afd44e912a78ed3e59d06)

&#x200B;

**BUT WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN LIEUTENANT** u/Brassmonkeynutzz?

&#x200B;

Ok. Let's start with the basics for all of you who are wet behind the ears. What is a Gamma squeeze you ask? A Gamma squeeze occurs when option sellers/market makers buy shares of the underlying stock to hedge their positions/prepare for the possibility that call option buyers decide to exercise their right to buy. This type of hedge is necessary when a significant amount of call option strikes are expiring in the money (last week all available strikes expired in the money on a stock for the first time in financial history and this week a shit load of strikes expired in the money as well).

&#x200B;

Wait, you aren't actually reading this are you? If you are, I appreciate you. For those of you who cannot read (all of you), please see the TL;CR at the bottom of this post. (Hint: 🚀)

&#x200B;

Anyways, you might be wondering, why would Robinhood risk its reputation and entire business by limiting its customers ability to buy? Simple: ""Robinhood’s regulatory filings show the company charges large investment firms called “market makers” (👿CITADEL/MELVIN) fees to access real-time information about which stocks its users are buying and selling, a practice some regulators and industry watchers have seen as a potential conflict of interest."" In fact, ""Robinhood routes more than half of its customer orders to Citadel, by far its largest market-making partner by volume, Robinhood disclosures show."" ([source](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/robinhood-and-citadels-relationship-comes-into-focus-as-washington-vows-to-examine-stock-market-moves/ar-BB1ddG06))

&#x200B;

In other words, Robinhood is more concerned about saving the GAY BEARS 🌈🐻 that they are in bed with (their real customers - 👿CITADEL/MELVIN) than servicing retail investors like us. Ironically, Robinhood is taking from the poor and giving to the rich—it is ass backwards.

&#x200B;

Before I go any further, I have to once again congratulate all of the true autists who have diamond handed 🙌🏻💎thus far. Thank you for holding. You are truly retarded and I salute you. And of course, I salute our King, u/DeepFuckingValue🤴, with the utmost respect. We fought valiantly in ""The Great Battle for Valhalla"" today. And it is very promising that EVEN DESPITE Robinhood limiting our retarded power, we went from closing at 196 yesterday to 328 at close today, and 312 as I write this post. But clearly, this infinity war is far from over.

&#x200B;

If you sold like a paper handed pussy 📄🤚🏻🙀, then you are not a true WSB autist soldier. You are not one of us. Go invest in an ETF and leave this sub forever!

&#x200B;

**But I am a true autist, what can I do?**

&#x200B;

First things first, GTFO of Robinhood immediately if you do not have options expiring within the next week and transfer your portfolio to literally any other brokerage.  **(EDIT: Transferring will lock up your shares/portfolio until the transfer is complete, which could take a week or so; so only transfer now if you are ok with that—I am just so disgusted with RH at this point that I almost don't care and will be diamond handing my shares for more than a week most likely anyways).**  They are fucking criminals and they are trying to delay/mitigate the MOASS. I am personally transferring to **(EDIT) FIDELITY** unless you tards have a better suggestion.

&#x200B;

For those of you who were clenching when we got down to around 126 yesterday and around 250 today. I know you were scared. But the following cannot be overstated: **THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT! FEAR!!!!!**

&#x200B;

**JUST FUCKING HOLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!** THEY WANT YOUR FUCKING SHARES SO BAD BECAUSE THERE IS A HUGE SHORTAGE.

&#x200B;

**HOLD THE MOTHERFUCKING LINE AND WE RIDE TO VALHALLA!**

&#x200B;

[HODOR 🙌🏻💎](https://preview.redd.it/95wf66vlxde61.jpg?width=275&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=27b19f0511ed659d3bfbce8c033e0f5b9fe4a988)

&#x200B;

Shortage? YES A FUCKING SHORTAGE. Over 100% shares are still shorted. Do not listen to anyone who says Melvin Capital has closed out their short position. That is total bullshit.

&#x200B;

But, but, but, WhY iS CNBC AdVeRtIsInG tHaT MeLvIn ClOsEd iTs sHoRt pOsItiOn tHeN 🤪? ([Great post talking about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8539h/cnbc_now_running_ads_promoting_that_melvin/)) I mean seriously, ask yourselves, why the fuck would CNBC run paid advertisements about the shorts closing their positions? BECAUSE THE BIG BOYS WANT YOU TO THINK THE SQUEEZE IS OVER SO YOU SELL AND GIVE UP. FEAR NOT; THE SQUEEZE HAS NOT SQUOZEN!

&#x200B;

**Think about it:** if Melvin closed its short position, it would simply move on to the next trade and never look back. There would not be any reason to ***pay*** to advertise that.

&#x200B;

**Summary:** the big dogs want you to think the squeeze is over, and they want you to panic and sell your shares. DO...NOT...DO...IT! Instead, **HOLD! BUY THE DIP! REPEAT!**

&#x200B;

**Monday, we ride at dawn!**

Sincerely, Lieutenant u/Brassmonkeynutzz
