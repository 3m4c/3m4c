15,KNOW,lavvxc,2021-02-02 14:51:43,150 - 250 for GME is the sweet spot for hedges. Lowering the price risks VOLUME jumps. THEY KNOW THIS.,"Right now the Hedges are in a bit of a bind. I'm not going to repeat all the excellent DD you can already read on the front page. I however will bring up some important thoughts about the publics' spending habits. Buying shares above $150 a share is very expensive for Joe America, average citizen who doesn't do a lot of investments. I have been floored by the number of people willing to spend their real hard-earned money on this movement so far. Congrats to you for keeping all of us afloat. 

We have all seen that VOLUME is very important for keeping GME share price up but volume is not necessary for the ladder attacks to drop the price down. So why haven't they run the price into the ground yet? Because they risk volume jumps. The moment this stock drops below $100/share dramatically increases its affordability. The cheaper it gets the more people will be able to justify adding more to their portfolios. This is exactly what the hedges don't want. They are already in a share shortage. The last thing they want to do is drop the price of GME so low that it causes a massive buying spree. 

So how do they fix this? They do it with FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt). They want the world to think the money train has left the station and all that is left is free fall. They want to crush everyone's spirit so that when it comes time to ground that price, no one will want to buy it. WE CANNOT LET THIS HAPPEN. We need to keep our heads high and TRUST that the short positions have not been resolved. We need to TRUST that the Hedges still have a ton of debt obligations that need to be rectified. Any time we see the share price dip below $100 I suggest buying every share you can get your hands on. I know I will. They will be testing the waters over the next few weeks just to see how much enthusiasm is left for this stock. The rollercoaster will get worse. and seeing red for days/weeks is a test of our collective willpower. 

DO NOT SELL WHEN IT JUMPS TO 800. Do not think this is some lucky fluke and to get out while the getting is good. This is WHAT THEY WANT. They want to crush you so that when they give you crumbs you jump on the chance to show some return. 

TLDR: HOLD, BUY LOW, HOLD until 10k 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Edit3: Mark Cuban on his AMA just confirmed this: “So what to do ?
If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.
Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work.
I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.
I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street.”",DD,0.98

And now we're here.

It seems that people are blind as a rock when they see DFV's daily GME Yolo Updates.

Do you bother fucking reading anything? Ever? I mean, I get it, I write walls of text... but DFV uploads a single picture and you can't even bother reading that picture... Come on, that's prime savant! You literally cannot be helped if you're one of these people.

Here's what I mean,

[This is one of the first few posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d31bke/gme_yolo_update_following_the_q2_earnings_report/) by DFV uploaded on Sep 11, 2019.

All other things ignored, do you notice something? **Look at the ""CASH"" pile. It reads: $13,962.21**

Great, remember that fucking number because we're going to progress through this fiasco of ""he hasn't sold"".

I'm not gonna bother with a daily, or monthly reminder of how great DFV is at risk management. So let's skip a few months and head straight to [December 17 2020, here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kf69j1/gme_yolo_update_dec_17_2020/).

Notice something odd? Something remarkable? **The cash pile reads $1,105,069.48.**

Alright, maybe he just added a million more to his account by taking a HELOC against his rented house (how's that possible, I don't fucking know, anything's possible on wsb). But let's extend the usual WSB benefit of the doubt to DFV, because that's the least we can do. We're going to ignore the voice of reason and just say the dude took out 1mill against his mortgage to blow on GME YOLOs.

Cool, let's move on.

Total $3.6m - Cash pile on [Dec 25, 2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kk0g0f/gme_yolo_christmas_update_dec_25_2020/): $1,116,831.85

Total $5.78m - Cash pile on [Jan 13, 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwpviw/gme_yolo_update_jan_13_2021/): $1,128,842.20

Do you notice a trend, you smooth-brained jizz rocket? I really hope you do.

DFV, time and time again has proven to be a great investor. How could he not be, he hunts VALUE stocks, not YOLOs. His thesis on GME wasn't driven by a squeeze, but rather a company that was being sold on the market for cheaper than it was worth. Watch his videos, and you'll find that.

He just truly stuck by his thesis and the squeeze was the cherry on top of the cake... and while you idiots keep thinking he's not selling because all you read is the ""Total pile"", you're failing to realize he probably has brilliant stop losses that have taken his $50k to nearly $14m already. And as always, he's letting the rest ride. This is called... letting the winners ride.

You'll also notice his rolling of the options, and I don't know if they are strategic, but they are brilliant. Another indicator of him not being smooth brained.

Now, read his future daily updates carefully. I'm out.

**TLDR:** You're a savant, you don't need a TLDR... but I'll try. DFV has cashed out $14m worth of gains, and the top comment is always ""If he's still in, I'm still in"". In reality, DFV has fucked the game on so many levels, the game now calls him daddy. Rightfully so.

29,GME,l6py0p,2021-01-28 07:23:53,GME Wars: Suits Strike Back. WARNING FOR ALL YOU FELLOW AUTISTS,"Obligatory I’m not a financial advisor this is not blah blah blah.

Okay GME gang. We’ve got the shorts on the ropes. They’re bleeding hard and all the billionaire suits are shitting themselves out of fear. They’ve tried false information, getting on CNBC and screaming for regulation of our “market manipulation,” trying to get us shut down, Biden administration tweet, saying shorts have already covered, etc. None of it has worked so far and they’re still bleeding money.

Now they’re truly desperate. What’s something they haven’t tried quite yet but very well could be setting up to do?

MARKET CRASH

Yes, that’s right. I believe with what I’m currently seeing, they are going to crash the market and blame it on us. Do I think you need to be concerned about GME? No, because holding it should still work and they still have to cover anyway, but this is definitely to try to get you scared and sell GME and so they can take your money back when you reinvest elsewhere.

I don’t think I have to tell many of you that the current levels are at/above where the market was valued in 2008 before the crash according to the Buffet indicator. All this says is that we’re probably in a market bubble, and it’s been at these levels for months now. But guess what just started getting talked about by all the suits? That’s right. A bubble. And who are they blaming? Us.

Now that I have your attention, let’s look at a few other things.

[This is the Volatility Index the past week.](https://imgur.com/gallery/C9ETmMR) Notice how it’s been steadily rising and suddenly spiked today? 40 is typically the resistance before the market makes a downturn. If this thing gets above that we’ll probably be seeing the market dropping quickly.

Additionally, there the spurts of high volume absolutely dumping stocks for short amounts of time. That’s one of the first things I noticed before the March crash and I’ve been seeing it get more and more abundant the last few weeks and picking up a lot today. [Notice the large red volume candles on the weekly SPY chart.](https://imgur.com/a/w0y33Lq) (Robinhood screenshot on a DD post??? Yes, I know. I’m on my phone with limited time. Deal with it lol.)

Now you might say, “it’s earnings season and there have been some bad earnings so far and that’s expected in this tough time.” Well yes, but there’s the Apple earnings today. They beat earnings pretty nicely and what did the stock do? [You guessed it (I hope).](https://imgur.com/a/Txc7po6)

Currently we’re seeing fundamentally strong companies as well as the S&P 500 beginning to drop and the volatility increase market wide. You could say this is “smart money” pulling out because they see the overvalued stocks. However, there were many worldwide financial issues sparking before the March crash. It just needed a catalyst, AKA global pandemic. Now we’re in a similar boat. Market issues in need of a catalyst.

What is that catalyst this time around? That’s right. A bunch of “millennials on a message board who have no place in stocks creating a market bubble.” Basically this isn’t smart money pulling out here. It’s MAD MONEY (hi Cramer). They are declaring WAR. They are pissed that we are “stealing” their billions on billions of dollars from them and they will do whatever it takes to get you to sell and take your money away from you again, including wrecking the market and the economy once again. The suits are out for blood now.

Do I think this will effect GME much? Only if you don’t sell. All this is scare tactics and ways to win your money back if keeping GME suppressed fails even more than it already has. There are hardly any shares to short if any at all and retail investors and autists are likely the ones holding most of the shares that could be sold.

Be careful out there autists

TLDR: GME TO VALHALLA. Rest of the market, potentially to the depths of Avernus soon.

Obligatory 🚀🚀🚀🚀 (yes it’s the fucking name as you know)

Here are some cool bullet points, I don’t have pictures for those who can’t read. :(

Institutional ownership: ~95% (still near IPO price, they won’t sell anytime soon)

RKT has been consolidating for months with a fuck ton of long term investors.

ANECDOTE! I work in the industry and while anyone who does mortgages is up, market share is consistently eaten by the fucking whale that RKT is. Young people people do everything on the internet, and RKT is and has been in the drivers seat with major banks YEARS behind.

SPECULATION! RKT is forming a major partnership and will announce early this year. CEO Jay Farner confirmed this with Jim Cramer late last year. Now, who will the partner be? 

Rumor is that this person is Warren Buffet. He was granted an exemption not to disclose his position with the SEC last quarter as he seeks to build a larger position. He slashed his bank stocks last year, but loves banking/insurance businesses. He has a real estate behemoth and it would make total sense for them and RKT to partner.

 Also, Blackrock has acquired a 7% stake announced yesterday. 

Also, lockup expired yesterday...no one is fucking selling or has sold!

FuNdAmEnTals: P/E ratio is fucking 3.
Best retention rate in the industry (duh), minimal risk in a housing decline as they don’t hold their mortgages, they sell them to Fannie/Freddie (backed by the Government).

Sure maybe not a “tech valuation” but this should be a triple digit stock, if not this year then in the next few. If buffet does get in then this will be $100 pretty quickly.

Looking forward: this company is expected to blow out earnings this month as they continue to gain market share (as they are at least 5 years ahead of major competition), plus they have 2 super bowl ads this weekend.

If you are looking to be a ground floor person and not a chaser this is your opportunity.

TLDR: I buy $RKT, you should buy $RKT, make some tendies, and maybe you’ll get a blowjob or two from your wife or husband for being smart.

2. Buy the shares they need to deliver by TODAY for all the calls that were exercised Friday at the lo

**How many of the sales today will turn out to be failures to deliver?** They're literally selling fake shares right now to drive the price down and we're not going to believe their BS! They're eventually going to have to pay back these shares and we're going to make them pay OUR price for them.

48,GME,l9o3vs,2021-01-31 23:43:34,"You are being played: Citadel and Point72--major hedge funds and investors in Melvin--own tons of AMC, NOK, and BB. The only squeeze that hurts them is GME 🚀","***Edit as of May 27th, 2021***: I posted this back in something like January of this year. Stop commenting on it. Of course things have changed since then. But the price action you saw in AMC today was not shorts covering, it was options driven. Take a look at call volume today. 






The punchline: Citadel and Point72 own shit tons of AMC, BB, and NOK, and presumably want them to increase.

&#x200B;

I've found it somewhat suspicious that most accounts saying to buy/hold AMC, NOK, and to a degree BB are new. In addition, when each of these stocks started getting promoted here, other than GME (which was pretty much all that was talked about at the time) we were still almost exclusively an options subreddit. It took forever for most of us retards to learn that shares were important for GME as a special case, but all of the support for AMC, NOK, and to a degree BB was/is about holding shares, which was grounds to get booted to r/investing prior to GME. We're wallstreet*bets* after all. We trade high-risk options and share in our love of excruciatingly erotic loss porn. The people promoting AMC, NOK, and BB didn't/don't seem to fit in with their recommendations of shares. So I decided to look into this more.

&#x200B;

After being reminded by Cramer's video that hedge funds will often manipulate sentiment premarket by pushing the stock up and then slowly dumping it, I decided to look into a premarket comparison of GME and AMC on a random recent day. As you can see below, GME and AMC are both pumped up premarket, but by open GME has been shorted down (and it pops up) whereas AMC is in the stratosphere and falls sharply once everyone in the market is trading freely:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zgykmt8mqqe61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=eeae992d385ba8529a99e2558b270146099f7646

This seems like they may be trying to manipulate GME and AMC in opposite ways. This premarket activity can make people pile into non-GME stocks if it looks like GME peaked and others haven't. I haven't looked at BB or NOK, but my guess is that we'd see a similar divergence between GME and those stocks in after hours/premarket as well. 

&#x200B;

Most importantly, Citadel and Point72 are long on BB, AMC, and NOK. 

# BB

[According to 13F filings](https://fintel.io/so/us/bb), Citadel owns a whopping 1,068,700 shares of BB, and Point72 owns 519,200 shares. No options are owned by either fund. Point72 and Citadel clearly profit from BB's rise.

# AMC

[According to 13F filings](https://fintel.io/so/us/amc) (Ctrl+F citadel or point72), Citadel owns 292,926 shares of, call options on, and put options on AMC, and Point72 owns 21,758 shares. It's not possible to know what options strategy (e.g., long straddle) Citadel has in play, but it's clear Point72 and Citadel have both benefited from AMC's enormous increase. 

# NOK

[According to 13F filings](https://fintel.io/so/us/nok), Citadel owns an enormous 2,950,823 shares of, call options on, and put options on NOK, and Point72 does not own shares of NOK. It's not possible to know what options strategy (e.g., long straddle) Citadel has in play, but it's clear Citadel has benefited from NOK's rise.

&#x200B;

We already learned this morning that Citadel owns a humongous stake in silver, so that is most likely being shilled too. Importantly, if any of these funds sell off AMC, BB, NOK, or silver during their increase, they all have more capital to short GME with.

***The only stock increase that really hurts either of these funds or Melvin is GME*****.** *These funds shorted a viable and successful company to 140%. I know I would prefer to specifically focus on hedge funds that seem to have knowingly engaged in illegal naked shorting (Melvin, probably), appear to have forced Robinhood to stop allowing purchase orders (Citadel, Robinhood's primary financer), or are literally run by people who have been convicted of securities fraud (Point72).*

&#x200B;

# Why did AMC, BB, or NOK get restricted too, then?

The question remains as to why all of these stocks were restricted by many brokers at around the same time as GME. My belief is that purchases on these stocks were restricted in order to make them look like they were stocks that these hedge funds didn't want us to buy. Alternatively, *some* hedge funds are short these other stocks, so it's possible that they were having liquidity issues that also affected the market. But, like I mentioned above, I'd prefer to focus on hurting hedge funds engaging in illegal activities.

&#x200B;

**TLDR:** hedge funds profit off of your buying AMC, BB, and NOK calls/shares. These stocks seem to be shilled on here as alternatives to GME to distract us. Unless you want to line the pockets of Citadel, Point72, and indirectly Melvin, stay away from AMC, BB, and NOK. **BUY AND HOLD GME IF YOU WANT TO REALLY HURT THESE ASSHOLES. GME TO THE MOON 🚀🚀🚀🚀**

I'll keep it short and sweet. $NOK is almost certainly a fucking plant, meant to bait you all into buying.

- High float, low price, perfect for retail to pile into
- It's not shorted much at all
- People only started mentioning it *very* recently last week. Out of the non-GME recent meme stocks ($AMC, $BB, $NOK), it's the most recent.
- Retail has gotten fucked on $NOK in the past
- The 5G thesis is great, but it's old fucking news

But OK, all the stuff above is more or less conjecture, let's assume I'm 100% wrong as an unreformed 🌈🐻 (still think that market crash is coming BTW), here's some signal [take another look at the stocks that Robinhood has restricted and how severe the restriction is](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-due-to-recent-market-volatility/) (as of 1/30):

| Symbol | Allowed Share purchases | Allowed Option Purchases |
|---|----|---|
| $GME | 1 | 5 (minimum of any of them) |
| $AMC | 1 | 10 |
| $BB | 1 | 10 | 
| $NOK | 5 | 10 | 

Which one of these is not like the other? $NOK is basically the least restricted (on both dimensions). I'm personally not super convinced on $BB either but meh.

Just like most other posts on WSB, this is not financial advice. Make your own investment decisions and know when to sell, because when the squeeze ends it will end fast -- make sure you and your friends talk about and exit strategy, we want to sell into Melvin, Citadel, and their friends, not each other. Once liquidity hits zero it would be great if someone started a count of how many shares were bought at the elevated prices.

I will echo something I read in another post here -- for all the 4MM new people here, **WSB LOSES MONEY ON AVERAGE**. We post and celebrate loss porn. $GME is the only safe bet right now, it will be green even in a sea of red because what's happening right now is mechanical, assured. The shorts have not completely covered yet, and they will. It's not about fundamentals, it's not about technicals, it is market mechanics.

[EDIT] People in the comments suggesting I haven't been on this sub long enough to understand why each individual stock is squeezing. Let me lay it out (please let me know if I'm wrong) so people stop suggesting that

- $GME rocketed because short squeeze + gamma squeeze
- $AMC rocketed because short squeeze + gamma squeeze + recent 900M cash infusion, Bankruptcy is 100% off the table
- $BB rocketed because of optimism around security, lack of compromise in Solarwinds
- $NOK rocketed because 5G, and some idea of being under valued (this one I admit I don't understand)

Shut the fuck up about it. If you know the above this post isn't for you.

This post exists to *dispel the fiction that half of these are legitimate short and/or gamma squeezes*. If you thought that $BB and $NOK were short squeezes, YOU ARE WRONG. They *MIGHT* gamma squeeze but certainly not with the restrictions on them.

[EDIT 2] It looks like people are still confused about brokers. There are three brokers that I can recommend, if you're trying to express a view on this market:

- Fidelity
- Vanguard
- TD Ameritrade ([see their restrictions](https://www.tdameritrade.com/td-ameritrade-trading-restrictions-stocks.page))

If you're thinking ""You're a fucking plant, how could you recommend TD Ameritrade?"", calm your tits. I have been posting since last week about the *actual* restrictions that are in on TD Ameritrade, fucking read them -- **you *CAN* buy $GME and $GME calls on TD**. The media misreported and never actually listed what the restrictions were for TD (they were one of the first to restrict).

NOTE: I DO NOT KNOW IF TD WILL CHANGE IN THE FUTURE, SO THE SAFEST ARE FIDELITY AND VANGUARD.

Also, I will shill for TD a bit -- when I dumped RH last year because they cost me money, I moved to TD and they forced me to do their education stuff on options and shares and futures before being approved for level 2 options (I'm not a fan of lying on my applications to financial institutions). I actually really fucking enjoyed it and learned a lot. I don't know how they're going to change since they merged with Chuck Schwab, and you could say that all their ""education"" schtick is actually just bullshit to convince you that you know what you're doing *before* you give the big boys your money, but I really like TD.

See my previous comments about TD's actual restrictions from when I called them, on the phone, like a boomer:

And when you're done with GME, it's time to punish the big banks who have been suppressing the price of silver since the Bear Stearns / JPM merge. It's all in fucking Bloomberg:

There's an excellent explanation of their scheme here

You think GME squeezed hard? Look what happened to silver half a year ago in July:

https://preview.redd.it/3yssvdm7y1e61.png?width=2588&format=png&auto=webp&s=25d4cfa973d57f1f6083affdcecf6b35e4055a7f

That's one of the banks getting squeezed out of silver, having to cover their shorts... and that's just because rich boomers freaked out about financial instability and finally started calling out the Comex on their bullshit, and taking physically delivery of silver... which they don't have.

Now imagine 4 million degenerates buying $SLV, forcing the trust to take delivery of physical silver from the Comex. This isn't GME, who's fair price is maybe around $5 a share. The FAIR price of silver based on the historical gold/silver ratio is almost surely over $50/ounce. This short squeeze will be a fantastic success even if we can take silver to it's fair market value.

And then there's $AG. Because once silver starts moving, $AG is going to go to the fucking moon. 1) it's a leverage play on silver, 2) It's got it's OWN SHORTS TO BE SQUEEZED OUT. At least a 23% short float as of last count: [https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AG.htm](https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AG.htm)

# Previous Important Posts

* [EndGame Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/) (DTC Infinity) covered the short positions, the float, and potential snowball impacts of increasing prices, and argued that part of the reason that shorts haven’t closed was that it was pretty much impossible for shorts to close
* [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/) covered Cohen, fair market cap analysis, and potential investors, in which I talked about the amazing mid-to-long term potential for GME.
* After the Citron tweet, I shared this [fan fiction on what looked like blatant market manipulation by shorts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/) on the day of the tweet, and offered some education on strengthening your position. This one got buried and is worth reading.

# What’s happened thus far

## Why did GME go up on Friday?

The story here is more complex than paid media articles would like you to believe. GME has been driven up by 3 different forces:

* Organic buying
   * There is a mixture of growing positive sentiment in the investor world (not just WSB) about GME’s future
   * There’s been a lot of good due diligence shared not just on WSB but even outside (for example, see gmedd.com)
   * The Citron Backfire
      * Shorts were on the ropes and kept looking for hail mary’s. They went to Citron and [coordinated a dump](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/) to try to bring the price down.
      * However, this backfired. Citron is so disliked in the industry that new wealth poured into GME in the face of Andrew Left’s pleas. Even when Benzinga brought Andrew Left on air, **minutes after he left** [they bought shares live on their show](https://youtu.be/mFiFWBrE5DE?t=5104)**.**
      * The next day, our very on u/Uberkikz11 [was on Benzinga](https://youtu.be/GLzTU87MJMM?t=837) and more shares were bought.
   * Larger investors piling in
      * In my [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/), I hypothesized that we’d soon see larger investors pile in. Then, on WSB, we saw posts from a [venture capitalist](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0yzb5/a_venture_capital_perspective_on_gme/) as well as a [hedge fund investor](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2zk5e/a_hedge_fund_managers_perspective_on_gme/)
* Gamma squeeze
   * Once the organic buying started, we rolled into a gamma squeeze. Many people written about the gamma squeeze so I won’t repeat, see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2t9bf/gme_i_think_this_is_a_gamma_squeeze_where_dealers/) for an example.
* Ultra low liquidity - In EndGame part 1, I talked about how the actual actively traded shares are much lower than the reported float, and **share availability has been reducing** driven by lots of diamond hands, not just among smaller guys like us but the larger folks too.
* I believe there were some short covers on Friday, but Ortex was still estimating 71M shares short at the eod.

However, not many people have talked about why it **went down**

## Why did GME come down?

Here’s where things got interesting for me, and something I think happened again today (Monday) when GME climbed up over 100% but then had a rapid reversal, closing 20% above yesterday but closing below open.

So Friday looked like a slam dunk - gamma squeeze, no shorts available to short, puts were getting exceedingly expensive as a short tactic. What happened?

This is my fan fiction, based on what I saw.

**I believe** [**market-makers**](https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse/membership) **took a non-neutral stance and began actively shorting the stock after the second halt.**

Market-makers are responsible for maintaining liquidity and functioning in the stock market, but they also have abilities that others don’t - for example they are legally allowed to naked short for “liquidity purposes”. They also have the ability to halt trading.

There were two halts in the day on Friday: First, when GME was up 69% (heh heh), and then a few minutes later when it kept climbing after the first halt was relaxed. Note that at the time of the first halt, the **bid-ask spread was $10 on the underlying** a huge signal that there just were not enough shares to buy.

However, after the second halt, something strange happened. Whereas a few minutes prior, there were no sellers willing to sell their shares below $75, **within 15 minutes** after the halt there were sellers at 70, 65, 60, and 56. Where did these sellers come from?

&#x200B;

[Incredible momentum reversal on Friday 1\/22 to push the price not too far above the 60c strike price. ](https://preview.redd.it/tt5zodp6pkd61.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa22980543213227bf5b3d17166129ac6cb65a65)

My speculation? This was a coordinated **naked short ladder attack**. In this type of attack, short seller A sells to short seller B, who then turns around to short seller A at a lower price, etc. and with a **very small amount of capital** you can wreck the momentum of a stock and make people think that others are running for the exits.

Notice how the stock dropped from a high of $75 on Friday to below 60 - the highest expiring SP for the 1/22 options, and stayed tight in range for the rest of the day. Now, for compliance reasons, MM are required to be neutral by EOD, so 20 minutes before close, MMs had to buy back all their short positions, which led to the strong close above 60.

All this led me to believe that the **real fair market price for GME was above $65.** Without the market makers interference, GME would have closed higher.

## A repeat on Monday

The short ladder attack repeated on Monday.

GME opened strong above $90, and quickly climbed to **a high above $155** before it was halted, immediately after the halt, a **short ladder attack again** drove the price down

&#x200B;

[Dejavu - Incredible Momentum Reversal after trading halts. ](https://preview.redd.it/qm81rd0dpkd61.png?width=637&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b4563e7dd2e626fb09dca69668c24631932e707)

Both days, there **were rapid and significant reversals in momentum.**

Now, I kept wondering - why would MM’s take the side of the shorts? What’s in it for them? One theory was that they were not adequately hedged, with the low liquidity of the stock meaning that the price was moving up too fast for them to acquire the shares they needed to.

But then the news hit today:

# A new opponent enters the ring:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8htb0scgpkd61.png?width=926&format=png&auto=webp&s=228a8a84e592ea4642a61c5e07e07ae344ac8f2c

That’s right, the **same Citadel** [**listed by the NYSE as one of their designated market makers**](https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse/membership) is now invested in Melvin’s hedge fund and has a financial interest in the direction of GME’s share price.

**Hey media - you want a manipulation story? You’re missing the big one.**

# Now what?

Shorts have pulled new dirty tactics each time they’ve been pushed to the edge. Paid media attacks, Citron’s fluff tweet + coordinated shorting, and now they’ve got the **actual people who get all the order flow on their side.**

On the other hand, GME is still up over 20% and now trading at $88.00 after hours, which is well above the previous day’s high.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rr5qet4ipkd61.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=96d28bf446a714906712503726f5903a681d5368

What this tells me is that GME’s **true price is still being suppressed**. They are using every tactic possible, even changing the [bid-ask spread rules](https://thefly.com/permalinks/entry.php/id3233043/GME;IRBT-NYSE-changes-bidask-differentials-on-options-for-GameStop-iRobot) on options to specifically target retail’s buying of options.

We’re now playing the game against the folks who write the rules of the game.

Some shorts may have covered today - with prices below $60 at one point they had some great opportunities to. However, there is **no way all of the shorts who need to exit covered today.**

The short position still lost 20% from yesterday. They’ve got more fingers in the dam, but it’s definitely cracking. Also, **every call option purchased prior to 1/25 is ITM and profitable,** while **every put option purchased prior to 1/25 is OTM.**

And, for some reason, the SEC still doesn’t want to enforce the threshold securities list for GME, where it’s now **been on for more than 30 days in a highly covered “short squeeze”.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rbrf6khjpkd61.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e4f432ff02dbf475a03cc68c54a5a0f5f0de429

# Margin impacts:

Note that at this point, most brokers have increased margin on GME. This means that people that are long or short on margin will need to put up capital to hold their positions.

This also means **puts will get more expensive** as people who sell puts will have to maintain 100% of the notional in their accounts to secure the put, so MMs will have fewer retail sellers of puts to absorb the demand.

That means it’s not a bad idea to sell puts to acquire shares if you’re aiming for the long-term and not the squeeze, but keep in mind you’ll need the exact same capital as if you’d bought the shares, so it’s up to you on this.

For shorts, a margin increase while the price is moving against you (even with retracements) is no good.

# My speculation

* Cohen and the GME board have been strangely silent this entire run. It’s possible they can’t say anything at all during the pre-earnings quiet period, but I’m sure they can see what’s happening.
* MMs will continue to play dirty, but at the same time they will need to continue to need to buy GME shares to delta hedge 1/29 and later ITM options as we get closer to expiry.

# Things to be careful about

As you can see, this is no easy win. I've been in GME for a few months but I've seen almost every trick in the book. In addition to the [suggestions I wrote about in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/), here’s some things to be careful about.

* **Be careful about swapping ITM calls for OTM calls:** it can be tempting to trade-up your options for higher return, but be mindful of the delta impact. You may actually be driving the sale of shares by MMs when you don’t mean to. For example, if you sell a .5 delta call for 2 .2 delta calls, that’s net reduction of 10 shares that MMs have to hold long as leverage.
* **Be careful about being short any calls this week:** Not only do you limit your upside (which is dumb in the prospect of a squeeze), you could end up in a nightmare scenario. A call that ends OTM on Friday could end up ITM after hours if you didn’t sell it, and you may get assigned while the underlying continues to go up.
* **There are a few other dirty tactics shorts can play.** I’m not specifically going to share them here because I don’t want to give the ideas circulation, but
   * **Choose your own limit sells based on personal sell points.** Don’t copy others and don’t try to be memey. Make your own decisions.
   * **Stop sharing your positions publicly.** I know this is anti-wsb, and I think sharing them is great for this community, but in the case of GME it’s an **attack vector** for you.
* **Be careful of holding weeklies until expiration.** Remember the multiple trading halts? What if trading gets halted on Friday at 2pm and doesn’t resume for the rest of the day? **All your 1/29 calls would expire worthless. Depending on your broker and your cash positions, maybe even your ITM ones.** Roll (or sell, if you’re taking profits) your weeklies well before expiration.
* **Be careful about buying on margin.** Brokers are rapidly increasing margins. If you bought on margin with 2:1 leverage, and the stock went up 100%, you’d be in margin call even without a margin change. If the broker moves margin against you, you’ll get to margin call faster.
* **Don’t bet more than you can afford to lose.** I’ve been in GME long enough to know that just when you think going up is a sure thing (remember last Monday with the short sale restriction?), you can be surprised by a new trick. If you bet it all on weeklies all at once, you may not be able to recover from being wrong on the timing. Consider longer expiry or spreading your purchases out. I’ve held through multiple 30-40% drawdowns in the underlying; and **held through a 50% drawdown today**, so you need to be ready for the volatility.
* **Watch out for stop loss hunts.** It’s common practice for shorts to hunt for stop losses for cheap shares. If you’ve set a stop loss, be really sure about it.

This is not financial advice; do your own DD. I’m holding over $1M in shares and calls.

# 1/26 Update

Hi everyone. Sorry for not posting or replying to comments. I was auto-banned from WSB when this post was auto-deleted by the auto-mod. Thanks to u/zjz to reversing the auto-deletion of the post though as it looked like it was helpful to the community.  

Hope you all made a ton of money today!

**Quick Notes:**

* At an after-hours price of **$209 a share**, **every call option, for every expiry, for every strike price is in-the-money. This is the third time this has happened for GME recently.** Amazing. What this means now is that market makers will need to buy a lot of shares to hedge for the calls expiring this week. Heed my above warnings. 
* At this price, shorts **will start to get liquidated.** Combining the 400% weekly gain with the margin requirements increasing across the board, brokers will force close short positions. Starting maybe with the small guys, but it will cause a ripple effect. **Things could move fast.** Some funds may get additional bailouts this week to hold out. 
* **You need to decide your own exit.** Only you know how much $ you're playing with, how much you're willing to lose, how important the $ is to you, etc. **Minimize you're regret, don't maximize your profits.** If you are thinking about taking profits this week, spread out your sells so you don't kick yourself over timing things poorly. Personally, I think we are in **unprecedented territory** and that there's no way all of the shorts have exited already, so we're not done. I could be wrong. See EndGame part 1. 
* **Close spreads.** With every call ITM, you are at the risk of early-assignment. If you don't watch closely, you could be hit with sky-high hard-to-borrow fees and get killed on what you thought was a profitable trade. 
* **Watch for ripple effects. This is already happening.** When funds get liquidated, they have to buy back all their other shorts (see AMC, BBBY) and sell their longs (look at BABA after-hours). Want to play GME without playing GME? Maybe throw a little $ at BBBY. You do you. 
* In EndGame Part 2, I talked about potential investors, and how the higher price is gonna attract the bigger $. Today we saw Chamath, Winklevoss, and others. And then Elon tweeted and simultaneously stimulated the buying frenzy and scared the crap out of shorts. I'm just gonna copy what I said about this potentiality
   * ***Elon****: (Least likely, completely improbable, but cataclysmic event). Elon hates shorts. Elon, with TSLA, went through the pain that GME is going through. TSLA almost went bankrupt because shorts were pushing the price down so it was difficult to raise the cash they needed to survive. Sound familiar?* ***Elon’s wealth swings more in a day than GME is worth in entirety.*** *Elon could* ***buy all the fucking float of GME with what he makes in 8 hours****. One call from fellow entrepreneur and* [*aspiring twitter-meme-god*](https://twitter.com/ryancohen) *would absolutely wreck the game.*

1. ***If you are short gamestop****, you are one meme purchase by the richest man in the world away from a fucking cataclysmic event. ""Hey son, I heard you like games. So I bought you gamestop. All of it."" 🚀*

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lail27/tlry_dd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

I’m returning today to inform everyone about how the $TLRY and $APHA merger happening Q2 will work. 

Based on the terms of the merger, $APHA owners will receive 83% of their $APHA shares as $TLRY stock. For all you smooth brains, this means that $APHA should be 83% of whatever $TLRY stock price is on a given day. This is currently not the case.

I have predicted that $TLRY will moon based on short interest and other DD. Link above. This means that $APHA is discounted and will follow this move. So smart money will buy $APHA to take advantage of this discount along with the impending moon of $TLRY.

36mil in volume is not a lot! These guys shorted around $5 so unless the stock hits $5 you're fine. Even then, you're fine if we don't sell. Don't be paper handed. Most retailers are still holding.

This is a once in a lifetime chance. Red is just a color, it will change if you hold and buy the dip. I plan on buying more near end of day myself!

**The short itself will probably happen after Thursday Feb. 4th.** This is because that would be the 13th consecutive day of Failure to Deliver on a threshold security. But this only happens if the shorts can't deliver the shares they owe. They're trying to illegally drive the price down so when they buy back they can avoid a squeeze. I'm a literal retard, but I have a feeling the price is gonna start going back up on Thursday or next week. Maybe someone can explain more

**Retail investors own over 100% of the actual shares. This means the price goes as high as we want it to go. It will keep climbing until we sell. They are using every trick in the book because they know they're f*cked! This is literally free money if we all hold. There is nothing they can do but try to scare you.**

I sold my meager 40 shares like a paper handed bitch a few days ago, but have seen the error of my ways and I've been buying back in. I'm going to buy over 40 shares this time to make up for it. HOOOOOLD.

Lastly, remember to remove your stop losses so you don't sell!

For SEC interns, this is not financial advice. Idk what I'm talking about. I like the stock. Ryan Cohen is great.

**EDIT:** [More on the whole 13 consecutive days bit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/layb2c/cutting_through_fud/)

They just upgraded a few areas and rolled the rest into profit. No one got called out on it, no one got fined.

Now the USA is behind the world in connectivity and speed. 

The pandemic has forced millions of Americans to work from home, Comcast, Time Warner, Cox, etc... say hmmm DATA CAPS.

COD is like 120G now(I probably exaggerated but it feels like it)? Damn, one game, 2 or 3 movies and some zoom meetings, and BAM data cap.

That one game was half my data cap, and it was just an UPDATE?

We all buy physical (I stopped buying digital games on my console 3 months ago because of data caps). In 30 years people collect these anyway like gameboy cartridges. 

Chewy has a market cap of close to 43b $. That's dogs and cat. I dont know but RC can take GME this way. 

Gaming is a 12b/y growth, and only growing more. 

In 5 years GME is worth 60B market cap (or more). That's  $860/share. I'll give my shares to these guys for 10x now, or just hold them for 5 years. 

$8600 is my value Today. 
You can have my shares for that price.

109,GME,lb7ndd,2021-02-02 22:52:35,GME liquidy is drying up - causing the share to become more and more volatile,"[https://i.imgur.com/DxM4SwP.png](https://i.imgur.com/DxM4SwP.png)

I've borrowed and dumbed down this chart from [this savant's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l97jbo/gamestop_big_picture_market_mechanics/).

As the free-flowing stock dries up (due to ppl buying and holding), the volatility increases. It becomes easier and easier to move the needle with less money. As long as you keep holding and buying, the volatility will only increase. **Expect huge swings in the next few days.**

Hedge funds know this. They tanked the stock this morning. Right now they intentionally leveling the demand to keep the stock price stable; to make it look like the ride is over.

HOWEVER

The short float is still high, and the [volume has been steadily decreasing](https://i.imgur.com/eRH3S2b.png).

Furthermore, [institutional ownership](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/institutional-holdings) only picked up about 12m shares, and some of those went to institutions that were long not short. Now maybe I'm misreading this, or maybe they're fudging the data, but I just don't see how the shorts covered their position with this measly volume.

|ACTIVE POSITIONS|HOLDERS|SHARES|
|:-|:-|:-|
|New positions|46|12,880,726|
|Sold out positions|34|3,412,841|

\--

Keep in mind the VW squeeze happened with far less short-interest than is currently in GME. The main problem is that retail investors, unlike huge firms, can't vacuum up all the supply fast enough, which enables the hf to slowly wiggle their way out buying up paper hands. They've likely exited their worst short positions and reshorted at a better price.

Some people are saying the squeeze might be more of a slow gradual upward pressure, rather than a sudden event. The truth is that the hedge funds are walking on a tightrope, and this stock is still extremely volatile. Any big movements in demand can drastically impact the price.

\------

Disclaimer: I am a poker player, not a day trader.  In poker, this is what we call an ""implied odds play"". The risk is relatively small for us bulls (relative to the short position), but the expected value is potentially huge if it works.  But these plays are still risky despite being +EV. **You have to be prepared to ride the swings and embrace the variance.**

*This is pure, uneducated speculation, not financial advice.*

**TL/DR: Grit your teeth and brace for swings. Shit's about to get nuts.**

110,GME,l6eqqu,2021-01-27 22:25:53,People will try to gaslight you into believing that playing $GME is wrong or something to be ashamed of. But keep the following in mind...,"Inevitably, there will be a smear campaign led by certain organizations and media members against retail traders who are getting in on $GME. One argument that will be made is that it's not fair that we made so much money by recognizing that a group of hedge funds and institutions were in over their heads. It hurts the market and we should feel bad for exploiting them.

The total market cap of $GME is around $12B as I'm writing this. **The total market cap of Wall Street is around $50T.** That means we've currently displaced about .025% of the total value of the US stock market. I will type that out to reiterate: we (retail traders) have displaced approximately one quarter of one tenth of one percent of the total market cap. To claim that we are doing anything which is tremendously harmful to the whole market is absolutely pants-on-fire lies. Is this going to change some elements of the market moving into the future? Almost certainly. But even if this stock goes to $1000 per share, we are still only talking about less than one tenth of one percent of the total market cap that's out there. 

If you're looking at your RH balance right now  and thinking ""wow, that's a lot of money, am I doing something wrong? Illegal, even?"" the answer is **ABSOLUTELY NOT.** What you are beginning to notice is that the wealth gap in this country is absolutely massive. Thousands upon thousands of people could make year changing or life changing money out of this squeeze and it'll hardly be a blip on Wall Street's radar. Greed is absolutely out of control at the top and this funny little news story is tangible proof of that. Do not let them gaslight you into thinking that it's wrong for you to get a slightly larger sliver of the pie. 

Good luck to everyone playing this. I've got 100 shares at a cost basis of $103.95. I might not make millions, but I might be able to make a dent in my student loans, or pay off my car, or something that makes me just a little more hopeful that I'll be able to live some sort of ""American Dream"" before I'm old and wrinkled.

edit: and in the event that you're literally brand new to trading (we're getting a lot of new people here), I would highly encourage you to read up on investment basics (there are literally millions of resources on this) and do some research into $GME and why it's moving the way it is. I would not recommend taking a position on any stock if you can't articulate your own reason as to why you're invested in it.",Discussion,0.99

127,A,l2zk5e,2021-01-23 00:09:53,A hedge fund managers perspective on GME,"I am a hedge fund manager (long-short, derivative mixed equity fund primarily value focused with some growth). In the past we have been value holders of GME three other times and started a small position today nears it's intraday high and will likely add to this next week should the stock fall.   Previously all my Reddit comments have involved my e-Skate collection or my landing of my airplane in challenging conditions (see: [https://youtu.be/Rn7XoYKlZl0](https://youtu.be/Rn7XoYKlZl0)) However, I can't resist commenting on the fascinating technical factors that likely will continue to propel this issue higher - perhaps significantly so over the next few weeks.  Andrew Left's mocking derision of retail investors may prove to be his waterloo.  Why would a value focused fund manager buy a stock that based on classic fundamental value analysis appears significantly overvalued?  

GME appears to be a very interesting example of individual stock reflexivity.  What is reflexivity you ask?  This is the theory, originally promoted by George Soros that the stock market itself can cause the economy to either rise of fall (as opposed to the classic teaching that the economy affects the stock market).  An example of market reflexivity would be the great depression whereby a crashed market brought down an economy that was only in an ordinary recession, or the recent improvement in the economy, not withstanding Covid, which has followed a rising market.  In GME's case the rise in the stock price itself will likely result in fundamental improvements to the underlying economic metrics of the company.  Why?

1. As the price of the stock rises, GME finds itself in the enviable position where it can use it's stock at currency to buy complementary businesses it could not otherwise afford - monetization of the current short squeeze by the enterprise will lead to fundamentally higher revenue and profits of the enterprise should they find good strategic acquisitions to further monetize their large retail customer base (which has real and to date largely untapped value).  The company is likely right now on the hunt for a major acquisition that could fundamentally alter the companies future prospects with that acquisition largely paid for on the back of short seller covering.
2. Monetization of the short covering increase in share price via issue of a secondary .   The $500 million in debt (net of cash) the company currently has could be entirely extinguished with a secondary that is dilutive of only 10% of the equity base.  In fact such a secondary will, despite this dilution, likely result in a significant price rise for the stock (versus the usual fall in price after most, but not all, secondaries).  Bankruptcy risk will largely be eliminated with this secondary as will interest rate risk and financing costs ultimately increasing cash flow per share.  A 20% secondary will leave the company in a strong cash positive position with this cash available for expansion of sales efforts, cloud offerings, acquisitions, etc.
3. Directly increased sales and revenue by virtue of the large amount of attention this epic short squeeze has brought to the company.  I suspect most long retail stockholders have explored the companies web offerings and are considering becoming customers.  This is free advertising to people with money who are tech savvy and the exact demographic GME would target with paid advertising.  
4. Retention and efforts of existing management now becomes easy.  Every manager there wants to see this continue.  Operations at companies with sinking share prices typically suffer as management and employees leave the enterprise or develop anger and lassitude (think Sears Holdings).   The opposite is occurring here with every manager trying to beat their numbers to see the squeeze continue.
5. This issue remains extremely heavily shorted.  Despite the squeeze that has already occurred, other ""value"" based investors have dived into short positions as the price has risen.  The short positions of this issue appears (although I can't be certain) to exceed 100% with all available shares already lent out from marginal accounts and probably a lot of naked shorting going on as well.  Although I don't yet have the current data on todays short position, I can say for certain the stock remains very heavily shorter, perhaps more so now than at any previous time.  Today, I called my broker asking about the availability of shares to short and the borrow costs.  We have one of the larger accounts at our brokers firm and I was able to speak directly to the ""hard to borrow"" desk.  No borrowable shares are available at any broker, anywhere, at this time, even for high borrow costs or even from other brokers.  This extreme short against a small common float, made more extreme no-doubt by naked shorting, could end very poorly for those short this issue.  As they are forced to close out their positions, the stock will continue to rise and continue to exacerbate the positive effects the rising price has on the above 4 issues.

Impossible to know really where the stock goes from here as there does currently exist a disconnect from fundamentals. However, the extreme short position against the unrestricted common float here suggests to me there is a much greater chance of GME's price continuing to increase, perhaps significantly so, and this chance is far greater than the now fearful pundit in hiding's proclamation that the stock would soon see $20.

For what it's worth, over the past 13 years of this funds life, we have significantly beaten both the overall market and the dow,  (12.2%/year margin over DJIA inclusive of dividends since 2008).  We  have had plenty of losing issues despite this beat but also way more big winners, some really big.  Right now my money's with the retail investors who are long GME.  We only have a small position here but this may prove a big winner for us also.  Cheers.",Discussion,0.97

They are actually trying to do the same with silver because banks have a massive net short position, proof included.

[This shows](https://twitter.com/Laowai_Koala/status/1356603457424171015?s=20) the massive net short position that banks have in the silver futures market.  And if you want to look it up yourself you can [right here.](https://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/BankParticipationReports/deajan21f)

Wait, banks are massively short silver in the futures market?  Yes

Your title bashed silver though? Yes, it’s the only way to post about silver right now. Forgive me WSB gods.

You want me to sell GME and go into silver? No. Hold your GME and go to the moon if that’s your play.  While GME is the current religious level obsession of WSB, there are people who are still interested in other plays. We’re not your enemy, WSB used to be a place where people could pitch all kinds of trades and bulls and bears made fun of each other but didn’t try to ban one another. 

There is a lot of disinformation going around that somehow silver is being pushed to help the hedge funds and banks recover losses from GME or something, but that directly conflicts with their massive net short interest in the silver futures market.

Further, silver has gapped down several times over the past year and there was never a peep from regulators.  Over the weekend all physical silver bullion from retailers completely sold out and Monday saw silver massively gap up. That night the CFTC raised margin requirements and today silver plunged. 

When it’s speculative longs buying silver and banks shorting silver, it’s the longs who were forced to sell today when margin requirements were raised.  Banks have essentially unlimited liquidity so a margin raise doesn’t affect them like it does speculators who are individuals.  

This is why for the short squeeze to work we need futures traders who won’t use their margin to max out long positions. Drastically cut back your leverage or don’t use it at all. Hold the cash you need to actually buy the silver at expiration, and then take physical delivery.  The shorts won’t be able to get enough silver to satisfy the contracts and will be left scrambling and silver prices absolutely soaring.

The silver short squeeze is an entirely different animal than GME, but it’s pretty obvious from the public data on net positioning by banks, and the immediate regulator action to the surge in price, that this is another case of retail vs corrupt wall st. banks.  

Silver surfers are fighting the same battle you are but in a different market and with bigger opponents. The trade appeals to a broader audience than just WSB though as there are doomer boomers who have been ranting and raving about this day for the last 2 decades who are also willing to dump their money into exposing the silver futures market for the fraud that it is.",Discussion,0.81

Listen up retards,

I know BlAcKbErRy make phones is a solid meme, but I think it is actually a very worthwhile investment regardless of the current hype (or lack thereof) around the stock.

BlackBerry Spark was launched just earlier last year and so far is winning some decent contracts. I think it has plenty of room to grow. As governments and countries start to connect more with the internet due to covid or just technology advancing cybersecurity solutions will be more relevant. I think BB has positioned itself to be a solid choice.

The United States Airforce in September selected BlackBerry Spark “for their secure productivity needs.”

Samsung Knox uses BlackBerry Spark

They “won” the patent infringement lawsuit against Facebook, so that payout should be coming at some point. I know the stock already jumped because of the news, but still being able to uphold their patents means in the future they can sue more people for infringement and make more money.

Blackberry is out of the cell phone game which is good for them I think their software and security was really what made the phones popular to begin with so now they can focus more on that. (Also they are the largest patent holders in Canada not sure if that a really that important though)

Blackberry and Baidu have teamed up to work on autonomous cars in China

Automotive companies fuck with QNX (article is outdated) they say its in 175 million cars now

Also the deal with Amazon.

Also I think the CEO is very motivated to make it work with 5 million in shares being locked up until the stock can reach $16-20 over a 10-day trading average. Also the sweet sweet $90 mill if he can get the stock to $30 before November of 2023.

While I don’t think its going to be the rocketship I wanted it to be (I wanted it to be one so bad look at my comment history lol)  I do think it’s a sound investment and if you buy now you can earn some tidy profits. Earnings call is March 3rd so you autists can buy options for that Friday

But Im just a retarded ape so what do I know.

Not financial advice.

Edit: they have also partnered with Zoom. There is also a blackberry branded 5g phone coming out. (Blackberry isn't the company making it)

Edit2: Saw some talk about Ford ditching QNX but it looks like they will still support Sync (and Apple Car Play) in new cars so not sure how that's going to work

Pay him respect","Y'all probably wondering, how did those manipulative hedgecunts allow us to close above 320. If you note, there were insane volumes during closing, but price remained steady. Because when the hedgecunts where manipulating it to go down and crash, several people found out the technique to buy excercisable calls with almost no premium.

We bypassed the ban on buying more shares and were able to keep the momentum going above 320.

We won the battle, and are well on our way to win the war. Since it closed above 320, millions of calls will be exercised and the gamma squeeze has officially begun. All we have to do now is HOLD. Just chill during this weekend for we have a war to win next week.

I don't know if the technique will work on Monday, and if it does, anyone looking to buy 100 shares or more can do it. Remember to remove stop losses, and set limit higher than 1,000$

Melvie promised the baddest motherfucker on the island he’d give him 14 coconuts (139% short interest).

I’m the meantime, you gathered up 10 coconuts into a bag. MELVIN wants your coconuts bad, or else that mean motherfucker he promised them to will bash his brains in, then throw half his body into a volcano and feed the other half to a shark.

So Melvin and Hedgy want to buy your coconuts from you. It cost you $1 a coconut to get them. 

HERE’S THE BEAR RAID:
So Melvin and Hedgy pass the one 🥥 they have back and forth and say “here, have this for 90 cents”, then “no you take it for 80 cents” all the way down to a penny. Then they turn to look at you, fear in their eyes and piss in their pants and say “see, these are only worth a penny”, praying desperately to whatever god they believe in that you’ll buy it.

ARE YOU BUYING THAT SHIT? 

**NO BECAUSE YOU AREN’T A SUCKER AND YOU HAVE DIAMOND HANDS. AND YOU KNOW YOU CAN CHARGE WHATEVER THE FUCK YOU WANT FOR THOSE THINGS OR ELSE MELVIE IS DONE FOR.**

That’s the bear raid. That’s it. It’s the last price it traded for on low volume. Don’t believe it. It’s the only trick they have and it used to work, but not anymore now that millions of us can communicate and know what’s going on. They think we are so fucking stupid short interest is still over 100% today.

But You know for a fucking fact they have to deliver. 

Shorting costs money. Margin interest isn’t free, and margin gets called and puts expire worthless. Holding your hairy coconuts is free. All you have to do is nothing and they will bleed money until they are forced to pay whatever you want, or they go bust.

„Hello Stinkepimmel,

yesterday was an unprecedented day in the capital markets. The background was mass movements in a few stocks, which resulted in unseen load limits at trading desk partners. In order to ensure trading stability for the majority of the market, we decided to stop accepting buy orders for certain stocks for the time being.

We have lifted this restriction. We apologize for the temporary restriction of your trading freedom.

As a broker, we have extensive requirements for the security, stability and risk management of our platform. These measures exist for your protection as a customer. We take this responsibility seriously and will make adjustments as needed. 

Yesterday's decision was not easy for us: As Trade Republic we stand for free, easy and commission-free access to the capital market. We are thrilled that many millions of people in Europe will be able to participate in the stock markets for the first time in this way. We firmly believe in the regulating power of the markets and the freedom of supply and demand. However, security and reliability for our customers are always at the heart of everything we do.

To be clear, Trade Republic was founded to be a different bank, built by people for people. Trade Republic has no relationships with so-called hedge funds. Trading is done through the stock exchange in Hamburg and is publicly regulated.

We are very happy that you are part of Trade Republic and actively participate in this debate. We listen to your criticism and take it seriously. It is our incentive to become better.
Thank you very much!

189,A,lbchto,2021-02-03 02:46:15,A theory on hedges and a possible squeeze.,"One theory I have been batting around my head. 

Due to the massive losses to the hedges. Why wouldn’t a couple of hedges. Once they have covered. Start massively going long in order to start a massive squeeze to get rid of all the other hedges that are still short. (Still a large short interest) It would only take a small push I think from some big hedges to kickstart the perpetual upward rise.  Retail would join in. The whales are already in.  They would then bail when the squeeze is sqoze and their competition is gone. 

Why would they do this. 
1. It gets rid of the competition 
2. It minimises their losses from the previous shorts. If done right it could actually make them profit. 

Why wouldn’t they do this
1. It would make retail think they won and were right.  Cant have the little guy declaring victory. Is pride more important than money to these despicable miscreants. 

If this is correct then those holding could be rewarded by the hedges.  It would also explain why there was $25m in $800 3/19 calls.

200,GME,l17618,2021-01-20 12:11:14,Citron Research In A Nutshell. $GME holders read.,"Who the fuck is **Citron Research**? Well here’s a fairly precise not too technical guide as to who the fuck these roaches are, so that the average retard on r/wsb with IQ in the -ve range can understand. Listen, english isn’t my first or my second language, i tried my best, suck it up if it ain’t good enough.

**Citron Research** is a shady as fuck stock commentary website operated by Mr. **Andrew Left**. Now a bit on this autist. In short, Andrew’s a 🌈🐻, in long he’s a self proclaimed “*activist short seller*”. He was married to Ms. Andrea Left, *her username checked out*. His internet newsletter has been running for 17 years now, and apparently has 50 cases in the company’s favor since 2001, do the math and you find out that he can fuckin time travel. Now, there’s a lot of stock commentary websites, newsletters, tv shows and podcasts. Why has Citron Research become such a beacon to attract controversy?  

Why has Citron Research become such a beacon to attract controversy? Well, dear autists, the self proclaimed “*activist*” we’re talking about here, who sees himself as a messiah against corporate fraud and market manipulation is reported by NYTimes as follows : “He can make a killing in a bear market while everyone else on Wall Street suffers.” His methods of investment are rather questionable and has come under much of the financial world’s scrutiny.

Now, fellow autists, this part is very important. **This is his strategy**. Reported by NYTimes once again “After he places a bet against the price of a stock, he then publishes research designed to torpedo the company’s value, often by airing accusations of fraud or abuse. This is entirely legal, as long as what he publishes is not itself fraudulent. Left takes short positions in companies across a whole range of industries.” Keep in mind we are talking about a man that shorted Tesla stock in 2018 and got mad when it didn’t go his way. So mad that he sued Tesla and Papa Elon for stock manipulation. [Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/06/short-seller-andrew-left-files-class-action-lawsuit-against-tesla-and-elon-musk.html). 

SERIOUSLY, THIS DUDE FUCKING SHORTED TESLA AT **$177**, ITS AT **$4,325** TODAY (Pre-Split price). If this wasn’t enough wait to hear the companies in his “*ambitious track record*”. 

Since all of you lack basic correlation skills to connect the dots, let me do it for you fucking losers. What is he doing with GME. Are we not seeing the same pattern here? He is publicly short on GME and is tweeting it. He is known for this kind of manipulation. When he noticed the price had crossed the $43 wall he made it public that he is short GME. He could’ve scheduled the meeting immediately, but no. He scheduled it a day later, now this is perfect for the 🌈🐻 because, he is literally buying time. Buying time when alot of GME holders are in with their life savings on r/wsb. **24 HOURS IS ENOUGH TIME TO SOW THE SEEDS OF DOUBT AND CAUSE PARANOIA TO PEOPLE WITH THEIR LIFE ON LINE. BUT WHAT ARE WE GONA DO? WE ARE GOING TO FUCKING HOLD TO MARS**🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀. LATEST UPDATE received states that they chickened out of the livestream that was to be at 11:30AM EST. THEY NEED MORE TIME. THE SHORTS ARE SWEATING. THIS IS WORKING GUYS HOLD.


**SCANDAL #1**. Here’s a notable event on this aucstivist. In 2016, this 🌈🐻 was banned from the Hong Kong stock market for 5 years over a 2012 report on the firm China Evergrande Group as a result of releasing a report containing “false and/or misleading claims” about the above-mentioned company. Forced to pay a little over $720,000 as fines on the profits and legal expenses. He’s on his last string in HK, after his warning, he could end up in jail for violating once again. [Source](https://www.scmp.com/business/article/2038381/hong-kong-bans-short-seller-andrew-left-market-five-years).

**SCANDAL 2**. This guy is what he swore to destroy at this point wait till you read this. Jumia Technologies ($JMIA : NYSE) is an online e-commerce platform founded out of Nigeria in 2012. They gained a fair amount of traction and went public in Apr 2019. It was received very well and rose from around $25 at opening to $41 within a matter of a few weeks. Everything was well until Shitron Research adopted a short position and saw nothing of its potentials. The report came in accusing Jumia of fraud, torpedo’ing the company downwards. It dropped till approx. $2.80. BUT GUESS WHAT, SURPRISE! SHITRON AND ANDICKREW 🌈🐻 said they’re LONG ON THE STOCK. AND THERE’S **NO WAY** THEY’RE SHORTING AGAIN. This man capitalized on the drop of an e-commerce startup out of Nigeria and is now currently benefitting from the uprise. $JMIA sits at $45.56 as of now. [Source](https://www.theafricareport.com/45712/jumia-short-seller-andrew-left-changes-his-mind-now-buying-the-shares/)

Now these are just 2 scandals that I pointed out because no one on r/wsb seems to be aware of this. Now i’m pretty sure if you’ve been active on the sub you’ve seen the COLOSSAL failures this company has made. I’ll attach it right here. [JUST GO AND SEE THIS ITS IMPORTANT TO GET A PROPER VIEW](https://imgur.com/a/QvKVC9V).

Apart from this, another IMPORTANT info would be that, the live stream where he claimed he is going to expose the top 5 reasons why he’s GME short right now, would PROBABLY be live on his **TWITTER** (@CitronResearch). Hope to see everyone there and I CANNOT WAIT TO PROVE this self proclaimed ~~activist~~ WRONG.

NOW RETARDS KEEP READING BECAUSE, this is not possible without everyone holding tight and buying more 👐👐👐👐💎💎💎💎💎💎. We will be hit badly again, the boomer investors cannot take Citron’s cock out of their mouths, so we expect a sell off, DO NOT GIVE THE BEARS A CHANCE TO BUY. Today could even be a red day, **BUT FEAR NOT**. We will hopefully emerge victorious. I AM SO PROUD OF EVERY LAST AUTIST ON HERE 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀.

**NOTE** :

Holding our shares doesnt cost us anything 🤷🏻‍♂️.

The short sellers pay high borrow fees and will eventually get margin called if the price rises further.

A red day doesnt matter at all as we are not selling anyway 💎💎🙌🏼🙌🏼 its just a question of time until the next good news hit and it will explode 🔥🚀

213,GME,l7z0u9,2021-01-29 18:50:31,The GME shorts' endgame. INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.,"*READ*

Credit to [u/Pcbuildingnoob699](https://www.reddit.com/u/Pcbuildingnoob699/) \-- I'm rephrasing so it's just pure information/education and not financial advice.THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, THIS IS PURELY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES.

When might you want to sell? A quick guide for GME noobs.TL;DR: DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌

&#x200B;

Too much disinformation about when to sell. We are seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (WHICH IS ALMOST CERTAINLY NOT IN YOUR FINANCIAL INTEREST) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how some smart investors will play the ending. \[Note: I u/TheKageyOne, will not be selling at all, at least not for a long time. I'm in this to hurt the shorts, send a message, and watch GME grow and restructure into a totally new e-commerce and brick and mortar business in the coming years).

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

• ⁠Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. • ⁠Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. • ⁠A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

* imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days.
* Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) = 6 days

[https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME) = 6.3 days

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) = 5.78 days

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to **START** covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's **NOT** gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If people hold GME stocks play it right and hold while shorts cover, they can literally squeeze this to infinity as the shorts try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND DO WITH THIS INFORMATION WHAT YOU WILL. A LOT OF YOU ARE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

&#x200B;

Edit: Yes, I realize the days to cover reported in those links is actually lower now. I don't know enough to tell you what is accurate. I do know enough to tell you that if an investor buys and holds a share, there are fewer shares available for the shorts to cover with, so holding drives up the Days to Cover. If YOU are holding shares, YOU are controlling the Days to Cover. That is why so many people are advocating for 💎🙌",DD,0.98

218,SLV,l9jj7z,2021-01-31 20:15:40,Why an SLV squeeze will 100% not work.,"First of all, let's talk gamestop: it's a very simple centralized market. buy or sell shares of the company. So far so good.

The problem with SLV is that silver IS NOT A CENTRALIZED MARKET!

The biggest silver market is COMEX, which is a futures market. See, futures markets aren't the same thing as single stock markets, they are much bigger, have more institutions rather than retail investors and they are much more complicated.

When a typical retard buys gme, they hit buy market and that's it, they now have 1 share. 

In futures, it's different. You buy contracts, these contracts are standardized and the most popular contract for silver is : SI . SI has a contract size of 5000 troy ounces!! One contract is equal to  135000 $ worth of silver. You don't need to pay 135k for a contract, you can buy it for 14k if you close the position before you need to take delivery of the silver.

Some of you might have 14k, but the risk is very high: if silver moves down 1 dollar you lose 5k.

Another problem in the silver market are the participants: goverments own silver, hedge funds own silver, investment funds own silver, too many people own too much silver!! Gamestop is at about 30 billion dollars marketcap ( and that's now ). 

The open interest on the latest SI contract is 135 960, giving it an open interest value (which admitedly is not marketcap) of 18.354.600.000 usd. 18 billion usd in just open interest. 

Open interest is how many positions are open at any given time.

Silver is a much bigger market, with more big players.

GME - there weren't so many hedge funds (poor Melvin, that was the one big hedge fund shorting gme) and so it was a subreddit against a fund, and we won.

Silver is a different story - JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Citi, hedge funds, governments, a lot more money is in silver than gme.

For these reasons, don't go into SLV, you will just play where the big boys want you to play, they have the advantage there.

tl;dr : Silver won't moon, banks have advantage, hold gme to 10k.",DD,0.9

the war is not over! This is a war, which wasn't started by us. The fuckin hedgies started it and the list of their dirty, cheap illegal attacks is endless.

Just a reminder: today's price is still higher than exactly 1 week ago. I am still more than convinced that the squeeze is going to happen, but there is only one simple thing, which we have to do:

# HOLD

and/or

# BUY MORE

This is very important! The price drop does not reflect an actual drop in the value of the stock. We should not be tricked into selling.

Whatever happens, the hedgies know that they ARE FUCKED! So today's attack was probably one of the most desperate attacks in history and it will enter the history books as the biggest coordinated activity. But there is something bigger that is going to enter the history books and this is OUR STRENGTH AND OUR ROAD TO VICTORY!! They involved us in a war and now we have to win it.

APES! TOGETHER! STRONG!

231,APHA,lb255a,2021-02-02 19:06:14,"Aphria/Tilray Merger Arbitrage Opportunity, Plus APHA vs. CGC","Well my fellow degens, I have an interesting one for you. Aphria (**$APHA**) and Tilray (**$TLRY**) are merging to create the world’s biggest cannabis company. Close to 1B (874M to be exact) in annualized revenues which will only grow.

Anyways the merger states:

“Under the terms of the Arrangement, the shareholders of Aphria (the “Aphria Shareholders”) **will receive 0.8381 shares (the “Exchange Ratio”) of Tilray for each Aphria common share** (each, an “Aphria Share”), while holders of Tilray shares (the “Tilray Stockholders”) will continue to hold their Tilray shares (the “Tilray Shares”) with no adjustment to their holdings. Upon the completion of the Arrangement, Aphria Shareholders will own approximately 62 percent of the outstanding Tilray Shares.” [Source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201216005519/en/Aphria-and-Tilray-Combine-to-Create-Largest-Global-Cannabis-Company-With-Pro-Forma-Revenue-of-C874-Million-US685-Million)

This means Aphria should be trading at **.8381** of Tilray’s share price. Tilray is at $22.50 x .8381 = **$18.86**. Aphria should be trading at **$18.86**, yet it’s only at **$13.95.** That’s a whopping **34%** difference.

Considering Aphria is the stronger company and controls 62% of the combined company, it’s very rare for it to be trading so far away from the merger ratio. I’ve never seen a merger discrepancy like this before. If anything, Aphria should have the premium. Also, Tilray has high short interest so I doubt it will dip as shorts have to cover, it's most likely Aphria should catch up to Tilray's level.

**Aphria/Tilray vs. CGC**

Now let’s compare Aphria/Tilray to Canopy Growth. Canopy did 135M revenue last quarter which is approximately 540M annualized revenue along with a 96M net loss and a whopping adj. EBITDA loss of negative 85M. Furthermore, Canopy has -190M free cash flow, ([Source](https://www.canopygrowth.com/investors/news-releases/canopy-growth-reports-second-quarter-fiscal-2021-financial-results/))

Aphria did 160.5M revenue with Adj EBITDA of 12.6M. This will only increase as their next financials will have SweetWater Brewing on them. [Source](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/aphria-inc-announces-record-second-quarter-fiscal-year-2021-results-890905217.html)

Aphria expected to potentially be cash flow positive either this Q or next. “And we continue to work to be free cash flow positive in Q3, all subject to the intensity of COVID-19 restrictions in the markets where we operate. “

Canopy is valued at **15.8B USD**. Aphria/Tilray will be close to 1B annualized revenue, is EBITDA positive, and is valued at only 4.4 and 2.9B respectively. Not necessarily hating on CGC, the backing from Constellation is definitely solid, but when comparing the two Aphria should be valued higher.

Aphria leads Canada in market share ahead of CGC:  [Source](https://twitter.com/itsdgc/status/1356604397267124235)

Aphria also has a solid presence in the United States thanks to their EBITDA positive craft beer company, SweetWater who sells [cannabis-inspired beer](https://www.sweetwaterbrew.com/brews/420-strain-g13-ipa/).

Lastly, the U.S gov could act on some sort of cannabis legislature soon:

**TL;DR:** Aphria should be trading 34**% higher** than its current SP due to the .8381 merger ratio with Tilray.

If you are interested in cannabis, I believe there is much better value in Aphria/Tilray compared to CGC.

The bookie you use takes your bet and prices the horse 25/1... the horse wins the race by 75 lengths and you’re convinced it’s worth betting again.

The next race, the horse comes back and for some reason the bookie didn’t even bother to price the odds correctly and prices the horses odds at 20/1.
You take your winnings from last week and pile it all on your favourite horse to win again.

This cycle continues for a few weeks until you’ve taken your initial sum of money and cleared out the bookie for hundreds of thousands, millions perhaps.

This weeks race comes up and the bookie realised how much money you’ve made from this one horse and decides he doesn’t want to live with that kind of a loss to his balance sheet.

You place your bet with all of your winnings for this weeks race and again, the horses odds stay the same.

The bookie then makes a trip to the racecourse where your horse is, pauses the race and starts to smack your horse with a baseball bat to its legs for a while and then finally lets the race proceed. 

You lose your bet, all your winnings and the bookie is back to where he started because he couldn’t face having to lose all his money.

If this was a true story, the bookie and whoever helped him set this whole incident up would be sent to jail for defrauding the gambling industry and fixing the outcome of a race.

238,GME,lb7cww,2021-02-02 22:42:24,GME and AMC Apes 🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍,"Hey guys, first of all I know the morale is low today because of the big attack on GME from the hedge-fucks and their boyfriends. 

We need to hold strong, nobody said this battle will be easy or that it was going to be won in one week. 
The media put the spotlight on silver to diverge the attention we were getting. We were 2 million last week now we are 8 million. We have grown in numbers and I’m sure among us are some spies and trolls and just curios people. But I am certain that we will prevail. We need to hold the $100 line tomorrow and get it back to $200 by Friday, the hedgefucks and their boyfriends will have to do some buying in order to cover. 
It is mathematically impossible that they have covered from 130% short interest to just 30% that’s fucking impossible. 
1) Up until Friday the short interest had rather increased
2) I know for sure they didn’t fucking trade over the weekend 
3) Retail investors, we are holding a big chunk of those stocks 

Wake up ! They are trying to make us surrender, it is impossible that they have covered their positions between Friday and today. 

Let’s hold the line, let’s get it back to $200-$300 levels. 

We might have taken the short ladder down but we will take the elevator going up.

DO NOT LET THOSE BASTARDS WIN, WE MUST REMAIN STRONG AND UNITED. THE WHOLE WORLD IS WATCHING US. 

This is our legacy, we are being part of the history of investing and finance. We can be remembered as the ones who stood up against the big guy and won. 

We owe this to everyone who has lost before and has had their dreams crushed by the suits.

243,CLOV,lbe85k,2021-02-03 04:17:20,$CLOV,"I read Biden’s National Strategy for the covid-19 response and pandemic preparedness. There’s a ton of language in there about “strengthening essential data systems”. There is also an acknowledgment that such task may “require new technology”.

Some relevant language from strategy:

“Directs relevant federal agencies to collect, produce, share, analyze, and collaborate with respect to data supportive of COVID-19 response and recovery efforts.”

“Assist localities that struggle with public health infrastructure challenges that limit effective reporting or managing of COVID-19 data. The federal government will focus on states and localities that continue to struggle with antiquated data systems, especially jurisdictions that have trouble connecting testing laboratories and public health agencies to support case investigation, contact tracing, and support services for isolation of potentially exposed individuals. The federal government will work to surge personnel to assist with manual processes
in the near-term and develop data technologies to automate in the long-term.”

Where is all this new technology coming from? 🤷🏽‍♂️

In comes CLOV:

THE CLOVER ASSISTANT 

You have the exclusive opportunity to use Clover’s technology, the Clover Assistant. The Clover Assistant is designed by doctors for doctors to help enhance patient care and reduce administrative burden. We take advantage of Clover Health’s expansive data platform to deliver actionable and clear information, taking into consideration unique, patient-specific clinical data, needs, and circumstances. With a personalized design that focuses on proactive care, the Clover Assistant synthesizes and analyzes each patient’s information and makes real-time, personalized, dynamic, evidence-based recommendations right at the point of care.


ALSO read around and found that there have been a few bills introduced in congress over the past few months around data and privacy related to health. 

What do I think?

1. Biden = healthcare and he’s looking to score big there. This will be a focal point. You know ThE fIrSt 1o0 dAyS

2. The language in Elizabeth Warren’s bill is super specific about protections on how patient data is stored, anonymized, and shared. Okay... 

3. Pharmacy’s partner up with fed for covid vaccination and the day before clover issued a statement around getting covid vaccines. 


4. Now all of that sounds great. However, why the sudden rush to introduce bills that are clearly addressing a concern around patient’s health data? It raises all sorts if questions for me like:

Who’s collecting this data that you’re so worried about its use and privacy?

Where are these concerns coming from? What is it that we are protecting ourselves from? Is that not weird y’all? Anyway, I guess the point there is that there is clearly some big push to collect and use our patient data by the government (pretty scary imo). Plus you know, google backed Clover. Which leads me to believe, based on the language around new technology in Biden’s initiative, that they are going to have to acquire this technology from somewhere. Where from though? 


Anyway, I’m excited to see how this narrative plays out in the coming weeks and months. Healthcare is a heavy political space, especially under Biden. Based on recent news, something is brewing. Too many coincidences lining up.

You leave the Michelin 3-star restaurant that you decided to bring your wife and her boyfriend to. As you walk to your newly purchased custom made Tesla (codenamed Model G), in the corner of your eye you see your old workplace. You think to yourself *hmm.. brings back memories.* You take out your BlackBerry G1000 and tell SiriQ to drive your wife and her boyfriend home as you cross the street. You think to yourself *wow* *Siri has gotten 10 times better after BB bought over AAPL and merged Siri with QNX.*

As you enter your previous 9-5 abode, you smirk as you say to yourself *Sir, this is a Wendy’s.* That joke just never gets old. Upon entering you immediately recognize the server. You used to hate him but that hatred has now turned to pity. *Ah I’ll throw him a bone* you think to yourself as you give Andrew the secret hand signal to meet you at the back for the Wendy’s Special.

You go out back to your usual spot but notice there’s a homeless man there sleeping in the dumpster. Andrew then says *It’s $12,200 for a handie*. Exactly the price of one GME share. Oh god… has he really not covered his short position yet?! You take out your wallet to pay Andrew his fee but he catches you off-guard and snatches it away from you. He throws your wallet to the man in the dumpster and they both made a run for it. In the darkness you vaguely make up the back of the man’s shirt which read “Melvin Capital”.

You shake your head as you take out your phone and tell SiriQ to send aid. Two beams of light descend from the sky and blast Andrew & Melvin. *Impressive* you think to yourself as you witness first hand the power of GothamX, a collaboration between Palantir and SpaceX. GothamX blasted a non-lethal laser developed by Tesla from a SpaceX satellite using the pinpoint accurate latitude and longitudes provided by Palantir. *What a technological marvel* you think to yourself. This was the only DD that you needed.

*What perfect timing* you think to yourself as your self driving Tesla Model G comes back after sending your wife and her boyfriend home. You submit your limit order for 10,000x contracts of Palantir & Tesla FD’s, get in your Tesla and head home. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.

I just wanted to say how blown away I am by what's happening. Last year, I was heavily invested (most of my portfolio, not smart I know) in GNUS which ended up getting fucked by and over-shorted by Citron resulting in heavy losses. I was doing very well trading until that point which probably gave me the confidence to commit that much capital. I was forced to pull back from trading because I couldn't sustain the loss. I'm 22 with a tax bill and a business that's on hold due to covid so I can only take so many losses. Another year, another opportunity for a bounce-back hopefully.  I genuinely believed in the company and went long but then Citron came along and created a shitstorm of bad PR and almost got the company delisted essentially with how far they forced the price down. I remember seeing teachers, firemen, and just regular people who put their life savings get burned badly by these institutions for absolutely no reason.

They tried to do the same with GameStop but you guys didn't let it happen. This genuinely makes me so fucking proud and brings tears to my eyes.

I'm playing a part in this movement by trying to educate as many people around as possible on the situation, explaining what's going on, where to buy GME and why these institutions deserve the punishment they're getting. It's working!!! Excited to be back in the game once I hopefully get the business up and running after covid.

TL;DR Blackberry/AWS IVY will be in every single vehicle produced after 2022. EV or ICE, self-driving or boomer driving, it doesn't fucking matter. It 🚀 will 🚀 be 🚀 in 🚀 every 🚀 single 🚀 one 🚀 Oh, and Blackberry QNX Neutrinos RTOS is fun too.

Before you start reading, I'd suggest grabbing a snack and a drink. Cause I'm about to drop a fucking novel.

You've probably heard Blackberry QNX a few times around other DDs but you're wondering wtf is it and who the hell is even using it. QNX is an Real Time Operating System (more on this later) meant for vehicles, and it's been around for a really long time. Currently there are at least 175m cars running around with QNX. As for what cars those are, I'll keep it short: Apple Car Play was developed on QNX.

So why haven't we heard more about Blackberry in recent years since there's so many QNX cars around? 2 reasons. 1: Dumbasses like you thought it was a phone company. 2: QNX is so ahead of the fucking game that boomer auto manufacturers like Ford and Mercedes were too stupid to use it effectively. For the last few years it's just been used to turn on your car's radio. *But things have changed now.*

**Zombie cars and QNX**

QNX is the first commercial microkernel RTOS. *What the fuck does that even mean nerd?* For anyone like me who's not a software genius, I've done some research so we all know what we're getting into. A Real Time Operating System is developed to focus processing power on two most important things: Speed and Accuracy. This is different from shit like Windows and Mac OS (General Purpose OS or GPOS) as they spread processing power throughout the system because there isn't exactly anything that's significantly more important than the others. However, when you're using a self-driving program you need the hardware to perform the action at the exact time and speed. Your self driving program brakes too late? Crash into the car ahead of you. Your self program turns the wheel too late or too soon? Crash into a wall.

Blackberry has been working on this technology since 2014. But car makers literally couldn't develop autonomous vehicles fast enough. So these guys have just been twiddling their fucking thumbs.

Fast forward to now, where the rise of Tesla has made everyone and their momma make a self driving EV. Everyone is trying to make their own autopilot *program* but not their own OS. So who's OS are they using?

[SONY?](https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/sony-reveals-more-details-on-its-secretive-vision-s-sedan/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGWdfOT_GLnUXiZBQr4m4lDr6V0nzG6pkRMU6WLRNhsLRKDJHY4MAwxHb-HWZr3pDmEfBYyleSgqSAIjoeXMqU6MfKVSgBbWY5t8brOzZ61dAfzBMOQezOwKfHLLecBdHNEqSjqSskM_c-uUKa-IndxUGWi_Ay9pQMD4kj0iDqvI) Blackberry QNX.

If you read the article, you'll see XPEV is using DESAY's autopilot program that's built on QNX. Know who else is using DESAY autopilot? [Li Auto](https://en.desaysv.com/index.php?id=4974) But what about Nio you might ask? Well on NIO day, it was announced that NIO will be using [Nvidia](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/nvidia-announces-world-first-functionally-safe-ai-self-driving-platform) DRIVE....which is also built on QNX. What about the Apple car? There's no confirmation yet, but rumors of them reaching out to both [Canoo](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/blackberry-to-power-autonomy-systems-in-canoos-next-generation-electric-vehicles) and [Hyundai](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2019/hyundai-autron-selects-blackberry-qnx-to-power-next-generation-adas-and-autonomous-driving-software-platform) makes me skeptical that Apple has succeeded in creating their own RTOS even after rumors of them starting 7 years ago. *But even if they did... it doesn't even matter.*

You might have noticed that I didn't mention Tesla at all. That's because they have developed their own Linux-based Operating system, which Tesla has been having trouble getting it approved by US safety regulations. QNX on the other hand, already is. $BB to the fucking moon🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Linux is also an open source OS and this becomes a huge problem when we talk about zombie cars.

That's right. *Motherfucking zombie cars*. You know that scene in ""Fate of the Furious"" where Charlize Theron straight up just hacks all the cars in the city and starts slamming them into buildings? Yea, this is a legitimate fear of the U.S. government and Linux is not going to pass any safety regulations. And you better believe after SolarWind and FireEye hacks, Cybersecurity is the hottest topic right now when it comes to national security. You better believe the U.S. Government won't just allow open source OS flowing around millions of autonomous driving cars that can be hijacked at any time of day.

You know who does have MULTIPLE government certifications already though? Blackberry bb. I won't get it, but you can read [u/josh\_moworld](https://www.reddit.com/u/josh_moworld/)'s post right [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxknrl/bb_dd_9_reasons_why_bb_is_from_former_bb_employee/) to get a better idea Blackberry's history with the U.S. government and security.

The best part about it all is, Blackberry designed QNX to be 100% POSIX compliant. In dumbass terms it basically means any LINUX based program can be ported over easily. Come join the dark side, Elon.

Now that you're pretty much caught up to speed on QNX, let's move over to IVY and why I believe IVY will be Blackberry's return to the throne 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

**Blackberry x AWS IVY**

IVY is a co-development between Blackberry and Amazon and it is a 50/50 partnership. That's right; Jeff Bezos, the second richest man in the world and king of predatory business practices chose to partner with a company that has a $5.5b market cap. All hail, John Chen 👑👑👑

So what is IVY? Basically IVY cloud-based software that OEMs can install into their QNX vehicles (or any OS) and read sensor data from the vehicle's DCUs (domain controller units). These are basically sensors that give you data such as: times that you unlocked and locked your car, your car's wheel speed sensors, wiper arm sensors, tire pressure etc. In a Tesla, which is loaded with sensors, you will also see: sentry mode data, when an small object hits your car while parked, how hard you step on the accelerator, how hard you brake etc.

IVY basically captures this data and in real time sends it to OEMs for them to analyze. Cars are going to be fitted with more and more sensors (regardless of if they have autonomous systems or not) and the data that IVY provides is very helpful. This allows OEMs to see their customer's car preferences or driving styles and can further develop their future vehicles to match customer's interests. Also, since the data is transferred in REAL TIME, things like horrible weather conditions, traffic updates, and icy roads can be communicated to all vehicles within the OEM network so that people can be notified ahead of time.

But you know which industry would *love* this? Insurance companies. OEMs can gather all the safety data that IVY delivers and actually PROVE to insurance companies that their cars are safer. You know how Tesla had to come up with their own auto insurance? That was because Insurance companies were charging crazy high rates for Tesla's that had auto pilot. They didn't know exactly how to rate the risk, or who would take the blame. With Blackberry IVY, OEMs and insurance companies can partner together and have reliable data to work off of.

Best part of it all, IVY is extremely scalable and is a subscription based service. There isn't an exact price announced yet, but you know if Jeff Bezos is involved then there will definitely be a lot of profits flowing in from IVY.

For me, I'm long-term on $BB with some options to take advantage of the recent hype. I plan on holding shares until I see an actual competitor to QNX and IVY... which I've looked all over the internet and I can't find any. And honestly, Blackberry's security suite has so much to offer this isn't even the complete DD. I've just been typing for too long and figured it was a good time to stop. Maybe I will write another post in the future.",DD,0.98

amounts of short covering and paper hands selling on each bump (we'll know more
when Ortex posts data in the morning).


Yes it took a bit of a dip in the after market, but I expect greatness from our German
brothers and sisters to keep the momentum up today. The plan is the same: buy and hold. 

# *It is working*.

What's most interesting rn is the new $ amount of calls about to expire.


I had to compile a spreadsheet for this from multiple sources because my usual
source didn't have the complete data (highly sus? Are they trying to hide this
data?)

Spreadsheet:

https://imgur.com/a/zXTeR4t

This is essentially just the options chain you can look up. But, if you take
the Open Interest (how many contracts are alive), multiply that by the latest
close price * 100 and then sum all the contracts you get the total amount of $ of shares that are about to be
exercised. 

What's crazy about GME right now?

# EVERY CLIT LICKING CALL IS ITM

That is *insane*. Never seen it before.


Tuesday ended with all those options worth $800mill 


Wednesday? They jumped to $3.5 *billion* and it will continue to rise as share prices rises. Buy and hold.


Two things are gonna happen b/c of this:


-1. Mega Gamma Squeeze. MM's who weren't properly hedged before are about to be (they will have to buy shares on the market
in order to cover these calls expiring higher than their delta position). But remember, all you degens are buying and holding, so there's low af volume and prices skyrocket with every share we *force* them to buy. Read this:
https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/26/gamestops-gargantuan-gamma-squeeze/


tl;dr


> If the stock continues to rise, the market maker's delta position also
> becomes increasingly negative at a faster rate due to gamma, requiring more
> buying, which pushes the stock even higher still, and so forth. This
> phenomenon is known as a gamma squeeze and the feedback loop resembles a
> regular short squeeze.

*feedback loop* you say? 

# Sounds like tendie rocket to me if everyone holds.

-2. Many of these shares can be exercised into proper diamond hands instead of in MM's accounts that will 
loan them back out to shorts. Further squozing the squeezees. This, however requires the owner to put up another position to
exercise.


Moral of the story:


If GME holds or even goes up further Thur & Fri this gamma squeeze could very
likely be the catalyst for the big squeeze come next week.


And it will be *epic*.

277,ARE,l8uu76,2021-01-30 21:25:46,The $GME squeeze will bring down Melvin. The Silver squeeze will bring down the biggest banks in the world. That's why Robinhood barred trading of $SLV the day after they took a billion dollars in loans from JPM and Goldman Sachs. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME.,"You retarted apes are growing up. I remember a year ago this sub was nothing but memes of J-Powell littered with rocketship emojis. Now It's GME posts littered rocketship emojis. We've come so far. 

Now listen:

If you think Wall Street is shitting their pants over the GME short squeeze you are 100% right. Jim Bianco lays out a [convincing case](https://www.financialsense.com/podcast/19847/jim-bianco-gamestop-and-great-short-seller-takedown#.YBTK3GAFZmU.twitter) that SPY was down 2% on Friday because hedge funds were dropping their ""safe"" stocks to raise capital for collateral against their rising margin debt on GME. 

But you also got to know this. At the same moment Robinhood halted purchases of GME, after calls from their hedge fund buddies, they also put on limits on $SLV. 

([Here is the list of all limited stocks](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-due-to-recent-market-volatility/) \- they've since added weird stuff like Starbucks, but $SLV was one of the first along with $GME and $AMC). I think that's pretty weird, considering that, unlike these other stocks, $SLV was up only a few percent on Thursday. It's even weirder when you consider that Robinhood had just been [bailed out by JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/robinhood-is-said-to-draw-on-credit-lines-from-banks-amid-tumult?sref=rY0z5sRB)! These fuckers are two of the worst silver manipulators out there. (Seriously. Link for [Goldman](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bank-nova-divestiture-goldman-sachs-idUSKBN1DS2C5). Link for [JPM](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/29/jp-morgan-settles-spoofing-lawsuit-alleging-fraud-in-metals-trades.html))

These banks have been raking it in on suppressing the price of silver for  decades. Look at this historical chart of silver. Does this make any sense? Silver was well over $30 for several years in the ***fucking 1980s.*** And now it's $27???

&#x200B;

The fair price of silver, conservatively is CERTAINLY over $50, but it seems that there were some strings attached to JPM and GS's little loan to Robinhood. 

I'm balls deep in GME, but am riding this silver train too. Already last week $AG and $SLV were surging despite Robinhood's best efforts. If this thing breaks, both of those tickers will at least double. My personal price target for Silver is $70. The tendies from silver will be extra sweet for me  - nothing like breaking up the greatest cartel in modern history (apologies to OPEC). 

Keep fighting the good fight apes. We'll bring these bastards to their knees. 

My positions: $GME shares, $AG and $SLV shares and July calls.

SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*.

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.

DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY.

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the **false expectation** of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. **DON'T BE THAT PERSON.**

Without getting too technical, a group of fucking assholes called Melvin Capital or some shit are knee deep in Puts. They were suppressing the price at 22$ for the past month. Today the price shot up 60% and Melvin is probably having a stroke right now. They will have to eventually buy these shares back from us Autists, institutions, and every other lucky fuck who has a GME share to sell. 

Problem for these boomers, is that the board of $GME holds 20% of the overall stock. On top of that, institutions like Blackrock, Vanguard hold another 20% or so, they will NOT sell. Wall Street Bets has 1.8 million users. Dont underestimate our power. On top of that, Cramer is going to shill this to every boomer today/tommorow. Look at his twitter.

So basically Autists, if we keep buying up GME, Melvin and his boomer friends will be fukt. GME at a $25 Billion market cap means that GME is valued at ~300$/share. 35$ is a STEAL.

Mudrick Capital Management earned 9.8% in January, one of
its best months ever, making the bulk of its gains on debt and equity options of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., said the person, who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public. The firm also profited from the volatility in shares of GameStop Corp.
The $3.1 billion hedge fund booked most of the gains on its debt holdings in AMC and about $50 million selling out-of-the-money call options on the stock last week, the person said. The shares surged more than 500% in January before retreating sharply Tuesday. Mudrick also profited by selling out-of-the-money call options on GameStop, the person said. A spokesman for New York-based Mudrick declined to comment.
AMC’s Sudden Surge Makes Winners of Silver Lake, Mudrick Capital had provided $100 million of new financing to AMC in December to help keep the beleaguered movie-theater chain afloat.

When there’s a great supply (selling) and low demand (people not interested in purchasing) the price of the stock goes down. 

When there’s high demand (people interested in buying) and low supply (low selling) the price of the stock goes up because people are willing to pay higher prices making the stock goes up 

The ILLEGAL MANIPULATION Wall Street is doing is that there’s HIGH DEMAND around the world to PURCHASE stock BUT by RESTRICTING how much you purchase WALLSTREET is illegally creating a LOW DEMAND of the stock MAKING IT GO DOWN IN PRICE!

if there were no restrictions you can see ppl around the world want to get in and buy. Therefore these BIG DIPS  MAKE NO SENSE unless there’s MANIPULATION. 

If walstreet wasn’t manipulating the stock, with the high demand there is. AMC AND GME WOULDVE 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕 by now.

 *""Bulls make money, bears make money,* ***pigs get slaughtered****""* 

How ironic, that one of the most iconic sayings in investing, was coined by Wall Street itself. Right now, pigs are getting slaughtered, and crying for someone to blame.

**I want you guys to really think about this:**

Every investment you make, comes with inherit risks and rewards. These hedge funds, who shorted 130%+ of the GME float, took a MASSIVE FUCKING RISK. They beat this stock down to a pulp, and instead of taking out their profits (like bears), they got greedy (like fucking pigs) and continued to increase their short.

They are literally affecting peoples lives. Those who work at Gamestop. They wanted this to go completely bankrupt. Oh, and who's going to bail out the average joe? Who bails out Jim, who works behind the counter at Gamestop?

NO ONE.

But who bails out these hedge funds? Fucking think about it. Melvin Capital gets a 3bn bailout, because they took a HUGE FUCKING RISK, and got caught on the losing end. 

Also, lets talk about risk for a second.

These hedge fund and institutions took a big risk that didnt pan out. Okay, not a big deal. they can just take the L and move on. But no. They doubled down, and you get articles now BLAMING THE RETAIL INVESTOR FOR MANIPULATION. 

So let me ask you this:

1. they took a huge risk on a bet
2. they are losing the bet
3. instead of being on the receiving end of the loss, they blame others for the situation that they're in

If you take a huge risk, and you KNOW that there is a chance of a loss, and that loss occurs, the only reason why you would start blaming others and finding excuses, is because there is an inherit FLAW in the system.

Melvin and other shorts knew, that there was no way something like this could happen. Why? Because they have the instruments to manipulate you and your emotions, through BS articles, analysts, and mass media.

TLDR:

1. Shorts shorted 130%, took a huge risk and lost
2. instead of taking the L, they're blaming YOU for manipulating the market",Discussion,0.99

Now, let’s look at the technicals. It currently has a 52% short float, which lags large squeezes like GME (121%) and SPCE (72%), but exceeds that of other performing names like AMC and BB.

I think $SKT is so compelling at a roughly $1.2B market cap. For comparison, its primary competitor $MAC has double the valuation, but does not have the same flexible retail space as Tanger.

If you look at GME’s short squeeze, they shot up right around $20 or ($1.2B market cap)!! 👀 Furthermore, Melvin and other big hedge funds are long on their $SKT shorts, and any surprise to the upside will send the stock absolutely flying.

Tanger has also reinstated their dividend. In a time where many bricks and mortar retail shops are desparate for cash, $SKT is out here with $700M of liquidity.

Companies with this much cash relative to their market cap are INTRINSICALLY UNDERVALUED. Even if this thing were to just double in market cap to just under $3B, that would leave a share price of roughly $32. The intrinsic value of the mall network is worth AT LEAST (in my mind) 5-7X where we are now at roughly $13 ($1.2B). 

These other names that I mentioned above have taken off given their market cap of $3-5B, and I FULLY EXPECT THAT RALLY TO CONTINUE. The short interest here is just too overwhelming for it to not push the stock flying at the slightest uptick.

But for the best value play, FACTORED WITH THE HEAVY SHORT FLOAT, I gotta go with $SKT. Holding 3200 shares at $17 and adding more as we go down. 18.7 days left for shorters to cover, so I think the squeeze is coming soon.

** Check out Tanger’s new CEO, Steven Yalof, if you are interested. He was a prominent leader at Simon Property Group, with the intent on expanding consumer base beyond retail stores. Let’s hope he get’s it right with $SKT. 🙏🏾

1. **GOLDEN Cross  2. Highly Shorted  3. Positive PR 4. Expanding Market 5. Under $10 stock 6. Actively traded by young traders**

&#x200B;

Some of you may have read (or seen because you cannot read) my post yesterday about a Gamma squeeze today. ([1/29/21 - The Great Battle For Valhalla](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7b6t7/12921_the_battle_for_valhalla_gammainfinity/)) While I believe a Gamma squeeze in fact occurred, it was curtailed and did not catalyze the MOASS (Mother of All Short Squeezes) because brokerages like ROBINHOOD intentionally limited our ability to buy shares/apply pressure to the shorts 🩳AKA 👿Melvin Capital AKA 👿Citadel LLC.

&#x200B;

To be clear:

&#x200B;

[Melvin Capital 👿](https://preview.redd.it/f3wgl6mswde61.jpg?width=326&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9aa66ee90c72d260693450cd2be6d5bcb022960b)

[Us 👨‍🚀👨‍🚀👨‍🚀 --\> What is your profession? DIAMOND HANDING LIKE A WSB RETARD! 🤚🏻💎](https://preview.redd.it/s0kflystwde61.jpg?width=385&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f6863f1f9cba33c8264afd44e912a78ed3e59d06)

&#x200B;

**BUT WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN LIEUTENANT** u/Brassmonkeynutzz?

&#x200B;

Ok. Let's start with the basics for all of you who are wet behind the ears. What is a Gamma squeeze you ask? A Gamma squeeze occurs when option sellers/market makers buy shares of the underlying stock to hedge their positions/prepare for the possibility that call option buyers decide to exercise their right to buy. This type of hedge is necessary when a significant amount of call option strikes are expiring in the money (last week all available strikes expired in the money on a stock for the first time in financial history and this week a shit load of strikes expired in the money as well).

&#x200B;

Wait, you aren't actually reading this are you? If you are, I appreciate you. For those of you who cannot read (all of you), please see the TL;CR at the bottom of this post. (Hint: 🚀)

&#x200B;

Anyways, you might be wondering, why would Robinhood risk its reputation and entire business by limiting its customers ability to buy? Simple: ""Robinhood’s regulatory filings show the company charges large investment firms called “market makers” (👿CITADEL/MELVIN) fees to access real-time information about which stocks its users are buying and selling, a practice some regulators and industry watchers have seen as a potential conflict of interest."" In fact, ""Robinhood routes more than half of its customer orders to Citadel, by far its largest market-making partner by volume, Robinhood disclosures show."" ([source](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/robinhood-and-citadels-relationship-comes-into-focus-as-washington-vows-to-examine-stock-market-moves/ar-BB1ddG06))

&#x200B;

In other words, Robinhood is more concerned about saving the GAY BEARS 🌈🐻 that they are in bed with (their real customers - 👿CITADEL/MELVIN) than servicing retail investors like us. Ironically, Robinhood is taking from the poor and giving to the rich—it is ass backwards.

&#x200B;

Before I go any further, I have to once again congratulate all of the true autists who have diamond handed 🙌🏻💎thus far. Thank you for holding. You are truly retarded and I salute you. And of course, I salute our King, u/DeepFuckingValue🤴, with the utmost respect. We fought valiantly in ""The Great Battle for Valhalla"" today. And it is very promising that EVEN DESPITE Robinhood limiting our retarded power, we went from closing at 196 yesterday to 328 at close today, and 312 as I write this post. But clearly, this infinity war is far from over.

&#x200B;

If you sold like a paper handed pussy 📄🤚🏻🙀, then you are not a true WSB autist soldier. You are not one of us. Go invest in an ETF and leave this sub forever!

&#x200B;

**But I am a true autist, what can I do?**

&#x200B;

First things first, GTFO of Robinhood immediately if you do not have options expiring within the next week and transfer your portfolio to literally any other brokerage.  **(EDIT: Transferring will lock up your shares/portfolio until the transfer is complete, which could take a week or so; so only transfer now if you are ok with that—I am just so disgusted with RH at this point that I almost don't care and will be diamond handing my shares for more than a week most likely anyways).**  They are fucking criminals and they are trying to delay/mitigate the MOASS. I am personally transferring to **(EDIT) FIDELITY** unless you tards have a better suggestion.

&#x200B;

For those of you who were clenching when we got down to around 126 yesterday and around 250 today. I know you were scared. But the following cannot be overstated: **THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT! FEAR!!!!!**

&#x200B;

**JUST FUCKING HOLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!** THEY WANT YOUR FUCKING SHARES SO BAD BECAUSE THERE IS A HUGE SHORTAGE.

&#x200B;

**HOLD THE MOTHERFUCKING LINE AND WE RIDE TO VALHALLA!**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Shortage? YES A FUCKING SHORTAGE. Over 100% shares are still shorted. Do not listen to anyone who says Melvin Capital has closed out their short position. That is total bullshit.

&#x200B;

But, but, but, WhY iS CNBC AdVeRtIsInG tHaT MeLvIn ClOsEd iTs sHoRt pOsItiOn tHeN 🤪? ([Great post talking about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8539h/cnbc_now_running_ads_promoting_that_melvin/)) I mean seriously, ask yourselves, why the fuck would CNBC run paid advertisements about the shorts closing their positions? BECAUSE THE BIG BOYS WANT YOU TO THINK THE SQUEEZE IS OVER SO YOU SELL AND GIVE UP. FEAR NOT; THE SQUEEZE HAS NOT SQUOZEN!

&#x200B;

**Think about it:** if Melvin closed its short position, it would simply move on to the next trade and never look back. There would not be any reason to ***pay*** to advertise that.

&#x200B;

**Summary:** the big dogs want you to think the squeeze is over, and they want you to panic and sell your shares. DO...NOT...DO...IT! Instead, **HOLD! BUY THE DIP! REPEAT!**

&#x200B;

**Monday, we ride at dawn!**

THIS ADVICE IS FOR NEW BUYERS ONLY OR FOR THOSE WHO HOLD MORE THAN 5 SHARES IN RH AND WANT TO BUY MORE. ANYONE BOUGHT ON RH, DISABLE STOP LIMIT. DISABLE MARGIN, AND HOLD ON CASH.**

Lets get this shit out of the way right now. The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.

So here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...

🚀🚀Fidelity and Vanguard🚀🚀. You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.

This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this.

**TLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. They will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.**

Take this opportunity by the balls and never let go. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

List all culprits here.,"Go look at posts/comments from earlier today from dudes wondering where the hell to buy GME because their non-RH broker of choice ALSO banned purchasing GME. GME dropped over 75% from its high not because just RH did this, and we all know it.

MOST BROKERS DID THIS. MOST OF THEM.

Now - go look at the front page of Reddit, the front page of your favorite news source, and the tweets of your favorite politicians. 95% of mentions of these shenanigans mention ONLY RH.

Why's that? Hell, you KNOW why deep down, but let's spell it out.

These prominent people - politicians, celebs, rich people, etc. - who are suddenly on your side would **love** to see **only RH** bite the dust. RH already had been disrupting the industry and taking business away from the established brokers who were charging ridiculous fees from back when you had to hop on the phone and call a broker to perform trades.

The second RH goes away, and other newer ones like WeBull get similarly targeted and scrutinized, what'll happen? Return of the $8+ per trade $1 per contract BS as the norm. Fees that go down with the more money spent, because brokers loooove rich people, and hate us and want to rake as much as they can from us.

Should RH get reamed? Absolutely. Should all the other brokers that pulled these shenanigans get reamed too? You betcha. And right now, that's clearly not going to happen. I've not seen a single politician, including AOC, mention ANY broker other than RH. Hell, a congressperson drafted a fucking letter about troubling/concerning yada yada about RobinHood. Only RobinHood. **Again, MOST BROKERS did this.**

Frankly, ANY broker that pulled this shit should be shut the fuck down. If not by the law, by their customers getting the fuck away from their thieving asses.

So, did your broker do this to you too? List 'em here. Hell, make a separate post about them. Upvote all of them. Let's not let them get away with this. They're trying to sneak out of a war they started and present RH as the lone culprit and make you feel warm and happy about class action lawsuits that'll get you a baconator in about 5 years. Don't let them.

It's clear the media and politicians all intend for those other brokers to get away with it. The ONLY way they won't is for us to plaster their names everywhere and make it IMPOSSIBLE to ignore.",Discussion,0.99

**4:00 AM**

Light skirmishes started early with retards from the 136th Armored Idiots surprising the enemy and taking substantial ground out of the gate. Caught off guard, the enemy was driven back on their heels. The boost in morale was immediate and would reverberate through the rest of the bloody day.

**5:00 AM**

The enemy awoke to chaos and confusion, but managed a minor rally, driving the 136th back into the arms of the 103rd Sleepy Retards. They would go on to put up a valiant fight and suffer many casualties in the coming hours. The fighting was sporadic but intense at times.

**6:00 AM - 9:30 AM**

Skirmishes continued between the lines of the 90th Diamond Dildos and 103rd. Battle lines were drawn and troop positions massed in these key early hours. The skirmishing saw gains come and go and would telegraph the bloody day to come.

**9:30 AM - 11:30 AM**

In an explosive maneuver, general [u/deepfuckingvalue](https://www.reddit.com/u/deepfuckingvalue/) assembled and unleased the full might of the 159th Weaponized Autists. The fighting was sustained, intense, and bloody. The 159th gained ground at an alarming rate and it appeared as if total capitulation of the enemy was imminent. Troops that managed to penetrate deep into enemy territory reported seeing the enemy General Left stuff mouthfuls of crayons into his face and shit waxy rainbows.

**11:30 AM - 1:00 PM**

We underestimated the resolve of the enemy. A flanking move by General Melvin took the 159th in the rear and scattered our troops. The fear caused a substantial complement of our soldiers to desert and run for the hills on the spot. I have not words for these cowards. At the same time, I saw good men - nay, great men - of the 159th, 150th, 140th, 130th, 120th, 110th, 100th, 90th, and 80th cut down en-masse. I will not speak further of this here other than to say that they will be avenged and see their names carved into the stones of Valhalla itself.

**1:00 PM - 4:00 PM**

I can only note here the deep pride I feel in my men and in my cause. I am not an emotional man, but what I saw with mine own eyes today would evoke emotion in the stoniest of hearts. After what appeared to be a stunning reversal and brief loss of ground, my men dug in their heels and fought like legends out of my childhood stories. Ground was given and taken over the next few hours, but at the end of the day, the enemy was driven back. My heart is filled with pride and hope for the future.

This day will not be forgotten.

**Summary**
TLDR version: Cloud/email/data security. Huge growth, recent acquisition, fair value estimate showing ~50% upside, earnings in 2 weeks at which point the fair value will likely increase even further as the recurring revenues from acquisitions and the continued growth push the data averages higher.

Call volume for March-May expirys have been spiking, so that's where I'm at. Since the fair value is over $12, I'm buying $11 and $12 strikes.

By concentrating enough WSB autism in one point in the form of $60 call options, you created a previously unproven distortion of the fabric of vol/price/time known as a Degenerity, where vol became price, green became red (for dealers) red became green (for option holders), bears like me get excited for bulls, and the market broke, spawning a wormhole to a new universe where GME is somehow above it's ATH, and spraying out a massive field distortion via degenerons, which are now being detected on CNBC.  It's like a black hole, but with options. I look forward to those with PhDs in physics and finance expanding upon this theory. Expect additional unforseen repercussions such as*** r/investing ***advocating a 10% allocation to ""YOLO"" in their now 4 fund portfolio (domestic stocks, global stocks, bonds, YOLO).***

**TLDR: I think Market Makers got completely screwed today by this sub's unprecedented call buying yesterday. Expect some people to get fired. They normally can hedge their calls they sold you buying stock as price moves, but there wasn't supply for them to buy the 15m shares they needed in the 3 hour period this AM, and realy, a good 8-10m of that need happened in a few minute period which was when the market broke. I suspect MM's are going to be in the hole $100-200 million today. And yeah, some people are getting fired. You guys did it - you made the Degenerity! GME hit an all time high price (but not all time high market cap)**

&#x200B;

**Not a short squeeze:**

I don't think this is a short squeeze primarily. I think we are actually seeing a gamma squeeze in which dealers could not hedge as quickly as their short calls lost value, and citadel and other market makers are losing hundreds of millions today as a group, which almost never happens, especially at this scale.

Shorts don't HAVE to cover until there are 0 shares to borrow and they get bought in. They may get margin called before, but institutions diversify. And there are shares to borrow to an extent, rate still 22% on IB. I'm sure some of this happened, but you can't really force this until the many hundreds on a typical hedge fund book.

On the other hand, looking at options, OI went up a lot overnight - I sadly did not check this AM. You now have 80K calls expiring today at 55 to 60 bucks, then another 70k next week, and another maybe 50k at longer dates. That is what we call...  🚀 ⛽

That's 200k, or 20m shares!!! To hedge that at 63+ you need... about 20m shares.  Of course, some are thetagang short options, so call it 15m shares. Keep in mind, dealers had 25-30m shares before this going into today, so they now want to hold 40-45m shares (on 110m sythethic float of loaned shares + real shares) 🚀 ⛽ 🚀 ⛽ 🚀 ⛽

When the ramp started around 55, dealers had to rush to buy shares, but could not get 15m shares between $50 and $60.  When it hit $60, there was a HUGE amount of options all at once, and market liquidity was insufficient (""The Degenerity""). At the writing of this post in the morning during the halt, it means they are losing $10m per dollar move in the price, and will pay any price to stop the bleeding. I'm sure some guys in their risk mgmt department are getting fired over this, as the writing was on the wall, and they still sold you guys calls - they should've been charging $10 a call yesterday to protect themselves, or offering much higher strikes to tempt money into that and away from over-concentrating at $60. I suspect when the dust settles, we will find out that the better market makers BOUGHT calls from other market makers, and would not be surprised if there's an 8-k from a market maker tonight about exceptional losses. You may actually bankrupt a small one. Because the mass of calls at $60 got so heavy, it became impossible to hedge in real time.

In terms of gamma conditions from here, there's no remaining real ramp once you are at around 63.

**Edit #3: Previously said we would see stagnation right under $60 because dealers have an interest in a $60 close and probably own 40m+ shares at this point offsetting the huge short calls - and had to unload 6m shares in ITM calls ending today. But it looks like they either don't care or are losing control with this hot close at $64.75. Going to be a lot of share delivery into Monday, maybe as much as 10m.  That'll be interesting to sort out.**

**I'm a bear, but seriously, congrats bulls, you did break the market, but maybe not in the way you think you did. I really think the guys you screwed today were MMs, probably on the order of $100-200m... I have profound respect for what you did. Yes, my puts sucked, I'm down $35k all together on trying to play this one. You are welcome, you deserve it.**  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

And I'm really dumb for not checking open interest this morning. Writing was on the wall due to all the calls you guys bought yesterday. It's infuriating when you know you could've seen it in plain sight and were too busy doing something else to check.

I do think MMs will be more careful on this moving forward and make this less likely to repeat. This epic failure on their part is going to attract CIO level oversight. Unlike the meltup last Wednesday where they got to hedge smoothly, they were not able to hedge here.

Also, wanted to link you guys Martin Shkreli's comments on the GME situation from YESTERDAY via people who have access to him I guess by phone (since he still has about a year of federal prison left)? Very interesting. Looking forward to his read as someone who's squeezed someone before:

423,GME,lbi6em,2021-02-03 08:18:44,Do the the skeptical claims about GME even make sense?,"Alright, I'm not going to pretend that I have a deep understanding of finance, but some of the comments expressing skepticism about GME reek of pure bullshit. Here's some of the recent claims I've been seeing.

**1. The shorts have covered!**

The poster usually cites the massive drop in SI as reported by S3. Something like \~120% going into Friday, down to \~51% going into Monday. So, from a basic supply & demand analysis, this doesn't add up. Volume was relatively low compared to Mo/Tues/Wed and the prior week, most likely due to heavy restrictions (or outright bans) on buying GME shares on brokerages who ran into liquidity issues. If it were true that the shorts closed a massive portion of their short positions—purportedly \~70%—on Friday, then we would've seen a massive hike in price because shorts would've been scrambling to buy, along with the few institutional/retail investors who weren't restricted from buying. This basically would've been the squeeze. But that's not what happened. The price did increase, yes, but it didn't massively spike, not to the degree that it would have had the shorts legitimately bought back shares *en masse,* as is being claimed.

**2. Sure, but that just means that new shorts opened up at the top, that's why the price didn't spike to squeeze levels!**

No, this can't be correct. If enough new short positions were opened Friday to artificially suppress and ""hide"" the supposed *massive* covering of short positions, then the SI reported by S3 would not have gone down—at least, it would not have decreased from \~120% to 51%. At this point, claims 1 and 2 aren't even compatible. They can't both be true at the same time. My guess is shorts have been ""averaging up"" their short positions the entire time in a rolling fashion. Everyone knows the price will crash after the squeeze happens, so it seems unlikely that shorts who were willing to risk bankruptcy over this would suddenly throw their hands up, cover most of their positions (even if it were possible in this short time period) and then not take out new positions at the height to recoup losses on the way down. It would seem more likely that the SI hasn't actually decreased much at all, much less over the past 4 trading days.

**3. The shorts closed/are closing their positions this week! (Mo/Tues)**

Again, I don't see how this would work. How could shorts be closing *en masse* while the stock price is in free fall, like it has been the last two days? When shorts close their shorted shares, they buy the stock. So, if the claim is that they've been closing their earlier short positions this week, then shouldn't we realistically have seen an increase in price? Especially with Monday's low volume? At the very least, the price should've stabilized, not plummeted.

It seems literally impossible for a massive buy back of borrowed shares to have occurred over the past 4 trading days while SI supposedly plummeted **and** without the price spiking to infinity, especially when those days were relatively low in volume in comparison to the days leading up to them.  One or more of these claims has to be false, right?

Maybe they did massively cover and new short positions were opened to suppress/crash the price simultaneously. In that case, SI should've stayed relatively stable or gone up, not crash from previous estimates.

If the SI really did crash, meaning shorts massively covered their outstanding positions, then price should've erupted.

If we just ignore the estimated SI entirely and assume that the shorts covered a while ago, and the spike at the AH last week was ""the squeeze."" That doesn't make sense though because why would shorts have tried to exit by buying back shares at the height of international attention? Between the shorts buying mass amounts of shares to cover and the gigantic wave of new retail investors wanting to get in on the squeeze, the price would've exploded well beyond what was achieved because who the fuck would've been selling at that point? What seems more likely is that the AH was simply a result of the insane media coverage and bullish hype drawing in lots of new long investors, both retail and institutional.

Hopefully someone can explain what I'm missing because I feel like I'm going crazy reading all this skeptical shit when half of it contradicts the other half.  I realize there are legitimate concerns regarding GME moving forward, but it seems like much of the original squeeze thesis is still viable. Am I just retarded?   💎🙌",Discussion,0.93

This is all because of the market makers so do not worry, as this is typical and was seen all last week. Even if more restrictions will hit just hold and we will bounce right back up if the consistency of the holders stay unchanged.

&#x200B;

AMC going from +20% to remaining unchanged at 0% whilst GME goes to almost +10% and then remaining unchanged premarket at the exact same time will be the norm the coming time.

&#x200B;

Best advice is: hold and buy more as this is just the same garbage as went on as a result of the big hedge funds getting hit in the end of last week. RobinHood are still the puppy of Citadel and will keep on making this as scary for new investors etc.

Edit: I am all in on GME shares holding from 130.

Edit 2: no need to message me. Not a financial advisor. If you are worrired about any of the stocks on here the best thing to do IMO is to hold.

437,GME,lbvjzl,2021-02-03 20:14:52,Why I added to my $GME position in this dip,"So, if anyone has been doubting their interest in this company due to the recent dip (completely understandable, as some of us have bought the peak of the initial squeeze), today's news should show everyone that this company is poised to capitalize on their recent (free and insane) media exposure, and quite possibly looking to raise the required capital in the upcoming weeks to achieve their plans.

Source: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-03/gamestop-rebounds-after-new-hires-spark-turnaround-optimism](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-03/gamestop-rebounds-after-new-hires-spark-turnaround-optimism)

Back in 2020, Ryan Cohen has pushed the board of executives at GameStop to initiate the work to pivot the company's strategy in the upcoming years into a customer-centric, service-based, digitalized business aimed to position itself at the heart of the gaming industry. 

Although the C-level cohort is currently on media blackout due to upcoming earnings report, this new wave of hires confirms to me that they are serious and ready to commit to this transition. Simply music to my ears, which validates my thoughts that this horse is just getting ready for the real race up.

I'll be eagerly waiting for the earnings report, when I suspect they will give us the first hint of their strategy.

439,GME,l6os3d,2021-01-28 06:14:28,The $GME Short Thesis and how it could backfire if retail investors behave rationally,"So I'm seeing a lot of information out here about Melvin and 6 days to cover and all that and I think a lot of it is outdated. Actually, I know it's outdated because people were saying the same thing a week ago and $GME has risen like 300% since then. There's been a huge amount of price action, and yet the shorts everyone has been talking about have exited their positions and there's still tons of short interest. What gives? Why haven't the shorts learned their lesson? Are they just stupid? Maybe. But maybe not... Let's consider the short's view on this situation:

**The $GME Short Thesis as of 1/27:** Here's the scene. A stock which is widely regarded as colossally overvalued has doubled in value several times within a matter of weeks. You know that the retail investor plan is to force shorts into a squeeze scenario. However, volume is up to unprecedented levels as new traders flood into the market to get in on the action, so the days to cover is falling, making it easier for shorts to get out quickly when they get a window. Meanwhile, older long retail investors (aka bought like a day ago) are staring at what are, to them, very nice gains. It's been several days of insane price action already, and people are predicting the end is near because, well, it must be, right? The uncertainty and perceived risk of losing unrealized profits are very high.

You look at this and predict the following: **retail investors who have made tidy profits will sell upon a volatility move, causing a chain reaction of sell-offs**. In other words, you expect that the bubble is gonna pop upon sharp price action (could be either way) and then there's going to be a sharp decline as retail investors scramble to take whatever profits they can before the next guy sells at a higher price. 

So what do you do as a short with that thesis? Short the stock, of course! **Even if there's tremendous upwards price action the next day, you can just sell short again, pay off the old loan with the new short money, and now you're in an even better position.** Your best bet as a short is to short the stock the moment before the bubble pops. High interest rates from your lender don't bother you because, based on the thesis, you're only holding your loan for a few days and the share price on the other side is going to be way below where you shorted. This is why short interest is still strong - it's generally a good play to short a bubble that you expect to pop soon.

**How the Short Thesis could fall apart:** So, the whole short thesis is based upon the idea that retail investors are going to close out their $GME positions very abruptly as soon as they see some nice gains and sense that ""the end is near."" But here's the thing: what if they don't? As an investor in $GME myself, I did the following with my gains - I sold a portion of them to cover my initial cost basis and now I'm just sitting on the rest as ""house money."" I'm not buying in anymore because I'm managing risk, but I'm not pulling out because I think there's more juice to squeeze and I've got a lot of cushioning below if the price does start dropping. If this strategy is broadly applied by other retail investors (and it's a pretty classic and intuitive investing/gambling strategy), volume will slow down and the price will generally plateau. 

So as a short, aren't you happy that the price stopped rising? HELL NO. You need that price to either fall so you can close at a profit or rise sharply so you can roll your position up. $GME remaining tremendously overvalued at a steady price for a long time would be horrible for you as a short. You've taken out a huge loan, you're paying huge interest, and there seems to be no end in sight. This is how shorts playing volatility are forced to close at big losses - when the interest over time eats up all of their potential profits before volatility strikes. I think this is the scenario in which we'd see a true MOASS.

**Disclaimer: I am just a guy on the internet. I don't have specialized education in the market, but I think this is a pretty plausible thesis for the continued short interest and how the MOASS might develop. I could be totally wrong! Let me know what you think about it in the comments**

**The Shorts - The Side Show**

Let’s be honest, the real reason anyone is in WSB right now is to fist shorts. BCRX, however, is also a company that needs to gap up to reach fair value.  Fist the shorts and hold the gains.

Biocryst has a high and steadily growing institutional ownership [currently reported at 71%](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/bcrx/institutional-holdings). Biocryst has a float of 175m (124m of which are held by institutions), who are buying every share they can and not likely to sell any time soon.  This leaves 56m tradable shares. [The shorts have 30m shares or 70% of the tradable float.](http://nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=ShortInterest) This is not as big as the $GME naked short taken on by u/DeepFuckingValue. But, we think this is a stock that if it gaps up can hold the gain based on value. Institutions run an algorithm almost every day and short the stock (check the charts). We can make these fuckers squirm with the slightest effort.

**Orladeyo - The Prelude**

Orladeyo has recently been approved in the [US](https://biopharmajournal.com/2020/12/07/biocryst-pharmaceuticals-inc-nasdaqbcrx-receives-fda-approval-for-orladeyo-in-preventing-hae-attacks/) and [Japan](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/biocryst-bcrx-wins-japanese-approval-for-hae-drug-orladeyo-2021-01-25) to treat Hereditary Angioedema(European approval expected shortly). HAE is a rare disease that affects roughly 1/50,000 people, or about \~25,000 people in the three regions mentioned previously.

Orladeyo treats a rare disease and that means the medication is expensive. It costs [$485,000/year in the US](https://endpts.com/biocryst-wins-approval-for-hae-pill-and-charges-half-a-million-dollars-but-will-anyone-take-it/#:~:text=Six%20years%20after%20the%20FDA,BioCryst%20has%20notched%20another%20approval.&text=Despite%20inferior%20efficacy%2C%20BioCryst%20will,had%20projected%20a%20%24300%2C000%20tag.) and will roughly cost half of that in Japan and the EU. The company has projected they will capture 40% of the market [(page 15)](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/bcd71bf3-ef71-4803-81c4-edd4e33ebb38).  Capturing 40% of the market is a share price of [$70 when trading at a reasonable (if not conservative) 7x revenue multiple.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tLvclUzTqCitwKfawL7kGCLquJxA2T7IJKLg52VWotE/edit?usp=sharing) Work your own numbers and you’ll find SP should be more than $9 and the current market cap of 1.6 billion. FDA approval of Orladeyo enabled BioCryst to cross a bridge from a small unprofitable research company to expanding [commercial biotech](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4393550-biocryst-time-to-switch-hats-mid-cap-fits-now-maybe-large-cap) now engaged in execution.

**Factor D -  The Main Event**

Factor D is the blockbuster.  Full stop.  The company is already pursuing PNH but has indicated their intended subsequent targets for this drug. They’re small targets like “Lupus” and “IGA Nephropathy” along with[ 6 others (page 24)](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/41ee0771-0acc-479e-a39e-2842101c6aa9) and it’s already being hailed as [“best in class”](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3087617&headline=BCRX-BioCryst-has-potential-bestinclass-PNH-treatment-says-JMP-Securities)

So what’s this look like money wise?  Alexion’s drugs SOLIRIS® and ULTOMIRIS® are the current treatment for PNH those [make up 4.3B of their 5B revenues.](https://ir.alexion.com/node/22191/pdf)  AstraZeneca just bought them out for a whopping 39B.  If Factor D receives same valuation, that alone puts SP at $222 given our float.  [The sky is truly the limit](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tLvclUzTqCitwKfawL7kGCLquJxA2T7IJKLg52VWotE/edit?usp=sharing) over the next 24-48 months.  The point is, the company is ready to gap up on merit, but is being held back by high short activity.

**Galidesivir - The Wild Card**

If you aren’t already excited, maybe you’ll be excited by a drug [that provides 90% protection against Ebola](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320203179_Efficacy_of_Galidesivir_against_Ebola_Virus_Disease_in_Rhesus_Monkeys) when dosed 72 hours post exposure. Huge Ebola outbreak? BioTerror attack in a major city?  Think humanity might end in a pandemic more lethal than covid with people hemorrhaging blood from their eyes? No problem. Just distribute the [galidesivir](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/galidesivir) and most everyone will be protected. (Animal studies suggest high protection against [Zika](https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/4/suppl_1/S55/4294108), Yellow Fever, Marburg, [Tick Borne Encephalitis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31142664/) and others). 

Why didn’t we already have this drug?  That’s anyone’s guess, but politics seems to have something to do with it.  No one can yet determine the value or ultimate use of galidesivir as it is tied up in government development contracts. The company has already [stated](https://ir.biocryst.com/events/event-details/biocryst-third-quarter-2020-conference-call) that it is developing galidesivir for government contracts and shareholders seem to have little to do with this. So, we’ll just call this the sleeping wild card.

**FOP- The Feel Good Drug**

This is not a money maker. But, in case you haven’t found a soft spot for this company, they appear close to a first time cure for an extremely rare disease called [FOP](https://www.biocryst.com/our-pipeline/fop-program/). It slowly (and painfully) cripples children when their joints fuse together with excess bone. Children affected by FOP often end up wheelchair bound by age 11. Can’t tell you this drug will be a money maker as the affected population is too small. But, gosh, don’t you want the company to succeed?

**The Competition - The Class Clowns**

Disease:  Hereditary Angioedema (HAE)

For the prophylactic (preventative) market, the competitors are Cinryze, Takhzyro (from Takeda) which are IVF and subcutaneous injections respectively. Haegarda (CSL Behring) has a subcutaneous injection as well. Orladeyo recently received [FDA approval](https://biopharmajournal.com/2020/12/07/biocryst-pharmaceuticals-inc-nasdaqbcrx-receives-fda-approval-for-orladeyo-in-preventing-hae-attacks/) to be the first and only oral prophylactic treatment for HAE.

The patents of the competitors expire in 2032 and no generics are expected on the market before 2032. Orladeyo was granted extended patent protection until [2037](https://ir.biocryst.com/news-releases/news-release-details/new-composition-matter-patent-allowance-extends-protection). [Royalty Pharma](https://www.royaltypharma.com/news-releases/news-release-details/royalty-pharma-acquires-royalty-interest-orladeyo-and-bcx9930) did a deep dive on BioCryst’s expected Orladeyo revenues when it agreed to royalty financing that enabled BCRX to fast track Factor D development and expand it to 8 clinical indications.  

Disease: Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) 

Alexion holds the sole drug Soliris and its spin off Ultomiris (both IVF C5 inhibitors) to treat the rare blood disorder PNH. Alexion has market exclusivity until 2025 for Soliris. [This activist letter ](http://www.elliottletters.com/alexion.pdf)and [this article](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/alexion-moves-from-cfo-clancy-and-his-legendary-caution-does-mean-more-m-a-coming) highlight that analysts believe the 39B purchase of Alexion was a fire sale due to mismanagement. If Factor D received at least the same discounted valuation as ALXN, that would mean its market cap would increase from 1.6B to 39B. Excited?

Factor D is expected not just to be equivalent to Soliris, but exceed it. BioCryst Medical Director Bill Sheridan believes Factor D will make competitors [“obsolete”](https://ir.biocryst.com/events/event-details/39th-annual-jp-morgan-healthcare-conference) as it cures patients earlier in the disease process than C5 and C3 inhibitors. Unlike competitors, Factor D will also be both an oral pill \*and\* a monotherapy. In other words, there’s not much competition. Also, PNH is only the first of 8 serious illnesses expected to be treated by Factor D.

**The Insiders**

Still not convinced? CFO Anthony Doyle joined BioCryst April 02, 2020. Four months after joining the company he used $220,320 of his own money to [purchase shares in BioCryst ATM.](https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1808688.htm) As he is mortal like the rest of us, we assume CFO Anthony Doyle also pays taxes. Therefore, it appears as if he put the entirety of his after tax salary, for a whole year, into aligning himself with shareholders. Famed biotech investor Alex Denner has also been accumulating a passive position, ATM, right next to retail, [as recently as a couple weeks ago](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-bcrx-biocryst-pharmaceuticals-sarissa-capital-management-lp-sc-13g-2021-january-25-18652).

481,A,l7xj5z,2021-01-29 17:54:21,A Small Reminder of Some of the Risks Involved,"There is a prevailing mis-understanding among people fresh to the market that you can buy and sell as much as you want at the ""market price."" This is false. You are buying and selling from real people or algorithms that believe they can scalp your order. The idealized scenario is that GME rallies, Melvin covers, and everyone at reddit gets out at the top. This represents a misunderstanding of market mechanics. Melvin will cover before we truly know it, and the crash will happen as quick as the rally.

So with recent events, you must ask yourself:

# Who is Your Counterparty?

Nothing is a sure bet. How confident are you that your counterparty is who you think it is? Thousands of redditors & new traders beyond have been buying stocks fully confident that Melvin Capital hasn't  exited their trade. This is also supported by some analysis provided by two different firms, although their estimates differ some amount. Confounded in this is the interpretation of the data: Does this include market makers and dealers that are short stock but covered with calls or options deltas? Is their information fully accurate in an event the likes of which has never happened? It's tough to know for sure. 

# Know Everyone's Hand

Your guess on *how much they've covered* and *when they covered* has a massive effect on how you perceive the value of this trade. Buying if you think Melvin has $10b notional to cover is a much better bet than if they only have $2b to cover. You also have to consider how much notional the rest of the market has bought in anticipation of a squeeze. The difference between the two represents your effective edge.

Remember, we don't *actually* know Melvin's current position. We don't know what's going on behind closed doors. We only know the hand they're showing us via media. Has their clearing firm taken over? Has a much bigger collection of firms absorbed the position? Have they been buying since Monday? Have they covered and have new funds entered the space at a much better level? 

You are fighting Goliath at a poker table in the city of Gath. The pot is worth $25 billion dollars. Ken Griffin has *never* lost. Melvin's prime brokers Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche are not used to losing (well, Deutsche is). They will do whatever it takes to take the pot *from you* and leave you holding the bag. They will not blink twice because there is a *lot* of *fucking money* on the line.

# Know What Can Go Wrong

Nobody could have guessed everything that happened this week. Prepare yourself for the unexpected. Your brokerage will undoubtedly close out your position at the worst possible time. The stock could be halted for days. You could be assigned on ITM options. Your stock could get delisted. Your stock may get diluted.

# Only Spend What You're Willing to Lose

This one is self explanatory. Your investment could go to zero. Even if you think you make money on every trade, if your bet size is 100%, the long term value of your portfolio is **zero*****.***

# Don't Take Out Loans on Emotional Capital

If you are new, you really don't know the gut-wrenching, stomach-turning feeling of seeing the possibility of your net liquidity hitting zero or negative. It fucking sucks. You just know the highs. You're buying along the speculative frenzy and frantic rallies, wrapped in anti-billionaire & pro-underdog themes. It may even feel good to think that a guy who cut his teeth at a firm notorious for an insider trading scandal is getting his comeuppance. We love the feeling. **If you are fully invested financially & emotionally, you are completely overleveraged and will pay the price.** Make feeling good your goal, and set limits that you can stomach. 

There are several feel-good stories of people making life-changing money to pay off their student loans or their family members' surgeries. Please think twice about this, and only spend what you can afford to lose. If placing a bet makes the difference between your pet living or dying, you may have a gambling problem. These were success stories because they got in at a much better level and could have had a much sadder ending.

Secondly, don't take it personal. There are people on the other side of your trades, your brokerage support line, the subreddit, the media. They are all playing their own hand to the best of their knowledge. It's easy to blame a broker, yell at their support desk, hate-tweet at a company, or even rage-text that guy you know who develops APIs at ETrade. A lot of people across the industry are *rooting* for you. Fuck, even Ted Cruz and AOC are *rooting* for you, because this transcends politics. If you're mad at Melvin Capital or Ken Griffin or the guys who crashed the economy in 2008, keep it that way. They will try and misdirect your anger in every single direction: brokerages, the media, and reddit. If your enemies are a few guys at the top holding a $25b short position and moving levers, keep it that way. 

Thirdly, if you don't want to be a human being for the sake of the person on the other side, be a human being for your wallet's sake. You make better financial decisions in the absence of emotions.",Mods,0.86

484,BB,l3vs7e,2021-01-24 09:38:53,$BB Bear DD. The case against QNX.,"Listen up. It's hard for a gay bear to say no to some BB; however, I miss the good quality bear posts and I'm not taking any more of the glittery $BB DD lying down. This post is a critique of positive remarks made about BlackBerry QNX. This is not financial advice. Welcome to the casino.

tl;dr QNX is not high-tech, isn't primed for crazy growth and isn't something that can milk a monopoly position.  🌈🐻 

The retards with their bullish DD for $BB are getting off on explaining RTOS, the impenetrable security, the moat of standards, QNX's usage count, the EV & autonomous car revolution, and IVY. All of these points are weak and don't combine to create a strong bundle of sticks.  

**RTOS**  
Stop throwing around the term RTOS like it's magic. An RTOS is just OS that lets tasks ask to be run within a certain time. Engineering students spin up basic RTOSs in half-semester courses. Sure QNX is going to be vastly more complicated than a student project, but stop throwing around ""RTOS"" like it's secret tech.

**""It's so secure!""**  
Known vulnerability counts of a software can be low for non-flattering reasons: the software is not open-source, no-one cares to hack it, there arn't many features and the software doesn't change fast. I think that the autonomous and EV progress will increase scrutiny of automotive software and we will start to see some QNX bugs. In addition, the pressure on QNX to start adding features faster will also bring some bugs. Random speculation: I bet that there are some zero-day vulnerabilities of QNX known to organizations like the NSA.

**""But QNX has a moat! Look at all these safety standards.""**  
These safely standards are a shitty moat that will backfire. 
In general, I think safety standards for software are a joke. Check out this [PDF guide to ISO 26262](https://www.feabhas.com/sites/default/files/2016-06/A%20quick%20guide%20to%20ISO%2026262%5B1%5D_0_0.pdf). The standard focus on, among other things, to ""use style guides"" and ""use naming convection"" and ""restrict coupling between software components"". The whole standard seems like a joke.

One illuminating document I found titled ""Tesla comments on the cyber security regulation interpretation document"" ([source](https://globalautoregs.com/participants/409-tesla)) is Tesla making recommendations on how to update the W.29 standards. It has the following passage:

> ""We believe the current regulations and interpretations extensively consider the context of a traditional OEM ""model-year"" release rate, but do not factor in the perspective of a company that releases software at a faster rate than once or twice per year - similar to the model used by every other modern internet-connected consumer device. The current regulations and interpretations do not fully consider the overhead introduced to a manufacturer that releases software at a frequent pace. We believe is the direction the entire industry will move in, especially to address security and safety considerations. Any requirement to submit documentation, or wait for approval, for every individual software release will compromise velocity and agility; and works against the goals of a cyber security strategy. The regulation should be designed so it is based on evaluation of the manufacturer's internal processes, appropriate records of activities, and trust between manufacturers and authorities.""

Claims that Tesla is having difficulty passing these standards carry truth but are misguided; the standards are archaic and don't fit with modern software development and Tesla is contributing to these standards being rewritten. 

**""Look at the 175 million vehicles using QNX!""**  
Is this an argument for growth or for a monopoly? An argument for growth shouldn't be ""QNX already has a large % market penetration"". In comparison, the growth argument for EVs and self-driving cars is that there are hardly any now, and in 30 years most cars will be EVs with self-driving capabilities. If QNX has X% of the market now, I need evidence for why this will grow. Instead, if you are arguing that QNX has a monopoly, this also seems flawed. A quick google finds other companies have automotive platforms, such as GreenHills software which claims also to be ""Proven in Hundreds of Millions of Vehicles"" and also meets the standards such as ISO 26262. 

I'm pretty sure nearly every car released in the last 20 years runs an OS of some sort. It's used to run tasks like like controlling the breaks, turning on your window wipers, lights, sound etc. RTOS is already a fundamental requirement of cars. Saying things like ""EVs and self-driving cars means BB to the moon"" is like saying we should invest in air bag companies because of strong growth of EVs and self-driving cars.

**BlackBerry IVY**  
I don't get how this is huge news. The press release is vague on the details.  What actually is BlackBerry contributing here? What does BlackBerry get? 50/50 of what? Amazon wants everyone using AWS and will be happy to make deals to get people onto AWS. My guess is that AWS just needs a partner to figure out a good way to design some good APIs for car data. BlackBerry will be useful to AWS for a few years and then discarded. 

**Talent**  
Bullish $BB DD doesn't even cover this, and it's probably one of the most important factors. A software companies long term advantage is it's strength to attract top talent. I don't see BB being able to compete in this game at all. I encourage people to check out some of the reviews of [BlackBerry QNX on Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/QNX-Software-Systems-Reviews-E9037.htm). It seems that most employees enjoy working an QNX but think that the parent company BlackBerry is dragging them down. Poor QNX doesn't even have a separate careers page—you get redirected to BlackBerry's career page which mixes all of their departments together on one page. Furthermore, looking at LinkedIn profiles of [current BlackBerry QNX employees](https://www.linkedin.com/company/blackberryqnx/people/) shows that the developer workforce is heavy on the old-guard and doesn't seem to have much young top-tier talent. If $BB can moon, maybe it can attract more talent, but currently, I think talent is going to be a serious issue for BlackBerry QNX.

**Parting sentiment**  
QNX will either continue to be a low level RTOS that moves your window wipers, or they will be squeezed-out as car companies or companies like Cruise or Deep Scale develop their own low-level OS or use an open-source one. I bought BB in the hype and I think there is a strong case for it being undervalued, but I place a low probability on BB becoming some automotive superstar based on QNX. 

Position: I have 160 BB shares.

When other investors see that we aren't just trying to play these stocks, but that they are icons, trophies in our war chest, they will join with us. I believe that no strategy beats buy and hold, especially when other investors believe that idea too. I won't trade this stock, I believe in what AMC represents: the rebellion against the 0.1% that will refuse to let them off easily for plundering coronavirus relief funds, causing the housing market crisis, and more.  


62 shares GME, 400 shares AMC and 3 $40 02/05 calls. To my future children reading this in 10-20 years: aren't you glad I didn't sell a single share? :) 💎🖐",Discussion,0.97
486,PLTR,l431h4,2021-01-24 17:53:28,Benzinga claims PLTR is running solely because of us.,"Here is a quote from a Benzinga article released Friday, ""PLTR shares are trading higher on above-average volume amid continued volatility in the name stemming from increased popularity amongst traders on Reddit's Wall Street Bets community."" 

This is one of the most concise points made in an article I've read in a while, and they simply don't list any of the other catalysts for the stock. No mention of Cathie Woods accumulating shares, no mention of demo day on the horizon. No mention of the float structure and Mithril potentially buying the locked up shares. 

Seriously, who writes this stuff? It's almost like the chief editors of every financial publication agency are telling people to only write about WSB. This is really weird and it gives me the heebie jeebies. How can someone claiming to be a professional financial publication simply omits so many key facts about PLTR? Stuff seems borderline criminal. Anyone reading their article to get investment advice or info on PLTR got literally nothing. All they get is go check out r/wallstreetbets. Who the fuck is paying these writers?",Discussion,0.98

492,A,lahmei,2021-02-02 00:34:11,Concerns about this sub. A cult-like mentality is starting to form. And its dangerous,"So preface, I'm not a bot and my positions are short on the S&P 500. I think this GME squeeze will cause a liquidity crisis so the market corrects. So GME going up is good for my account.

I've been on this sub for a few years and its rise in popularity the last few weeks has brought some concerns to me. Namely that this sub has the potential to drive some serious cult like behavior. 

This GME squeeze is an interesting story, it started out as a play to make a metric fuckton of money and has grown into some weird psuedo-social movement, or at least disguised as one. You have people new to trading (As seen by the constant questions asking basic questions about the market) on this emotional trip to steal from Wall Street and give unto themselves. In an era with a lot of uncertainty due to the rona I get it. 

My concerns now is there seems to be a quickly rising culture of if you do not love GME you are a bot/dissenter/evil wrongdoer with the intent to take the ship down. And I agree there has been a lot of not so legitimate people here the culture is slowly turning to join the hivemind or go. I am already seeing people talking about ""our next target"" as if this is now some group intended to take down wall street from within.

This sub has made this short squeeze a little guy vs Wall Street thing, and while there is plenty of shady shit going on, people don't seem to understand there are institutions long GME, they want to take Melvins money just as much as you. It's a short vs long battle. 

That whole Robinhood fiasco, it was a legitimate issue handled HORRIBLY. They ran out of money and were going to go insolvent, and they handled it quite possibly the worst way, adding even more fuel to this us vs them fire.

""It can't go tits up"" -  Words someone says right before it goes tits up. A lot of you all will make life changing money off GME, and I am glad for you. But you also have to understand for a lot of yall, you're going to lose. The market giveth and the market taketh away. I've blown up my account twice so I've gone through the emotional rollercoaster before. I remember my first 10 bagger off TGT when $BECKY was memeing. I am worried that for those people this GME play goes tits up on, someone will wrongly focus that energy into being someone else's fault and not them not understanding the play they were making.

This sub has grown exponentially and the mods have been doing there best, however this one tweet definitely added fuel to the fire in my opinion, 

https://twitter.com/wsbmod/status/1356338243554304001?s=20

I think this perpetuates the message that its someone else's fault GME went down today and that the ""elites"" are out to get us.

This is reminding me of an Alphabet soup themed cult. And we all see how that's going.

This sub was always about making money and being dipshits doing it. And I am worried that culture is going to transform into something much much worse. My biggest fear is that people who blow up their account off this play are taken advantage of by others and lead down some crazy shithead path.

Edit: I can't blame the mods for this. There is no handbook on how to handle every news outlet picking up your subreddit. They've been doing the best they can and I applaud them.",Discussion,0.81
