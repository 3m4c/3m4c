3,DD,lb4e2m,2021-02-02 20:40:03,Part 3- $BB DD no Meems – FUCK THE MEMES,"If I have to see another fucking message about today’s drop I’m going steal some $ROPE from all the $GME bagholders so I’m going to address some questions here. FYI [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamg0y/bb_dd_no_meems_part_1/) and [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamill/bb_dd_no_meems_part_2/) of this autistic $BB diatribe [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamg0y/bb_dd_no_meems_part_1/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamill/bb_dd_no_meems_part_2/), not going to keep answering the same questions.

As many in the #BANG GANG have always known, $BB becoming a meme stock has been a **mixed** blessing, to say the least. to say the most, it's fucking sucked.

Look at this chart. Look at this fucking chart. I don’t need to run a regression, let’s be just as retarded as all the candle-stick reading dipshits with a Bloomberg terminal (*#Ben Graham GANG# FOREVER AND ALWAYS)* \- Look at the lines, and how they’re moving together. Try to wrinkle that smooth brain of yours for a second.

**Why THE FUCK would an (a) Endpoint / digital security company, a vidya retailer (yeah, sure they sell funko pops too now great ), a movie chain (half of you morons have 3 streaming subscriptions and last I checked you’re not allowed to watch in your underwear while getting tendie crumbs everywhere @ AMC), and some Fininsh 5(g) provider (I don’t know a fucking thing about NOK) move in tandem other than just being meme stocks on this fucking board?**

By the way - There's been a ton of great technical analysis posted on the others in $BANG. the short squeeze on GME was real and a once-in-a-lifetime catch and i respect the hell out of it (and am also a sad bagholder of a few shares). It's just that the reasons for liking each of the stocks is different.

For better or worse - There was a post, I can’t find it but somebody else can, that showed the Robinhood dashboard that basically said the three most commonly held shares in any given account was, you guessed it $BB, $AMC, and $GGME.

As you know, Mark Cuban took a break from his busy calendar of being the least retarded Sharktank (No offense Daymond John, I have a soft spot for FUBU but my wife’s boyfriend no longer lets me rock it) and touching tips with Luka Doncic to [answer some questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lawubt/hey_everyone_its_mark_cuban_jumping_on_to_do_an/). Somebody asked why $GME was taking a nose dive off of Mt. Everest. Per Cuban -

*Supply and Demand, but in this case it literally could be because the source of demand has been crippled . When RH shut it down, then cut it back, lets put aside why, they cut of the greatest source of demand. They created a RobinHood Dive. No RH buyers, means sellers lower their price to find buyers. And they keep on lowering it till they find buyers. Keep the most natural buyers out of the market and the price keeps on FALLING.*

*Then that drop accelerates because the more the stock falls the more owners who bought on margin get margin calls. When that margin call happens, its brutal. They just take your stock, send you a fuck you note and sell your stock at the market price, no matter how low. They just want to get your cash to pay back the loan.*

So. Two things re: $BB’s volatility.

# #1 Stopping buys (but allowing sales) tanked $BB, just like it tanked the other meme stocks. The tin foil apes can keep hawking about citadel etc. but the truth is likely that RObinhood is a tech-focused firm with shitty financial controls and even shittier risk management (GUH). Never ascribe to malice what is usually (and always with that shitshow of an excuse of a company) incompetence. Those dumbasses had a liquidity problem and solved it in the worst way possible. I hope their IPO fails and Vlad steps on a lego.

# #2. The current free fall of $GME / $AMC is still dragging $BB down. Why? What happens when people get margin called? Their entire account sells off some or all of a portion to satisfy the account. For those of you more discerning retards you know that the same thing happened to the hedge funds last week.

**It’s called** [**degrossing**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-30/a-reddit-army-descends-on-hedge-funds-chained-by-risk-models?sref=NJllTNWZ)**,** and is what caused the broader market to perform **inversely** to $BANG.

*BTW - It was really fantastic for me to watch my MSFT calls get fucked because of the morons of this sub. Satya Nadella daddy dicked earnings and the stock (along with the whole fucking market) was down…Live by the retard, die by the retard. But look at the bounceback this this week, when all the hedge funds looked around and said – Wait, J. Powell is still printing money like Zimbabwe and stocks only go up.*

***What do you think will happen once things calm down, the stimulus checks hit, and retail investors start looking around again for stocks they might like?***

So now what? Well, I REPEAT, **wrinkle that smooth brain of yours. What does #1 and #2 have to do with the** [actual reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4ehan/blackberry_dd/) **that #BANG GANG likes $BB?**

If you said – ""Huh, not much"" then congrats you’ve evolved slightly beyond a retarded monkey playing at a slot machine and shitting out sub-par memes.

**TLDR - $BB WENT DOWN TODAY BECAUSE OF FACTORS SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO ITS STATUS AS A MEME STOCK. $BB $BANG GANG EATs WILD DAILY PRICE SWINGS FOR BREAKFAST. THE BIGGEST LESSON OF GME / AMC IS THAT RETARDS TOGETHER STRONG. ON THE OFF CHANCE THAT ENOUGH RETARDS BELIEVE, IT EVEN HAS A CHANCE TO ROCKET AGAIN IN THE SHORT TERM.**

**TLDR the TLDR - $BB #BANG GANG IS IN FOR THE LONG HAUL. WE’RE TERRAFORMING MARS, AND TAKING MATT DAMON WITH US.**

POS – balls deep in $BB shares, planning to buy more today

35,GME,l6os3d,2021-01-28 06:14:28,The $GME Short Thesis and how it could backfire if retail investors behave rationally,"So I'm seeing a lot of information out here about Melvin and 6 days to cover and all that and I think a lot of it is outdated. Actually, I know it's outdated because people were saying the same thing a week ago and $GME has risen like 300% since then. There's been a huge amount of price action, and yet the shorts everyone has been talking about have exited their positions and there's still tons of short interest. What gives? Why haven't the shorts learned their lesson? Are they just stupid? Maybe. But maybe not... Let's consider the short's view on this situation:

**The $GME Short Thesis as of 1/27:** Here's the scene. A stock which is widely regarded as colossally overvalued has doubled in value several times within a matter of weeks. You know that the retail investor plan is to force shorts into a squeeze scenario. However, volume is up to unprecedented levels as new traders flood into the market to get in on the action, so the days to cover is falling, making it easier for shorts to get out quickly when they get a window. Meanwhile, older long retail investors (aka bought like a day ago) are staring at what are, to them, very nice gains. It's been several days of insane price action already, and people are predicting the end is near because, well, it must be, right? The uncertainty and perceived risk of losing unrealized profits are very high.

You look at this and predict the following: **retail investors who have made tidy profits will sell upon a volatility move, causing a chain reaction of sell-offs**. In other words, you expect that the bubble is gonna pop upon sharp price action (could be either way) and then there's going to be a sharp decline as retail investors scramble to take whatever profits they can before the next guy sells at a higher price. 

So what do you do as a short with that thesis? Short the stock, of course! **Even if there's tremendous upwards price action the next day, you can just sell short again, pay off the old loan with the new short money, and now you're in an even better position.** Your best bet as a short is to short the stock the moment before the bubble pops. High interest rates from your lender don't bother you because, based on the thesis, you're only holding your loan for a few days and the share price on the other side is going to be way below where you shorted. This is why short interest is still strong - it's generally a good play to short a bubble that you expect to pop soon.

**How the Short Thesis could fall apart:** So, the whole short thesis is based upon the idea that retail investors are going to close out their $GME positions very abruptly as soon as they see some nice gains and sense that ""the end is near."" But here's the thing: what if they don't? As an investor in $GME myself, I did the following with my gains - I sold a portion of them to cover my initial cost basis and now I'm just sitting on the rest as ""house money."" I'm not buying in anymore because I'm managing risk, but I'm not pulling out because I think there's more juice to squeeze and I've got a lot of cushioning below if the price does start dropping. If this strategy is broadly applied by other retail investors (and it's a pretty classic and intuitive investing/gambling strategy), volume will slow down and the price will generally plateau. 

So as a short, aren't you happy that the price stopped rising? HELL NO. You need that price to either fall so you can close at a profit or rise sharply so you can roll your position up. $GME remaining tremendously overvalued at a steady price for a long time would be horrible for you as a short. You've taken out a huge loan, you're paying huge interest, and there seems to be no end in sight. This is how shorts playing volatility are forced to close at big losses - when the interest over time eats up all of their potential profits before volatility strikes. I think this is the scenario in which we'd see a true MOASS.

**Disclaimer: I am just a guy on the internet. I don't have specialized education in the market, but I think this is a pretty plausible thesis for the continued short interest and how the MOASS might develop. I could be totally wrong! Let me know what you think about it in the comments**

# THEY CALL IT GOD'S GREEN EARTH BECAUSE BY THE END OF THE SQUEEZE YOUR BROKER WILL BE SO FUCKING BRIGHT GREEN SUPERMAN WILL HAVE KYRPTONITE PTSD

My fellow GME brotheren. Friday is the night (or day). Tomorrow we head for our mission to finally get the money we deesrve. Unlike most of you (wether fortunately or unfortunately) I've been bagholding GME since 10. I saw myself through multiple ups and downs. I have gone through around 4(four) low, low, low -30% swings (the fourth being today's). If tomorrow goes well, the shorts will have such a ridiculous demand coming from the suspension of GME in brokerages, demands of the r/wallstreetbets brotheren, and Elon Musk, Chamath, and A-O-FUCKING C will skyrocket our diamond hands.

&#x200B;

Last time there was a ""dOnT gIve mE awArds"" post it got $18,000 worth of reddit awards. If you woudl have spent that on long dated, april calls (aka when GME was around 17) you would have broken 6 figures and would probably be in Millionaire status. **GME is our stimulus.** Those fat ass republican (& Democrat) motherfuckers didn't want us to give $1200 checks so we're taking $10,000 instead.

[🚀🚀🚀](https://preview.redd.it/didzepevr6e61.jpg?width=1214&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f349bd1c568c33b4d8ccbcac49e829d36dc5baf7)

The institutions have always made fun of us, they thought we were just a trend in the stock market that would come and go. THEY thought they could get away with breaking families in 2008 while earning just enough money to get another Yacht, this time gold-plated. NOW this is a movement. While unfortunately this wouldn't make these zillionaires broke, these motherfuckers are going to take us seriously. This wont be a cat and mouse game anymore, this will be an elephant seal vs elephant seal $GME now.

&#x200B;

Our lord DFV was just a regular value investor before he started to dive deep in GME. Loving person with a wonderful family. Now he is breaking an 8 figure net worth after being told off on his YOLO ""You're not gonna make it"" they said. If GME goes to $1000 (Which could be a possibility) this motherfucker will be 9 figures and I would never be more happy. He got me into GME first, shortly after Ryan and his goon squad arrived.

&#x200B;

So tomorrow, open your parachutes. Be ready for shorts trying to attack, and high volatility if that's the case. If the squeeze does not happen by tomorrow, worry not my fellow GME bretheren. Just DIAMOND HAND and HOLD until we get to our promised land. I wont argue if we can also tank to $0, but remember, it's not just for the money. It's for the message.

I'll keep it short and sweet. $NOK is almost certainly a fucking plant, meant to bait you all into buying.

- High float, low price, perfect for retail to pile into
- It's not shorted much at all
- People only started mentioning it *very* recently last week. Out of the non-GME recent meme stocks ($AMC, $BB, $NOK), it's the most recent.
- Retail has gotten fucked on $NOK in the past
- The 5G thesis is great, but it's old fucking news

But OK, all the stuff above is more or less conjecture, let's assume I'm 100% wrong as an unreformed 🌈🐻 (still think that market crash is coming BTW), here's some signal [take another look at the stocks that Robinhood has restricted and how severe the restriction is](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-due-to-recent-market-volatility/) (as of 1/30):

| Symbol | Allowed Share purchases | Allowed Option Purchases |
|---|----|---|
| $GME | 1 | 5 (minimum of any of them) |
| $AMC | 1 | 10 |
| $BB | 1 | 10 | 
| $NOK | 5 | 10 | 

Which one of these is not like the other? $NOK is basically the least restricted (on both dimensions). I'm personally not super convinced on $BB either but meh.

Just like most other posts on WSB, this is not financial advice. Make your own investment decisions and know when to sell, because when the squeeze ends it will end fast -- make sure you and your friends talk about and exit strategy, we want to sell into Melvin, Citadel, and their friends, not each other. Once liquidity hits zero it would be great if someone started a count of how many shares were bought at the elevated prices.

I will echo something I read in another post here -- for all the 4MM new people here, **WSB LOSES MONEY ON AVERAGE**. We post and celebrate loss porn. $GME is the only safe bet right now, it will be green even in a sea of red because what's happening right now is mechanical, assured. The shorts have not completely covered yet, and they will. It's not about fundamentals, it's not about technicals, it is market mechanics.

[EDIT] People in the comments suggesting I haven't been on this sub long enough to understand why each individual stock is squeezing. Let me lay it out (please let me know if I'm wrong) so people stop suggesting that

- $GME rocketed because short squeeze + gamma squeeze
- $AMC rocketed because short squeeze + gamma squeeze + recent 900M cash infusion, Bankruptcy is 100% off the table
- $BB rocketed because of optimism around security, lack of compromise in Solarwinds
- $NOK rocketed because 5G, and some idea of being under valued (this one I admit I don't understand)

Shut the fuck up about it. If you know the above this post isn't for you.

This post exists to *dispel the fiction that half of these are legitimate short and/or gamma squeezes*. If you thought that $BB and $NOK were short squeezes, YOU ARE WRONG. They *MIGHT* gamma squeeze but certainly not with the restrictions on them.

[EDIT 2] It looks like people are still confused about brokers. There are three brokers that I can recommend, if you're trying to express a view on this market:

- Fidelity
- Vanguard
- TD Ameritrade ([see their restrictions](https://www.tdameritrade.com/td-ameritrade-trading-restrictions-stocks.page))

If you're thinking ""You're a fucking plant, how could you recommend TD Ameritrade?"", calm your tits. I have been posting since last week about the *actual* restrictions that are in on TD Ameritrade, fucking read them -- **you *CAN* buy $GME and $GME calls on TD**. The media misreported and never actually listed what the restrictions were for TD (they were one of the first to restrict).

NOTE: I DO NOT KNOW IF TD WILL CHANGE IN THE FUTURE, SO THE SAFEST ARE FIDELITY AND VANGUARD.

Also, I will shill for TD a bit -- when I dumped RH last year because they cost me money, I moved to TD and they forced me to do their education stuff on options and shares and futures before being approved for level 2 options (I'm not a fan of lying on my applications to financial institutions). I actually really fucking enjoyed it and learned a lot. I don't know how they're going to change since they merged with Chuck Schwab, and you could say that all their ""education"" schtick is actually just bullshit to convince you that you know what you're doing *before* you give the big boys your money, but I really like TD.

See my previous comments about TD's actual restrictions from when I called them, on the phone, like a boomer:

They're just trying to lower the price so they can:

1. Cover at the lowest price possible
2. Buy the shares they need to deliver by TODAY for all the calls that were exercised Friday at the lo
3. lowest price possible

&#x200B;

**There is no way the real short interest percentage is 53% but even if it is, THATS STILL HIGH AF!** You think these greedy HF's are just going to cover and then leave the stock alone? Right now they think they have you on the ropes so they're tripling down and shorting this shit on the way down! You know what that means? They're shorting it at $115 instead of $450 which is WAYYY more risky. It's super easy to justify $115 fundamentally for GME without even taking into consideration the squeeze.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**We're in a desert right now and the HF's are dying of thirst and we have the water.** Are you going to sell it them at a loss for peanut? Fuck no! These guys have screwed us over for so long and we're going to give in and let them win? There is no way in hell that if we just hold that we don't go to the moon.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**How many of the sales today will turn out to be failures to deliver?** They're literally selling fake shares right now to drive the price down and we're not going to believe their BS! They're eventually going to have to pay back these shares and we're going to make them pay OUR price for them.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Buy low, sell high!** Do you have cash in your account? Buy low? When you're buying you should probably feel a little hesitant, that's how you know you're getting a good deal! Holding shares? Don't sell! You're supposed to sell high not sell low you dumb fuck.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**This will be the defining moment of this sub.** You better believe that the smart money on wall street is buying right now. Are you going to join them on this rocket ship to the moon or are you going to pussy out and step off the spacecraft right before take off?

Yesterday I posted a DD on Tilray and why it was headed to the moon. Link below.

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lail27/tlry_dd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

I’m returning today to inform everyone about how the $TLRY and $APHA merger happening Q2 will work. 

Based on the terms of the merger, $APHA owners will receive 83% of their $APHA shares as $TLRY stock. For all you smooth brains, this means that $APHA should be 83% of whatever $TLRY stock price is on a given day. This is currently not the case.

I have predicted that $TLRY will moon based on short interest and other DD. Link above. This means that $APHA is discounted and will follow this move. So smart money will buy $APHA to take advantage of this discount along with the impending moon of $TLRY.

Hope this helps. Don’t miss out. I have linked a screenshot of shorts in $TLRY below.",DD,0.79

That being said:
I know y'all retarded apes don't want to read, but bear with me here. 
The current fact we all first need to acknowledge is that the price of GME has dropped significantly, and that the volume, albeit still low, is higher than yesterday to say the least. People have started to sell, and other where on Reddit people are starting to belief this thing is all over and we're a bunch of cultists.
Now the question I know y'all want to know: Is it over yet?
Short answer:Likely not, but it depends on us.
The very basis of the reason many of us believe GME with go to the moon in the first place, that it is HEAVILY shorted, *still holds true*. According to the volumes for the last few days, the restrictions still going on, and the media fake-silver hype, the HFs likely haven't covered their positions yet. Many of them likely even added new ones, as they believe the price is going to fall. The potential for going to the moon is always there, it never changed. What has changed, and can potentially truly wreck this spaceship, is our mentality. Due to the price drop, which, started with the HFs with their dirty tricks, people are starting to panic, and this panic, which is caused by a false manipulation, CAN wreck GME. People are less likely to buy in as they're afraid this is not ending well, and people are more inclined to sell due to the dropping and seeing all the other people selling.
*Spamming 💎🙌💎🙌💎🙌 will NOT stop people from selling or panicking. It only serves to make them think we're a cult*

*What to do*
What is important as of now, whether you're still in, already sold, or has been speculating the whole time thinking this is over and all these poor cultists are going to end up in shit. Is to understand, and not just blindly belief, that *the stock is still heavily shorted, and this fact NEVER changed*. If we all understand this fact we *win*. The only potential source of this failing is our doubt amongst ourselves. I urge everyone to take a deep breath, and ask yourself: *Do you really belief that the HFs are truly out?* If the answer is no, than the best thing we can do is to recollect ourselves, regain the faith(which should not be blind faith but faith backed by reason) we had in each other and in this stonk, and HOLD AND BUY. 

TLDR
*Our whole reason of doubt is our own doubt. The entire thing is a self-fulfilling prophecy. If we all believe we win we win, if we all believe we lose we lose.(Yes this includes you bystander, we are all in this together) The fundamental reason the we believed GME is going to the moon has NEVER changed. HAVE FAITH that is BASED ON REASON. Blind belief is NOT solid, and can only get you so far*.
The stock is at a low, and this is a great opportunity if you sold earlier to get back in again. If we come together and have faith in reason, we have a greater chance than EVER to send this to the moon, wreck Wall Street, whatever you're in this for at the beginning.
*Unity and belief in reason, not fear, makes us strong*
*GME TO THE MOON BUY AND HOLD*

To rebuild faith in reason: 
-Welcome discourse, don't call everyone a bot
-Actively engage in discussions and focus on the fact that the stock is still heavily shorted as ever
-Spam less emojis, more rational discourse, appear more collected so people don't think we're a bunch of crazy cults sinking with the ship",DD,0.96

This is an extension of my DD series on GME. If you haven’t read them and have time, they will provide some background on my previous predictions, some of which have already come true. In this post, I’ll share my thoughts on what I think is going on, plus some tips to manage your positions and exits. 

**TL;DR:** Shorts are in but likely want to get out. And they want to get out at the best price possible. See tips for managing positions.

# What’s happening with the price? 

### We’re still gamma squeezing

Many media outlets are reporting this as a “short squeeze”. They’re only partially right, as [if Melvin isn’t lying they’ve already been squeezed out](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/gamestop-stock-short-sellers-melvin-capital-citron-surrender-bets-gme-2021-1-1030010382). 

However, the reality is so far we’ve been Gamma squeezing - repeatedly - and some shorts have been casualties along the way. 

See [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2t9bf/gme_i_think_this_is_a_gamma_squeeze_where_dealers/) for a deeper explanation, but the essence of it is that market-makers have to buy shares to hedge the calls they sell. The more calls people buy, the more shares they MMs have to hedge with. As I explained in [part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/), GME has ultra low liquidity, i.e. there’s **waaaay fewer actively traded shares than what shorts need to buy to cover with**, and then when you get lots of people buying calls and shares in the hot new stock it just **removes more availability** from the market. 

As a result, when MMs buy shares to hedge, it moves the price of the underlying up. Combine that with the buying pressure of people piling into a stock climbing 100% a day, shorts getting liquidated, and it’s a perfect storm. 

Today, GME closed at $347 (before the after market selloff, but i’ll get to that soon). 

320 calls were added yesterday. Similarly, when 115cs were added we squeezed to >115 in two days. Same story with 60c’s etc.

Remember this commentary from [EndGame part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l528pz/gme_endgame_part_3_a_new_opponent_enters_the_ring/) on Friday’s price action:

*Notice how the stock dropped from a high of $75 on Friday to below 60 - the highest expiring SP for the 1/22 options, and* ***stayed tight in range for the rest of the day****. Now, for compliance reasons, MM are required to be neutral by EOD, so 20 minutes before close, MMs had to buy back all their short positions, which led to the strong close above 60.*

*All this led me to believe that the* ***real fair market price for GME was above $65.*** *Without the market makers interference, GME would have closed higher.* 

Now, what happened today? We opened at **$351, more than double the previous close of $145** and after the morning profit taking, we squeezed to a **high of $372** as MMs furiously tried to hedge the 320 calls they sold you the day before for peanuts. 

See, the thing is, [Kenny G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_C._Griffin) doesn’t like to lose money. The magical method Citadel’s market makers make money, is that they sell you call giving you the right to buy shares at a certain price, say $320, for the nice price of $10/share (for example). Now, as long as Citadel’s MMs can buy all the shares they have to give to you for less than $320, that $10 is free money. However, when the underlying moves too fast, the MMs have to buy shares for more than $320, and **Kenny G does not like that.** 

Today was a shock to the MMs that sold all the 320cs yesterday. A ***six-sigma event after a six-sigma event after a six-sigma event***. Yet again, within days (a day?) of offering new, higher strikes - **every call option ever sold was in the money, before they had a chance to adequately hedge.**  

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cq5wy45433e61.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c75a1e1a6e3808b54bafc646e2e6a7f29ca7cc3

So, just as on Friday, if the price got too high above **$320**, market makers dug into their bag of tricks to start selling it off. (People taking profits here helped too.) However, multiple times, when GME went **below $300**, MMs took their opportunity to hedge the 1/29 calls. So, just as before, *we traded in a tight range around the highest strike.* 

My conclusion from this action the first time was that **GME’s fair price was being actively suppressed**, and **it proceeded to 5x** in the next few days. There’s a possibility we’re in a replay and will see more upward movement on delta hedging alone.  

The point of this is: I think shorts are feeling the squeeze, for sure, reporting [massive mark-to-market losses**.** ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/gamestop-short-sellers-squeezed-losses-reddit-traders-army-cohen-palihapitiya-2021-1-1030006226) **But I believe the shorts are still in.**

### Shorts are still in

As of Wednesday morning, Ortex was estimating a **short interest of 65M shares**, down from 71M shares the day before.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ze8wx15633e61.png?width=932&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a034dbb3c54509c6267f20c4122ecdf3f6cf4bc

If you’ve read my Part 1 ([DTC Infinity](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/)), you’ll hopefully recall my thesis that there are actually less than **24M** shares available, and therefore that it would be nigh impossible for shorts to close. Since then a slew of new investors have piled in to **buy and hold** GME, from little guys like us to big-ass-whales like [Blackrock](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000083423721001340/us36467w1099_012621.txt) **increasing their holdings to** **13% of GME.**

So what? I think the available shares for shorts to buy **are down to under 20M, and they have to buy 65M shares to close**. *Shorts have barely begun to cover.* We’ve only been increasing the cost of their exits!

Now, let’s talk about Melvin Capital. I loved watching Chamath defend retail investors and argue against the institutional leveraged shorting that got us here in the first place, but I also learned something interesting that helped me understand how the 140% short interest had in the first place, and how the unwinding may go. 

At [2:10 Chamath says](https://youtu.be/DYZHtF-tV0k?t=135) “*Gabe Plotkin is one of the giants of our era, but at the end of the day, what happens is that his trades are copied by umpteen other hedge funds that follow along* ” 

This tells me 2 things:

* A lot of hedge funds (likely [Maplelane](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/hedge-fund-maplelane-loses-about-33-on-short-bets-this-month), [D1](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/dan-sundheim-s-20-billion-d1-capital-loses-about-20-this-month), [Viking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_Global_Investors), [Point72](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/27/business/point72-gamestop.html), and more) followed each other into this short. Much like retards like us get behind good DD shared in the open, these institutional retards got together with their cigars and golf clubs behind closed doors and decided together to go in together against GME. 
* If Melvin is really out, it’s unlikely the other funds are going to want to stay in, lest they be compared poorly to Melvin if GME continues to go against them. **The other shorts want out.**

Chamath also tells us that prime brokers (the brokers that hedge funds use) are seeing [**“the biggest 4-day degrossing from hedge funds they’ve ever seen”.**](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354646282678149127?s=21)

**Again, the problem is - there just aren’t enough shares.** Shorts have dug themselves a massive grave by shorting more shares in existence and continuing to short while Cohen grabbed up 9M shares, institutions added to their positions, and retail traders piled in.

For [**boomers like this tard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgYZk9Mc804) that can’t understand why the price is so high - go back to Econ 101, supply and demand bitch. 

# It’s costing shorts incredible $ to hold their positions

Here’s all the ways shorts are losing money.

* They pay borrow fees to loan the stock. At one point today, the GME stock borrow fee [hit 250%](https://twitter.com/zerohedge/status/1354646088221913089) for new borrows. At $300/share that’s $2/day. That doesn’t sound like much right? What if you shorted at $50? 
* The short position on GME has ballooned to **$25BN from a low of $1B.** *The borrow fees are applied to the latest closing price, not the price you shorted at.* 
* Funds are paying **interest fees on the margin they are using for the short**
* And oh yeah, GME’s up like 800% in 5 days. 

# Dirty tactics continue

At this point, I think “THEY” have figured out that gamma squeezes are absolutely destroying hedge funds. So what do they do? 

* **THE BIGGEST DIRTIEST TACTIC OF ALL - they only allow you to sell, not buy. HEY SEC, WHY ARE SHORTS STILL ALLOWED TO SHORT WHEN LONGS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO BUY. WHY ARE INSTITUTIONS ALLOWED TO COLLUDE?**
   * **This is insane. Funds, prime brokerages, and market makers all stood to lose money so they disabled trading of GME due to ""volatility"". Citadel invests in Melvin capital. Then brokerages shut down buying!**
* Brokerages down
* Options not loading
* Restrict retail trading on GME
   * **I’m seeing reports that retail buyers not allowed to hold more than 100 GME options now**
   * &#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/is4qn8n733e61.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=741f80fc182e27584954691ebb581ffee15f86ef

* This is a direct defense against more gamma squeezes and an **attack on retail investors, giving institutions a distinct advantage.** 
* **HEY Shortsellers Enrichment Corporation** \- how is it ok for [Citron to buy thousands of puts minutes before their tweet](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/) and how is it ok for prime brokers to give hedge funds 10-100x leverage, but the little guys can’t have more than 100 options total?  
   * Personally, I don’t really do 100s of options all at once but now I really want to. Fuck this. 
* More short ladder attacks. Look at after-hours trading on GME - a rapid short ladder attack during low-volume trading in order to bring the price down. 
* **If you use stop losses on GME and leave them on, you will get stop-loss hunted.** 

&#x200B;

Ripple effects of the squeeze

* These hedge funds that are short GME, are also short other equities like BBBY, AMC, etc. 
* These hedge funds are also long other shares with leverage, so the ONLY way they’re staying alive and not covering their shorts, is that they’re **reducing their long leverage. This means selloffs in the broader market** as they have to shore up their margin requirements against the massive short squeezes in their portfolios.

# I believe we’re at a tipping point

* I don’t believe shorts have really covered yet. They have defended by getting capital infusions and reducing their long leverage. I.e. they have begun liquidating long positions. 
* If GME climbs more, they will be **forced to cover and liquidate.** 

# Things to be careful about

As you can see, this is no easy win. In addition to the [suggestions I wrote about in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/), here’s some things to be careful about. 

* **There are threats to halt trading. Shares are safe, they do not expire. Calls can be destroyed by tactics like buying halts.** 
* **Be careful about swapping ITM calls for OTM calls:** it can be tempting to trade-up your options for higher return, but be mindful of the delta impact. You may actually be driving the sale of shares by MMs when you don’t mean to. For example, if you sell a .5 delta call for 2 .2 delta calls, that’s net reduction of 10 shares that MMs have to hold long as leverage. 
* **Be careful about being short any calls this week:** Not only do you limit your upside (which is dumb in the prospect of a squeeze), you could end up in a nightmare scenario. A call that ends OTM on Friday could end up ITM after hours if you didn’t sell it, and you may get assigned while the underlying continues to go up. **Close spreads if your short legs are deep ITM** unless you want to risk early assignment and high hard-to-borrow fees. 
* **There are a few other dirty tactics shorts can play.** I’m not specifically going to share them here because I don’t want to give the ideas circulation, but 
   * **Choose your own limit sells based on personal sell points.** Don’t copy others and don’t try to be memey. Make your own decisions. 
   * **Stop sharing your positions publicly.** I know this is anti-wsb, and I think sharing them is great for this community, but in the case of GME it’s an **attack vector** for you. 
* **Be careful of holding weeklies until expiration.** Remember the multiple trading halts? What if trading gets halted on Friday at 2pm and doesn’t resume for the rest of the day? **All your 1/29 calls would expire worthless. Depending on your broker and your cash positions, maybe even your ITM ones.** Roll (or sell, if you’re taking profits) your weeklies well before expiration. 
* **Be careful about buying on margin.** Brokers are rapidly increasing margins. If you bought on margin with 2:1 leverage, and the stock went up 100%, you’d be in margin call even without a margin change. If the broker moves margin against you, you’ll get to margin call faster. 
* **Don’t bet more than you can afford to lose.** I’ve been in GME long enough to know that just when you think going up is a sure thing (remember last Monday with the short sale restriction?), you can be surprised by a new trick. If you bet it all on weeklies all at once, you may not be able to recover from being wrong on the timing. Consider longer expiry or spreading your purchases out. I’ve held through multiple 30-40% drawdowns in the underlying; and **held through a 50% drawdown today**, so you need to be ready for the volatility. 
* **Watch out for stop loss hunts.** It’s common practice for shorts to hunt for stop losses for cheap shares. If you’ve set a stop loss, be really sure about it. 
* **Don’t sell on dips.** You’re only helping the shorts. If you need to sell to take profits, sell when it’s heading up. Sell high, not low retards.
* **Save dry powder to buy on dips.** Dips manufactured by shorts are buying opportunities. Take advantage of folks with paper hands to capture shares at low points. GME has incredible daily volatility. Set a low limit buy and just wait for the order to fill. Have patience when buying.

This is not financial advice; do your own DD. I’m holding over $1M in shares and calls.  **I AM NOT SELLING WHEN THE BUYING MARKET HAS BEEN REMOVED. YOU ARE BOUND TO NOT GET A FAIR MARKET PRICE.**

**Update** New ortex data shows 51M short interest. So the covering has begun.

**Update 2:** what you are seeing in the price drops is likely the gamma squeeze in reverse. People are rightly selling their short term calls, so MMs are selling shares they bought to hedge. That drives the price down, which then causes more de-hedging. This is all a manufactured selloff by elimination of ability of people to buy the equity and should absolutely be investigated. It's very likely the big boys knew the buying restriction was coming and started the selloff last night.

**Update 3:** getting angrier by the minute. Reviewing the volume and price action and shorts bought in volume at the absolute bottom.

Here's my **personal** DD on PLTR, you're welcome to read and do whatever you want. Other helpful info or pointing out mistakes in my DD is very welcome.

Fears preventing you from buying PLTR

1. Targeted ads on your phone from Yahoo Finance or Zacks telling you PLTR = BAD!!!1!eleven
2. Shills spamming ""pLtR tO tHe MoOn"" and :rocket: on PLTR thread comments.
3. Last quarter's seemingly bad financials/earnings.
4. Financials Moving Forwards
5. Soros who owns 21 million shares ""threatening"" to sell his shares upon DPO expiry.
6. DPO expiry 3 days after February's earnings and possible insiders and DPO holders sale and dip.
7. What does PLTR tldr.
8. Other Information

&#x200B;

***#1 Targeted Ads***

Ads and articles are both paid for by someone.The fact that in the past 3 weeks i've been getting multiple multiple targeted ads on my phone related to PLTR since i love PLTR so much.

Ads are telling me that PLTR is bad, doesn't provide a dividend, they're telling me PLTR's fair price is 20 instead of 25 based on some financial model and have gone as far as to provide a list of alternative stocks to buy.

To me, this all screams: **SCARE TACTICS**

Additionally, the last few weeks of ups and downs in PLTR's stock price is another indication of the attempts to short the stock to sh!t and drive investors out. (For what reason? I don't know.)

&#x200B;

***#2 Shilling PLTR***

I myself love to shill PLTR to people whenever i can. I do this because i legitimately think this company will do great. I work as a product manager in a software development house and understand what PLTR does. PLTR is not cryptic.Regardless, i think when people shill PLTR to you, they are right to do so as you're probably missing out on a great opportunity to make money in the long run. If you're looking for big gains short term, maybe try something else.

Shillery is OK, but at least give the facts.

&#x200B;

***#3 Last Quarter's Bad Financials***

If you'd done your DD not by searching reddit posts but by checking PLTR's actual quarterly report, you'd know that PLTR's ""bad"" last financial quarter/earnings were due to the costs of listing themselves on the *New York Stock Exchange*.\~855million were spent on listing and stock related compensations and this is the big reason.

**Direct quote by PLTR here:** [https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx)

>We incurred a loss from operations of $847.8 million, which includes $847.0 million in stock-based compensation following our recent direct listing.

I would like to remind everyone that this is a **1 TIME THING.** Put simply, this means that PLTR won't have as excessive losses next quarter as they did this last quarter.

*Additionally*, let me go into further detail on this and not just leave it to that.

* ***PLTR's quarterly operating expenses for the past 3 quarters were at around \~260 million.***
* ***PLTR's operating expenses this quarter were \~987 million.***

ADDITIONALLY...

PLTR also had a higher R&D cost this quarter that just passed. Normally they'd pay 80 million on R&D, but somehow ended up paying \~300 million this quarter. No one knows why, but this is another thing that influenced PLTR's earnings.

[https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx)

>On September 30, 2020, in connection with the Direct Listing, we incurred $769.5 million and $8.4 million of stock-based compensation using the accelerated attribution method related to the satisfaction of the performance-based vesting condition for RSUs and growth units, respectively, that had satisfied the service-based vesting condition as of such date.

&#x200B;

***#4 PLTR financials moving forwards***

PLTR is deep in bed with the government and the Biden regime although may look like it would be against using PLTR is in fact secretly very pro-surveillance e.g pro Palantir.

Here's some of the known organizations in the US Govt that use PLTR:

1. CDC
2. Office of the Secretary
3. Food and Drug Administration
4. Immigration and Customs Enforcements / ICE
5. Internal Revenue Service / IRS
6. National Institute on Drug Abuse
7. DOD/ARMY - ACC Aberdeen Proving Ground
8. Coast Guard / DHS
9. DOD/NAVY - Naval Information Warfare Systems Command
10. US Attorney's Offices / DOJ
11. US Special Operations Command / SPEC OPS

Boys. The big institutional people know these things. You just found this out. See how deep PLTR is already in bed with the Government?????? Palantir IS the next Raytheon/Lockheed of DATA aggregation and visualization.

***UPCOMING EARNINGS***

I've done some quick maths and it looks like PLTR is more likely to be in positive earnings this quarter and with a 0.02 cent EPS target, we can easily assume that they'll destroy this with maybe 0.04 or 0.08 EPS. In the worst case scenario, PLTR's EPS this quarter could be somewhere around MINUS -0.05 ish due to interview costs and ad/campaigning costs that were not there before the company was listed.

***WHAT CAN DESTROY PALANTIR***

Now, there's big possible downsides and Palantir can fail IF contracts that expire are not renewed. That's biggest REAL reason for Palantir's balance sheet getting screwed.

I've seen a disturbing pattern with PLTR's financials and that's that every year, it's R&D cost is rising by between 150 and 350 million dollars. This is quite a bit of negative revenue and if new contracts are not constantly coming in, PLTR's balance can start going into the negative.

***WHAT WILL NOT DESTROY PALANTIR***

Some people may have concerns over the new left leaning government dumping PLTR. An article was posted that is behind a paywall EVERYWHERE that goes something like this:

[https://www.thedailybeast.com/cdc-officials-urge-biden-team-to-dump-palantirs-covid-tracker](https://www.thedailybeast.com/cdc-officials-urge-biden-team-to-dump-palantirs-covid-tracker)

In my opinion, i believe this is inconsequential and that a few people crying to daddy Biden to kill a multimillion contract with PLTR is a stretch. Also we know the current new Biden team has his hands full and will have them full for at least the next 1 year with what's going on.

There is no time to deal with a few crybabies and even if he did deal with it and did decide to kill the PLTR Tiberius Covid tracker contract with the CDC which he WONT, these things take months and years to deal with, and by then the contract/s will have already brought PLTR tons of money and revenue in.

***HOW MUCH DOES KARP AND HIS GOONS GET PAID***

Short answer is... A LOT. The amounts below are PER YEAR. That's a lot of money in the hole and contributes to annoying amount to why PLTR is always just at the edge of just barely being profitable.

https://preview.redd.it/ba58nqcurob61.png?width=2615&format=png&auto=webp&s=55d45833faad4d60ea8dc142a9601c44b4cc7395

Palantir's prospectus 311 page document's 130 last pages are almost all exclusively talking about extremely complicated options trading schemes that are made by Cohen and others to make sure they can squeeze out a LOT of money out of PLTR.

Mithril Investments has existed from before and is not a new company. Owned by Thiel/Cohen/Karp as a way to launder and exchange options for more options and more money for all 3 of them. Also Shyam Sankar to me feels corrupt which scares me a bit, he's had some very shady dealings and has brought his wife in PLTR that gets paid 200k per year.

Prospectus Document: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm)

I suggest you skim through it, it contains EVERYTHING about Palantir.

**Palantir is going to need to have to be getting AT LEAST 500 million in NEW contracts per year to REMAIN BARELY profitable. It's doable in my opinion, but just barely and it's why they made the company public to try and get more people's attention and increase the inflow of contracts.**

&#x200B;

***#5 Soros and his 21 million shares***

First of all, i think we can all agree that Soros can suck it.

If you've read a few articles here and there, you'll know that Soros owns/owned 1% of Class A PLTR shares. No one knows whether he's sold them yet or if he's an DPO holder who'll sell 3 days after February's earnings.

Whether he sells them or buys more will be mostly inconsequential in my opinion. We see dips and pumps every day. He legally cannot sell his shares all at once, he'll have to sell certain amounts daily and over time. This will create annoying sideways motion as shares exchange hands and consolidation starts for 2-3 weeks until his and insider shares exchange hands.

Nothing special to see here, move along just a little draw down resulting in some consolidation.

PLTR is exposed to OIL more than anything, so fluctuations in the general market and general market crashes affect PLTR much less than other stocks. Also PLTR does not track ANY benchmarks. NONE.

&#x200B;

***#6 DPO expiry 3 days after earnings in February***

To my limited knowledge, this is how BIG plays who are holding DPO shares usually work:

* If a stock has performed well up to earnings and investors are more than happy with the returns, they're more likely to not sell their stock or just sell less than they normally would.
* If a stock hasn't performed as well as investors thought, these investors are more likely to sell stock or reduce their positions more than normal.

There's a total of 1.16Billion Class A PLTR shares currently (Give or take don't flog me). We are currently trading with \~250 million shares while the rest are locked away in the DPO.

When those shares are ""unlocked"" in February, the price of the stock won't be diluted. These shares already exist and are accounted for. They are simply locked. Also when they are unlocked, the share price won't simply multiply because all shares are now tradeable.

>According to [Palantir’s after-hours filing with the SEC this afternoon](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520257973/d89036dex991.htm), the company has 1.16 billion Class A shares, 484 million Class B shares and 1 million Class F shares on its cap table outstanding today, or a total of roughly 1.64 billion. Only Class A shares will trade, and Class B and F shares are convertible to Class A shares on a one-to-one basis. On a fully diluted basis, which Palantir says represents 2.2 billion shares total according to its most recent S-1 filing, the company is valued at $16 billion. The difference between those two aggregate numbers comes from outstanding stock performance grants, warrants and other financial instruments.

What **WILL** affect stock price:

* Employees exercising their non class A options into Class A shares. This IS dilution.
* The bigwigs e.g Alex Karp, Peter Thiel and a few other bigshots exercising their options and then selling them for a profit.

*To note, regular employees will barely affect the price of the stock with their miniscule share holdings. Alex Karp, Peter Thiel and a handful of other high ranked executives in PLTR are the ones that will create a tiny but manageable ripple in the stock price.*

What **COULD** affect the stock price a lot:

* Massive sell off by the big institutional holders.
* Not shorters. (Citron and Citi can suck it, we're in control here)
* People with weak spaghetti wet paper hands.
* Everyone fomoing the same weeklies e.g like when everyone bought Jan 15 calls on everything.
* Big but silent scare campaign (that's already going on) to scare off normies like us.

&#x200B;

***#7 What does PLTR do, tldr.***

Imagine Facebook's database of everything about everyone & Youtube's Database of everything & Geolocation data in a database made by the US Army for known terrorist cells.

Palantir allows you to select and match varied data TYPES from several different database, combine it in any way you want and visualize it so that it's human readable by even the dumbest person in the room so that even they can see patterns and come to conclusion on a subject matter.

It's kind of like filling an excel sheet with data and then visualizing it with a bar chart, except the date you filled the sheet with can be anything and not just numbers or dates or countries and you can make various combinations using all the different rows of data to maybe come up with a pattern to something like how to best distribute the Covid vaccines in the counties in a very specific state in the US.

Literally what you see in SciFi movies where people combine random data by smashing keys on a keyboard and somehow find the murderer, the location of a terrorist or the percentage that someone will commit a murder in the future based on a lot of random data about that person or the area, country, family, history... anything.

While this all might sound super cool and amazing, it is. Maybe in 10 years time there will be a few more companies doing this, but for now, it's only Palantir, Circles, Alteryx and a few other private entities that do this type of thing. Many of them work with governments and are hush hush due to the kinds of things they use this type of software for (terrorist cells, warzones, etc) and the public backlash this could cause.

tldr: Glorified data aggregator and visualization platform/software with different access levels for different people.

**PLTR is superbly positioned to offer their software to SLOW and Boomer like organizations like Governments.**

Governments are stupid and don't have neither the time, nor technical knowledge to develop this software themselves for internal use. This is what PLTR capitalizes on and why Governments use them so much.

Governments could have spent the a fraction of the money they spend on PLTR contracts to make the software themselves but only for their own internal systems and use, but they can't and if they tried, they'd fail because technocracy in governments is not a thing. By the time they'd even complete a project like this, it'd likely be out of spec, unusable and would require further development and money and we know how slow and bad governments are at doing even the basics. Again PLTR wins because of this.

**PLTR is likely NOT** to be adopted by giants like Google or FB or other modern tech organizations of any size because they are not stupid. They have their own purpose built internal systems that they use to do everything related to data aggregation and visualization because they have the technical knowledge and resources. Buying PLTR for their use is a joke.

PLTR capitalizes on being general a general purpose tool and is set up manually by an engineer over the course of 4-10 days for each customer. The engineer customizes and configures the system for each company's custom use since the software allows you to do so. Regular aggregation and visualization software CAN do the same, but typically lacks data input types and features that PLTR has because PLTR has cultivated a special set of features over many years that were suggested by their existing clientele in battlefields and other places.

&#x200B;

Now friends, here's my position on PLTR. I'll be holding onto it for the next year. If it's not at least 300% by then, i'm selling it and moving on to the next stock. App i'm using is Revolut.

Also yes, i'm ALL-IN only on Palantir because i know my money will multiply itself in the short term. I'm not holding this till 2025 as others are supposedly doing. I'm selling in 2022 with 300% or more profit. PLTR is severely undervalued, underpriced because it's a DPO. Give it till EOY and we're going to be rich. If it was an IPO it'd be trading at 180+ already imho.

I've spent the last month and a half holding PLTR. I've gone full schizzo mode when it comes to PLTR. I lose sleep daily and i love it. I hadn't slept for 37 hours a few days ago because i spent so much time researching PLTR and scraping the internet for all possible information.

I come from an IT/Development background, so i understand what PLTR does completely.

My PT's for PLTR are:

* 48-89 by March or April.
* 75 - 125 by EOY.
* 200+ 2022 IF they solve their income and constantly increasing R&D cost issues.",DD,0.98

78,GME,l0yzb5,2021-01-20 02:54:24,A Venture Capital Perspective on GME,"Hi everyone.  Long time WSB lurker and I've learned a lot here, so I'd like to give back and hopefully add some value to this sub.  I think it’s worth spending a little time laying out my thoughts on why I’m investing in GME as an active early stage VC, and hopefully my insights can help people not paperhand before the real gains are made.  I'll try to provide new insights that I haven't seen on this subreddit yet.

Full disclaimer- this is my personal money I’m investing.  Positions are 678 shares at a $39.81 average as a starter and looking to open a more significant position in the next few months once a few questions have been answered for me on things I’m looking to see (which I’ll discuss below).

Obligatory rockets: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀.  If a few things happen, this goes to the moon regardless of a short squeeze.  I'll explain why below.

First, a quick overview at how most VC's do due diligence.

**How VC's Invest**

When we do due diligence on early stage investments (our Fund is a pre-seed and seed Fund with a few Series A deals), there’s a few things we look for, especially when evaluating growth companies in tech are as follows:

1) What’s the market size? There are three types of market sizes investors look at; TAM, SAM and SOM.   Feel free to look up how sizing these markets works if you aren't familiar, this is a long post so I won't waste people's time.  The important thing to remember here is that **the larger the TAM, the more room for growth and competition and the more interest there is to invest in a space.**  This is very important for GME and we will come back to why later.

2) What's the CAGR?  (Compound Annual Growth Rate).  Basically, is the market expanding or shrinking, and how fast.  Again, google this if not familiar.

3) Experience of the management team- have they actually been there before and demonstrated an ability to scale and exit a company in this space?

4) Unit economics- do the numbers make sense as this company grows?  Is it actually going to be profitable?  Every firm looks at these different.  We look at CAC/LTV ratios and doubling time with tech companies.  The TLDR of this is ""how much money does it cost me to get a new customer, how long will they be my customer before they leave, how much money will they spend while they are my customer, and how fast can I double the money I spent on advertising to get that new customer "".

There are a lot more things that obviously go into determining whether something is a good investment or not, but if there are red flags in any of these core areas a tech company is almost always uninvestable.

**Now onto why after recent developments I think GME is shaping up to be one of the most attractive investment opportunities that investors have seen in these markets in years, but why many of you will miss out on the majority of the gains long term.**

1 and 2) Market size and CAGR.  As a gamer myself in spare time and a tech investor this is a market that hasn't even scratched the surface of how large it will get.  Gaming is a market worth hundreds of billions, with an explosive CAGR as more young people grow up with gaming being a socially accepted activity and in many people's lives the center of their social experience.   Most of you are familiar with this already, so nothing more to be said here.  

Now the question in the past was, is Gamestop capable of growing their share of this market?  Until Ryan Cohen, the answer was no (and this is why the share price went down to where it was).  Again, you all know this.  But this leads to the second point of why it is now an attractive option

2) Ryan Cohen.  Not from an ""excited about a memeing CEO"" perspective, but from the most important thing to institutional investors- does he have a proven track record scaling and exiting profitable e-commerce businesses?  Yes he does.  

Again, you all know all this and it is how the stock price got to here today.  Everyone is sitting waiting and watching to see if there is a short squeeze (myself included), and there is a lot of hype and excitement.

**But this is leading everyone to miss the forest for the trees because of the 4th point:**

GME's Unit Economics have the potential to be best in industry, yet shares are priced at an extreme discount to revenues currently.

I'd encourage everyone to check out this article talking about how companies with strong growth are normally priced by tech investors by one of the A16z partner.  [https://a16z.com/2020/08/17/role-of-entry-multiples-in-valuations/](https://a16z.com/2020/08/17/role-of-entry-multiples-in-valuations/)  The article is titled ""why entry multiples don't matter"" and helps entrepreneurs understand how valuations of companies can make sense for tech investors.

The short of it is for all the WSBers who can't read: if you have more growth, you get a higher multiple because you will have the potential to produce far more dividends faster, especially in high margin tech companies.

So what is fascinating about GME?

**If I was presented a new company that had just driven it's e-commerce revenues 300%!!!!! YoY, operating in a several hundred billion TAM, backed by investors and management who had grown a company in the same vertical to hundreds of millions in annual subscription revenue, and with a strong balance sheet and distribution footprint and a widely recognized brand, 20x topline revenue in the early stages would be considered a steal to invest at.** 

Instead, GME is priced at a $2.8B market cap, less than half of annual revenues.

This is an unheard of valuation for a growth company to be trading at a discount.

So why is GME underpriced, and why did so many people (myself included) not see or continue to not see this opportunity until now?  If it's such a good opportunity, why are shares so cheap?

**Most investors are looking at the legacy Gamestop business that has existed for the past decade instead of treating GME like a new startup (CHEWY for Gaming).**

If Ryan Cohen can transform GME into a subscription-based membership model where in exchange for your monthly fee you have a one stop shop to all things gaming discounted, you have a company that could easily be valued at a 10-30x multiple on top-line revenues.  However, because most investors outside of this subreddit still view it as a traditional brick and mortar play vs. a subscription focused tech company with omnichannel growth strategies, they think a bubble is forming and are shorting it instead of buying in.

**So why am I not all in yet but why am I excited?**

The most important thing yet to be understood is what does the customer value proposition look like under the new direction Ryan Cohen takes GME.  Most large investors will be waiting to see how over the next year the balance sheet is strengthened for growth, what new revenue models can be implemented, and to see if there has been a true pivot from brick and mortar.

This is a company that if management can execute on correctly, most large institutional investors will be clamoring to get a significant stake in and grow it because the gaming market is here to stay and grow.  Bear arguments that digital game sales will hurt GME miss the entire point of the pivot.  Ryan understands this and wants to instead bring the whole gaming experience in house- everything you buy you want to buy from GME because you're part of their membership program (again think Costco).  Those programs are insanely profitable and if the unit economics show that to investors as the company pivots the valuation will soar immediately as people realize it's Amazon Prime, not Blockbuster.  However, it is yet to be seen if they can execute on this vision, which is why I am not all in yet.

There is still long term risk which is why this stock is still low.  Not a lot but there is some.

Maybe the company doesn't grow?  Maybe they reject Ryan's vision?

But here's the bottom line.

If a shift to digital first does occur, and GME becomes a subscription first omnichannel gaming company, the market cap will conservatively be 10x topline revenues.

Let's say that stays flat next year at $5B.  

This market cap (matching industry standards) **should for an appropriate valuation for a growth stock be $50B.** 

I know this sounds insane.  But if Ryan can complete the transformation he is hoping for this is a very conservative valuation.

A $50B market cap would be $800 a share right now.  Again, this assumes Zero topline revenue growth.  If revenue begins to grow again 10x will be unrealistic and the multiples will get far higher.

This is why the short squeeze is distracting many.  **In 5 years if you diamond hands this company, the fair value of shares can range from $800-$2400 and not be in any sort of bubble or unjustified by fundamentals speculation.**

TLDR; this company if Ryan does what we believe he will may be one of the most undervalued companies this subreddit has ever discovered.  Even if you take profits in a short squeeze, don't forget to keep shares for a long position because opportunities like this rarely come around.  I imagine the short squeeze will allow them to issue more shares to  strengthen the balance sheet, and the company has a fantastic launch pad to start from with the size of it's existing customer base, brand awareness, and revenue. If it becomes clear that GME will be executing on Ryan's vision even at a $10B market cap this will be a steal and I will open a full position then.  I am waiting to expand my position to see what happens with the pivot, as this all goes out the window if GME rejects his strategy.

As always, do your own DD but I have learned a lot about options from this sub and hopefully this helps a few people understand why selling shares may end up being the biggest regret of their life.  **GME's business model has the potential to look just like Amazon's with a focus on the gaming industry and these shares are only at this price because the market is still looking at the old company and not the new startup that GME could become.

Edit*- I wrote this prior to the squeeze that happened.  You all know the explosion the price saw.  My diligence was written for those investing under $40.  I’ve gotten a lot of DMs.  My thesis has not changed that this was a discount at the time I wrote but I am not opening a significant position until I understand what Ryan Cohen’s vision for a turnaround is.  I am also not holding at the moment and had taken profits last week when I couldn’t justify the market cap for the current company under any circumstances and it began feeling like a pump and dump. I will be looking to reopen my original position between $20-$30 and then look to see what the vision for the turnaround looks like before adding more.  This is in no way financial advice and do your own diligence.  I stand by my long term vision for this company IF and only if I like Ryan Cohen’s turnaround plan and pivot to a business model with attractive margins and potential for strong growth.",DD,0.98

82,GME,l8m1oj,2021-01-30 14:48:14,GME Shorts Will Try to Buy From Longs Over Weekend - Discuss,"Good morning retards. 

I've broken out my robe, my pipe, and my helmet so that we can sit down and contemplate the most singular and engaging question of our time:

> If you were a short what would you do if you were SUPER fucked but you knew in two days you were going to be SUPER DUPER fucked? 

That's the question that we're faced with this fine Saturday morning. But let's do a quick review of the facts to understand where the shorts are possibly at before trying to answer that one.

**Current short situation**

* According to the DD floating around here we're still at 100% short interest - at least.
* Melvin and Shitron say they're out of their positions. But are they? 
* Doesn't matter. New shorts are still short and will be forced to cover. 
* We saw liquidity dry up Friday with a bid ask gap of like thousands at one point
* Shorts launched multiple short ladder attacks
* Reports of whales coming in an buying up the shorts shares during the attacks, short can't keep that up
* If shorts can't short attack because of the whales hoovering up their shares, what can they do? They have to buy eventually.
* ~~Oh and then there's the big gamma squeeze coming from Friday.~~ Ok looks like the gamma squeeze may have occurred [already](https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8e9f3/read_this_if_you_expected_a_huge_gamma_squeeze/). Thanks to /u/BlueEstee for that DD - they definitely have more wrinkles on their lobes than me!
*~~All call contracts expired ITM Friday. Any naked calls must be covered. More importantly - MMs will be forced to gamma hedge existing contracts for further out expiration. They do this by buying shares.~~
* Retail is now buying out of spite. Which is the best kind of investing I think.
* I chew crayons. I put that together from what's here. If I did you know the shorts brokers did as well. Margin requirement increase anyone?

tl;dr shorts current situation

> They are SUPER DUPER fucked early next week because of the incoming gamma squeeze, likely increasing margin requirements, whales getting involved and of course continued retail interest.

Much of this is a summation of DD by /u/jkn_ku so read their post if you want a REALLY good blow-by-blow of Friday with some really keen insights on order flow sniping and things I had no fucking clue about: [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l7qlfh/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity_pt_3/).  I know, I know, /r/investing but goddamn if that isn't some killer DD and it reads like a fucking action thriller. Respect.

**But what's the shorts next move?**

The shorts have had a lot of tactics to scare off retail - ladder attacks, PR blitzs, lots of bots, etc. But they have ONLY ever had one move - the move they HAVE to make eventually. And that's of course to buy back the shares they owe their brokers. They're under contact to do so - it's the law.

But that's what will cause the MOASS and force them to buy from retail, right? That's what we want?

Yes! But there are other longs out there other than retail - institutional longs. These are usually big companies or funds who purchase gme for long term strategies. We haven't talked that much about them.

Here's a list and the amount of shares they own from an Investors.com [article](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/gme-stock-gamestop-investors-instantly-make-16-billion-gamestop-stock-squeeze/).

I want to be clear. Longs only represent 51.m shares. And many of these are funds that probably cannot sell due to their fund balancing requirements and what not (I don't know - just guessing there). 

Shorts are shorts AT LEAST 100% according to all of the DD we've read. They still have to buy ALL of retails shares. There is no way that I can see for them to avoid doing so. But they WILL try to lessen the pain. 

And these institutional longs are seeing BILLIONS in gains (with a B) so who knows what could happen.

So I am speculating that the shorts will approach institutional longs over the weekend for some sort of deal. So keep your eyes and ears open and helmets strapped on tight!

This is not investment advice. Don't take investment advice from the internet.

Positions: 1000 shares bought @ 16

APES TOGETHER STRONG.

EDIT: Thanks everyone for the awards but please save your $ for gme shares. 

EDIT2: For those of you doubting the willingness of Longs to sell NOW to avoid more volatility, consider that a large gme shareholder - MUST - sold off their entire stake this [week](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/large-gamestop-shareholder-must-asset-management-sold-off-its-stake-2021-01-28).

83,GME,l6te9s,2021-01-28 11:18:32,My brokerage wants to force close my GME calls,"My brokerage called me and asked me to close my 115 calls expiring this friday. If I wouldn't close them at todays market open, they'd do it, and they'd do it for all customers with GME options expiring this friday. I could open a position expiring next week if I wanted to.

&#x200B;

Their reasoning was that I didn't have enough cash to exercise the calls and they don't know if trading of GME will be halted for some time in the next few days. Therefore my calls would get exercised with my balance in the negative.

&#x200B;

Now, I'm fine with closing the position and rolling it out to next week and a higher strike, since I also have a ton of shares. But this still sounds fishy to me, like they wanted to minimize the amount of shares they'd have to buy to hedge for another gamma squeeze. They told me I ""also had other positions that were heavily covered in the media, but those were fine, GME realls is a big exception right now""

1. Cover at the lowest price possible
2. Buy the shares they need to deliver by TODAY for all the calls that were exercised Friday at the lo
3. lowest price possible

**There is no way the real short interest percentage is 53% but even if it is, THATS STILL HIGH AF!** You think these greedy HF's are just going to cover and then leave the stock alone? Right now they think they have you on the ropes so they're tripling down and shorting this shit on the way down! You know what that means? They're shorting it at $115 instead of $450 which is WAYYY more risky. It's super easy to justify $115 fundamentally for GME without even taking into consideration the squeeze.

**We're in a desert right now and the HF's are dying of thirst and we have the water.** Are you going to sell it them at a loss for peanut? Fuck no!

**How many of the sales today will turn out to be failures to deliver?** They're literally selling fake shares right now to drive the price down and we're not going to believe their BS! They're eventually going to have to pay back these shares and we're going to make them pay OUR price for them.

85,DD,l99eep,2021-01-31 10:58:44,DD about Melvin closing their position 🚀,"TLDR: Looks like Melvin did close their position, but it wouldn’t affect the squeeze.


DD:

I dug up Melvin SEC filing and saw that they have 5.4M GME shares put in Sep (an increase from 3.4M shares in June) https://sec.report/Document/0000905718-20-001111/
Most likely their short position is around the same or up to 7M in December, but I doubt they have a much larger position than that.


Melvin claimed that they covered their shorts on 01/27. GME’s price on 01/27 is ~$360, so it cost them about $2B to $2.5B to cover. This matches the bail they got from Citadel. Also LB, one of Melvin’s top holdings had a violent dip on 01/27 - this could mean Melvin had to liquidate some other positions to cover. Melvin has another SEC Filing due Feb 14 for December, so we will have a better idea about their number.


S3 reports that short interest reduced by 5M shares https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355194252674953219?s=21 on 01/27. This matches with the shares Melvin covered.


This means there are still 58M shares that are not yet covered. What we are seeing in the last couple days are the tip of the iceberg, the squeeze will be much more violent in the next couple days if we 💎🖐 

I don’t think that many of these are new short positions because:
1. Shares are incredibly hard to borrow at this moment
2. Hedge funds tend to target low risk high ROI stocks. This means easy/cheap to short shares with negative sentimental


Bottom line: hold on tight 💎🖐 because we’re gonna go for quite a ride 🚀 🌕

115,GME,l9o3vs,2021-01-31 23:43:34,"You are being played: Citadel and Point72--major hedge funds and investors in Melvin--own tons of AMC, NOK, and BB. The only squeeze that hurts them is GME 🚀","***Edit as of May 27th, 2021***: I posted this back in something like January of this year. Stop commenting on it. Of course things have changed since then. But the price action you saw in AMC today was not shorts covering, it was options driven. Take a look at call volume today. 






The punchline: Citadel and Point72 own shit tons of AMC, BB, and NOK, and presumably want them to increase.

&#x200B;

I've found it somewhat suspicious that most accounts saying to buy/hold AMC, NOK, and to a degree BB are new. In addition, when each of these stocks started getting promoted here, other than GME (which was pretty much all that was talked about at the time) we were still almost exclusively an options subreddit. It took forever for most of us retards to learn that shares were important for GME as a special case, but all of the support for AMC, NOK, and to a degree BB was/is about holding shares, which was grounds to get booted to r/investing prior to GME. We're wallstreet*bets* after all. We trade high-risk options and share in our love of excruciatingly erotic loss porn. The people promoting AMC, NOK, and BB didn't/don't seem to fit in with their recommendations of shares. So I decided to look into this more.

&#x200B;

After being reminded by Cramer's video that hedge funds will often manipulate sentiment premarket by pushing the stock up and then slowly dumping it, I decided to look into a premarket comparison of GME and AMC on a random recent day. As you can see below, GME and AMC are both pumped up premarket, but by open GME has been shorted down (and it pops up) whereas AMC is in the stratosphere and falls sharply once everyone in the market is trading freely:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zgykmt8mqqe61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=eeae992d385ba8529a99e2558b270146099f7646

This seems like they may be trying to manipulate GME and AMC in opposite ways. This premarket activity can make people pile into non-GME stocks if it looks like GME peaked and others haven't. I haven't looked at BB or NOK, but my guess is that we'd see a similar divergence between GME and those stocks in after hours/premarket as well. 

&#x200B;

Most importantly, Citadel and Point72 are long on BB, AMC, and NOK. 

# BB

[According to 13F filings](https://fintel.io/so/us/bb), Citadel owns a whopping 1,068,700 shares of BB, and Point72 owns 519,200 shares. No options are owned by either fund. Point72 and Citadel clearly profit from BB's rise.

# AMC

[According to 13F filings](https://fintel.io/so/us/amc) (Ctrl+F citadel or point72), Citadel owns 292,926 shares of, call options on, and put options on AMC, and Point72 owns 21,758 shares. It's not possible to know what options strategy (e.g., long straddle) Citadel has in play, but it's clear Point72 and Citadel have both benefited from AMC's enormous increase. 

# NOK

[According to 13F filings](https://fintel.io/so/us/nok), Citadel owns an enormous 2,950,823 shares of, call options on, and put options on NOK, and Point72 does not own shares of NOK. It's not possible to know what options strategy (e.g., long straddle) Citadel has in play, but it's clear Citadel has benefited from NOK's rise.

&#x200B;

We already learned this morning that Citadel owns a humongous stake in silver, so that is most likely being shilled too. Importantly, if any of these funds sell off AMC, BB, NOK, or silver during their increase, they all have more capital to short GME with.

***The only stock increase that really hurts either of these funds or Melvin is GME*****.** *These funds shorted a viable and successful company to 140%. I know I would prefer to specifically focus on hedge funds that seem to have knowingly engaged in illegal naked shorting (Melvin, probably), appear to have forced Robinhood to stop allowing purchase orders (Citadel, Robinhood's primary financer), or are literally run by people who have been convicted of securities fraud (Point72).*

&#x200B;

# Why did AMC, BB, or NOK get restricted too, then?

The question remains as to why all of these stocks were restricted by many brokers at around the same time as GME. My belief is that purchases on these stocks were restricted in order to make them look like they were stocks that these hedge funds didn't want us to buy. Alternatively, *some* hedge funds are short these other stocks, so it's possible that they were having liquidity issues that also affected the market. But, like I mentioned above, I'd prefer to focus on hurting hedge funds engaging in illegal activities.

&#x200B;

**TLDR:** hedge funds profit off of your buying AMC, BB, and NOK calls/shares. These stocks seem to be shilled on here as alternatives to GME to distract us. Unless you want to line the pockets of Citadel, Point72, and indirectly Melvin, stay away from AMC, BB, and NOK. **BUY AND HOLD GME IF YOU WANT TO REALLY HURT THESE ASSHOLES. GME TO THE MOON 🚀🚀🚀🚀**

I couldn't really recommend GME to my non investing friends because at 2-300 it was overvalued. But at 90? You best believe I'm getting all the homies into the game now. Because GME could be a growth / value play at these prices. Albeit a growth/value play with a hefty premium. But I don't think my friends will mind. They like watching you squirm just as much as I do!

You hedgies should do your research before spamming the subreddit with bots and getting your shills in the media to bash the members of this community. Do you know who we are? Do you know what we do? I've been on this sub for the better part of a decade now. Our investment tool of choice is 0DTE options! We eat volatility for breakfast and shit it out by noon. We YOLO into far riskier bets than this.

In my tenure as a proud Theta Gang ambassador I've seen many a millionaire minted in these hallowed halls of ours. I've seen people iron hand (the OG 💎🙌) calls during the Coronavirus crash, and puts during the coronavirus recovery. We have a risk tolerance your puny manipulative brains couldn't even fucking comprehend.

I've seen the lads here make and lose money at rates I didn't even think were possible before joining this sub. (Shout out to u/1R0NYMAN ) You hedgies think you're hot shit because you went to an elitist school and have a lot of capital backing you up. Well I'm here to tell you, the only thing more dangerous than an enemy with unlimited resources is an enemy with nothing to lose. WSB is about the risky bets that either win big or lose big. That's what we're fucking all about. At 3-400 per share you had us in our comfort zone. At 90 per share you're basically begging us to fuck you.

It costs us exactly … (the Square Root of Jack fucking shit) to hold. It costs you millions to keep your retarded bets open. You guys are supposed to be the smartest guys in the room how'd you play into our hands so fucking easily? Like god damn this is some ""I'm going to dump my life savings into gourd futures"" levels of autism.

Like you retards realize that by executing short ladders we can just eat up liquidity even faster right?  By eating up liquidity the swings up and down will be even more massive. **Individual** investors are buying in from North America, from South America, from Europe, from Asia, from Africa!  Honestly it's just a matter of time until an arctic researcher drops a few bucks in to complete the set.

You tried to pull a fast one on us but ended up shooting yourselves in the leg to do so.

We'll outlast you.

This doesn't happen for weeks? No worries  
This doesn't happen for months? No fucking worries  
This doesn't happen for years? (Thanks for saving us a bunch on taxes!) Again **NO FUCKING WORRIES**

We've cornered you. It's buy or die. (Buy *and* Die for some of you retarded fucks lmfao) Buy our shares or die to fees and your clients leaving.

The first one of you hedgie fucks that closes out your short position is going to close for the least amount of money. There are bag holders even on Wall Street. WSB is a ""community"", can you really say the same for your wall street buddies? Sure they'll help out in a pinch but they'll leave you out to dry in a heartbeat if it no longer becomes worth it. There's a reason they say ""*There are no friends on Wall Street*"".

Thanks for the free money. I'll be buying more shares (5 figures worth) when Schwab clears my deposit.

149,BB,l94t1a,2021-01-31 05:46:24,"$NOK is almost certainly a plant. $GME is the most mechanically likely to squeeze, followed by $AMC and $BB","Sup retards, I rejoined to try and warn you all of the market crash last week thursday, and none of my posts and comments got through, not sure if this will either. 

I'll keep it short and sweet. $NOK is almost certainly a fucking plant, meant to bait you all into buying.

- High float, low price, perfect for retail to pile into
- It's not shorted much at all
- People only started mentioning it *very* recently last week. Out of the non-GME recent meme stocks ($AMC, $BB, $NOK), it's the most recent.
- Retail has gotten fucked on $NOK in the past
- The 5G thesis is great, but it's old fucking news

But OK, all the stuff above is more or less conjecture, let's assume I'm 100% wrong as an unreformed 🌈🐻 (still think that market crash is coming BTW), here's some signal [take another look at the stocks that Robinhood has restricted and how severe the restriction is](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-due-to-recent-market-volatility/) (as of 1/30):

| Symbol | Allowed Share purchases | Allowed Option Purchases |
|---|----|---|
| $GME | 1 | 5 (minimum of any of them) |
| $AMC | 1 | 10 |
| $BB | 1 | 10 | 
| $NOK | 5 | 10 | 

Which one of these is not like the other? $NOK is basically the least restricted (on both dimensions). I'm personally not super convinced on $BB either but meh.

Just like most other posts on WSB, this is not financial advice. Make your own investment decisions and know when to sell, because when the squeeze ends it will end fast -- make sure you and your friends talk about and exit strategy, we want to sell into Melvin, Citadel, and their friends, not each other. Once liquidity hits zero it would be great if someone started a count of how many shares were bought at the elevated prices.

I will echo something I read in another post here -- for all the 4MM new people here, **WSB LOSES MONEY ON AVERAGE**. We post and celebrate loss porn. $GME is the only safe bet right now, it will be green even in a sea of red because what's happening right now is mechanical, assured. The shorts have not completely covered yet, and they will. It's not about fundamentals, it's not about technicals, it is market mechanics.

[EDIT] People in the comments suggesting I haven't been on this sub long enough to understand why each individual stock is squeezing. Let me lay it out (please let me know if I'm wrong) so people stop suggesting that

- $GME rocketed because short squeeze + gamma squeeze
- $AMC rocketed because short squeeze + gamma squeeze + recent 900M cash infusion, Bankruptcy is 100% off the table
- $BB rocketed because of optimism around security, lack of compromise in Solarwinds
- $NOK rocketed because 5G, and some idea of being under valued (this one I admit I don't understand)

Shut the fuck up about it. If you know the above this post isn't for you.

This post exists to *dispel the fiction that half of these are legitimate short and/or gamma squeezes*. If you thought that $BB and $NOK were short squeezes, YOU ARE WRONG. They *MIGHT* gamma squeeze but certainly not with the restrictions on them.

[EDIT 2] It looks like people are still confused about brokers. There are three brokers that I can recommend, if you're trying to express a view on this market:

- Fidelity
- Vanguard
- TD Ameritrade ([see their restrictions](https://www.tdameritrade.com/td-ameritrade-trading-restrictions-stocks.page))

If you're thinking ""You're a fucking plant, how could you recommend TD Ameritrade?"", calm your tits. I have been posting since last week about the *actual* restrictions that are in on TD Ameritrade, fucking read them -- **you *CAN* buy $GME and $GME calls on TD**. The media misreported and never actually listed what the restrictions were for TD (they were one of the first to restrict).

NOTE: I DO NOT KNOW IF TD WILL CHANGE IN THE FUTURE, SO THE SAFEST ARE FIDELITY AND VANGUARD.

Also, I will shill for TD a bit -- when I dumped RH last year because they cost me money, I moved to TD and they forced me to do their education stuff on options and shares and futures before being approved for level 2 options (I'm not a fan of lying on my applications to financial institutions). I actually really fucking enjoyed it and learned a lot. I don't know how they're going to change since they merged with Chuck Schwab, and you could say that all their ""education"" schtick is actually just bullshit to convince you that you know what you're doing *before* you give the big boys your money, but I really like TD.

See my previous comments about TD's actual restrictions from when I called them, on the phone, like a boomer:

Okay GME gang. We’ve got the shorts on the ropes. They’re bleeding hard and all the billionaire suits are shitting themselves out of fear. They’ve tried false information, getting on CNBC and screaming for regulation of our “market manipulation,” trying to get us shut down, Biden administration tweet, saying shorts have already covered, etc. None of it has worked so far and they’re still bleeding money.

Now they’re truly desperate. What’s something they haven’t tried quite yet but very well could be setting up to do?

MARKET CRASH

Yes, that’s right. I believe with what I’m currently seeing, they are going to crash the market and blame it on us. Do I think you need to be concerned about GME? No, because holding it should still work and they still have to cover anyway, but this is definitely to try to get you scared and sell GME and so they can take your money back when you reinvest elsewhere.

I don’t think I have to tell many of you that the current levels are at/above where the market was valued in 2008 before the crash according to the Buffet indicator. All this says is that we’re probably in a market bubble, and it’s been at these levels for months now. But guess what just started getting talked about by all the suits? That’s right. A bubble. And who are they blaming? Us.

Now that I have your attention, let’s look at a few other things.

[This is the Volatility Index the past week.](https://imgur.com/gallery/C9ETmMR) Notice how it’s been steadily rising and suddenly spiked today? 40 is typically the resistance before the market makes a downturn. If this thing gets above that we’ll probably be seeing the market dropping quickly.

Additionally, there the spurts of high volume absolutely dumping stocks for short amounts of time. That’s one of the first things I noticed before the March crash and I’ve been seeing it get more and more abundant the last few weeks and picking up a lot today. [Notice the large red volume candles on the weekly SPY chart.](https://imgur.com/a/w0y33Lq) (Robinhood screenshot on a DD post??? Yes, I know. I’m on my phone with limited time. Deal with it lol.)

Now you might say, “it’s earnings season and there have been some bad earnings so far and that’s expected in this tough time.” Well yes, but there’s the Apple earnings today. They beat earnings pretty nicely and what did the stock do? [You guessed it (I hope).](https://imgur.com/a/Txc7po6)

Currently we’re seeing fundamentally strong companies as well as the S&P 500 beginning to drop and the volatility increase market wide. You could say this is “smart money” pulling out because they see the overvalued stocks. However, there were many worldwide financial issues sparking before the March crash. It just needed a catalyst, AKA global pandemic. Now we’re in a similar boat. Market issues in need of a catalyst.

What is that catalyst this time around? That’s right. A bunch of “millennials on a message board who have no place in stocks creating a market bubble.” Basically this isn’t smart money pulling out here. It’s MAD MONEY (hi Cramer). They are declaring WAR. They are pissed that we are “stealing” their billions on billions of dollars from them and they will do whatever it takes to get you to sell and take your money away from you again, including wrecking the market and the economy once again. The suits are out for blood now.

Do I think this will effect GME much? Only if you don’t sell. All this is scare tactics and ways to win your money back if keeping GME suppressed fails even more than it already has. There are hardly any shares to short if any at all and retail investors and autists are likely the ones holding most of the shares that could be sold.

Be careful out there autists

TLDR: GME TO VALHALLA. Rest of the market, potentially to the depths of Avernus soon.

Most of the takes on Robinhood are wrong. It’s a traffic jam. The same guard rails that are supposed to protect the plumbing of the system in an off ramp on the left side of the chart are slowing the system in the on ramp on the right side of the chart. You just can't open up millions of margin accounts a day trading stocks that move 300% a day. Even the most liquid brokerage quickly becomes very illiquid holding all the liable accounts. By Tuesday they will have enough liquidity and shares will have settled and retail will be able to buy en masse. Robinhood is the #1 app in the WORLD right now. This is only going to accelerate. They will get the plumbing right and add lines of credit. Credit markets are fine, so Robinhood can access capital. To the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀 

In addition, all the folks transferring accounts OUT of Robinhood cannot sell. It can take 3-5 days for a journal to clear. That is forced 💎🙌, which reduces the tradeable float of GameStop, increasing the short interest as a percentage of the float.

# THEY CALL IT GOD'S GREEN EARTH BECAUSE BY THE END OF THE SQUEEZE YOUR BROKER WILL BE SO FUCKING BRIGHT GREEN SUPERMAN WILL HAVE KYRPTONITE PTSD

My fellow GME brotheren. Friday is the night (or day). Tomorrow we head for our mission to finally get the money we deesrve. Unlike most of you (wether fortunately or unfortunately) I've been bagholding GME since 10. I saw myself through multiple ups and downs. I have gone through around 4(four) low, low, low -30% swings (the fourth being today's). If tomorrow goes well, the shorts will have such a ridiculous demand coming from the suspension of GME in brokerages, demands of the r/wallstreetbets brotheren, and Elon Musk, Chamath, and A-O-FUCKING C will skyrocket our diamond hands.

&#x200B;

Last time there was a ""dOnT gIve mE awArds"" post it got $18,000 worth of reddit awards. If you woudl have spent that on long dated, april calls (aka when GME was around 17) you would have broken 6 figures and would probably be in Millionaire status. **GME is our stimulus.** Those fat ass republican (& Democrat) motherfuckers didn't want us to give $1200 checks so we're taking $10,000 instead.

[🚀🚀🚀](https://preview.redd.it/didzepevr6e61.jpg?width=1214&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f349bd1c568c33b4d8ccbcac49e829d36dc5baf7)

The institutions have always made fun of us, they thought we were just a trend in the stock market that would come and go. THEY thought they could get away with breaking families in 2008 while earning just enough money to get another Yacht, this time gold-plated. NOW this is a movement. While unfortunately this wouldn't make these zillionaires broke, these motherfuckers are going to take us seriously. This wont be a cat and mouse game anymore, this will be an elephant seal vs elephant seal $GME now.

&#x200B;

Our lord DFV was just a regular value investor before he started to dive deep in GME. Loving person with a wonderful family. Now he is breaking an 8 figure net worth after being told off on his YOLO ""You're not gonna make it"" they said. If GME goes to $1000 (Which could be a possibility) this motherfucker will be 9 figures and I would never be more happy. He got me into GME first, shortly after Ryan and his goon squad arrived.

&#x200B;

So tomorrow, open your parachutes. Be ready for shorts trying to attack, and high volatility if that's the case. If the squeeze does not happen by tomorrow, worry not my fellow GME bretheren. Just DIAMOND HAND and HOLD until we get to our promised land. I wont argue if we can also tank to $0, but remember, it's not just for the money. It's for the message.

202,BB,lb56dt,2021-02-02 21:12:58,Some more DD for your BB (part 2),"Good 'whatever time of day it is for you' Autists,

As a follow-up to my post yesterday about BB, I wanted to attempt to place some of your worries at ease as many of you may be having second thoughts about your investments.  A link to my post yesterday will be provided at the end.

Yes, BB is dipping . However, please keep in mind that it is not dipping as hard as GME or AMC. There are reasons for this. BB had growth potential based on recent changes and it was never meant to be part of the current madness because the short interest just wasn't there compared to others.

It is apparent that of the BANG gang, AMC and GME got more media coverage than the rest despite having \*relatively\* less news than BB.  Referring to the premise of my DD yesterday, BB is a value play and NOT a get rich quick or anything play of the sort. This is a company that is reinventing their place in the corporate world, moving from phones to software development.  My smooth brain is holding on, even if it goes back to $7 because I believe in this company to reach new highs within the next year. 

If you invested yesterday after reading about how great I said BB is, I am sorry you can't buy a new Rolex today and you will need to go to Popeyes for your chicken tendies. However, that post was not meant to imply you would be posting gains porn by the end of the week. 

What we are seeing is likely a combination of paper hands getting scared of the pullback, and a correction in the stock after an unsustainable momentous gain based on the present value of the company. As they grow into their new position and make more and more deals to get their technology in everything, the stock will likely raise with it. When will this happen? Impossible to say, but the future looks bright. 

Before the recent momentum, BB was trading around $7.43. Even after the last few red days, BB is still holding over $11.50. Sure, this isn't as great as >$25, but like other stocks that go parabolic, there is an inevitable pull back. 

TL;DR - Stop being mad at your BB losses. Paper hands are for the weak. 

(Not financial advice, I am just a regular dude)

Prior BB post -  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lacbau/some\_dd\_for\_your\_bb/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lacbau/some_dd_for_your_bb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

When a stock has been on this list for 13 consecutive settlement days, brokers can be forced to cover open shorts by buying the missing shares. GME has been on the list since January 19. The 13th consecutive day for GME would be Thursday, February  4. That means naked short positions could start being forced to buy and close positions on Friday.

ORTEX showed a 6mil decrease in estimated SI from 72mil on 26th Jan to 66 mil on 27th Jan.

Thx to that guy who said that we can bypass paywall with incognito.

This gave us over 100% (150 per share) in gains. (Using after hours close to be conversative)

To hit 1k, assuming linear increase of share price to decrease in short interest, we only need 30mil shares to be covered, less than half of the current estimated short interest.

If we go by percentage increase, we barely need 15mil shares covered to blow past 1k (230% increase)

Here's the kicker, this shit isn't linear.

On the side of the prolapsed buttholes, panic increases as the price increases, even if the shorts try to diamond hand, they will get margin called.

On the side of us rocket bois, paper hands get shaken off and only the true diamond hands will remain, representing increased reluctance to part with shares.

In brief, the original demand supply problem now has increasing demand and decreasing supply.

Political

You hear the big fucks coming in talking about SEC investigation, stopping GME from trading and what not.

We already have DD on why there is nothing illegal happening here but I present the human angle.

Before anything, politicians need our vote. It is our vote that allows them to be in power to pull off whatever corrupt fuck.

The optics are already looking like the oppressed little guy fighting back against the big fuck face. The People against Evil Melvin.

Tendies don't have a party. This sub doesn't have a party. Right now we don't care who the autist next to us votes for, all we know is GME gang gang will tear 🌈🐻 a new one and we'll be rich and celebrate together from doing so.

Other than a few dumb idiots, no politician worth their salt would publicly do anything to stop GME. The backlash from the public would be MASSIVE.

We are in the right here. Melvin and co. can whine about it but any intervention on GME will be seen as foul play. Good luck getting a single vote out of any GME holder if they try fucking with us.

Positions, 200 GME shares @ 34.95

Edit: Msg from u/GMEsquoze who cant post. Dude has GME positions so

PT calculation for GME

All 3 are from premarket from a 3 minute candle setup. Times for each candle are 9:15, 9:18, 9:27. Why these candles? They are completely green with no wicks.

9:15 Low 248 High 268 Volume 336k Price Range is 20$ 1$ per 16.8k Volume

9:18 Low 267.77 High 327 Volume 948k Price Range is 60$ 1$ per 15.8k Volume

9:27 Low 324 High 354.8 Volume 564k Price Range is 30$ 1$ per 18.8k Volume

My reasons for using these candles is because there was no resistance on em when I was watching, they just went up indicating institutional buying. Assuming I am correct we have 1$ move per average 17.13k Volume. We have ~70M shares shorted on GME, which accounts to ~4k$ price move. We are currently trading at 330$. If they outright cover all the shares, which they won't we will arrive at a PT of 4.3k$ for 0 Short Interest on GME. This PT also doesn't include the gamma squeezes from MM, and the bullish buying from investors. So I would say the most conservative PT for GME would be the most unlikely scenario which is 4.3k$ if the shorts just cover the entire SI. Otherwise this can keep going higher for completely different reasons as I mentioned.

And now we're here.

It seems that people are blind as a rock when they see DFV's daily GME Yolo Updates.

Do you bother fucking reading anything? Ever? I mean, I get it, I write walls of text... but DFV uploads a single picture and you can't even bother reading that picture... Come on, that's prime savant! You literally cannot be helped if you're one of these people.

Here's what I mean,

[This is one of the first few posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d31bke/gme_yolo_update_following_the_q2_earnings_report/) by DFV uploaded on Sep 11, 2019.

All other things ignored, do you notice something? **Look at the ""CASH"" pile. It reads: $13,962.21**

Great, remember that fucking number because we're going to progress through this fiasco of ""he hasn't sold"".

I'm not gonna bother with a daily, or monthly reminder of how great DFV is at risk management. So let's skip a few months and head straight to [December 17 2020, here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kf69j1/gme_yolo_update_dec_17_2020/).

Notice something odd? Something remarkable? **The cash pile reads $1,105,069.48.**

Alright, maybe he just added a million more to his account by taking a HELOC against his rented house (how's that possible, I don't fucking know, anything's possible on wsb). But let's extend the usual WSB benefit of the doubt to DFV, because that's the least we can do. We're going to ignore the voice of reason and just say the dude took out 1mill against his mortgage to blow on GME YOLOs.

Cool, let's move on.

Total $3.6m - Cash pile on [Dec 25, 2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kk0g0f/gme_yolo_christmas_update_dec_25_2020/): $1,116,831.85

Total $5.78m - Cash pile on [Jan 13, 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwpviw/gme_yolo_update_jan_13_2021/): $1,128,842.20

Total $22.845m - Cash pile on [Jan 26, 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5nphz/gme_yolo_update_jan_26_2021/): $4,840,638.95

Total $22.171m - Cash pile on [Feb 02, 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb6jld/gme_yolo_update_feb_2_2021/): $13,817,567.62

Do you notice a trend, you smooth-brained jizz rocket? I really hope you do.

DFV, time and time again has proven to be a great investor. How could he not be, he hunts VALUE stocks, not YOLOs. His thesis on GME wasn't driven by a squeeze, but rather a company that was being sold on the market for cheaper than it was worth. Watch his videos, and you'll find that.

He just truly stuck by his thesis and the squeeze was the cherry on top of the cake... and while you idiots keep thinking he's not selling because all you read is the ""Total pile"", you're failing to realize he probably has brilliant stop losses that have taken his $50k to nearly $14m already. And as always, he's letting the rest ride. This is called... letting the winners ride.

You'll also notice his rolling of the options, and I don't know if they are strategic, but they are brilliant. Another indicator of him not being smooth brained.

Now, read his future daily updates carefully. I'm out.

**TLDR:** You're a savant, you don't need a TLDR... but I'll try. DFV has cashed out $14m worth of gains, and the top comment is always ""If he's still in, I'm still in"". In reality, DFV has fucked the game on so many levels, the game now calls him daddy. Rightfully so.

It is not a phone company. It is not telling you to use BBM. It is a software, automotive, and cybersecurity company that is about to make a killing. Let’s begin:

BB stock price, 6.71 as of Close on 1-6-2021. 

Technically, this thing is a fucking beauty. MACD flip, Stoch RSI cross, volume died on the sells and the thing is pushing up just the market died twice while it had solid momentum. This is going to move soon, but let's go away from crayons and into the magical land of make believe: news events, conferences, and fundamentals. It's not just two letters, it's a business. https://www.tradingview.com/x/uI3Cl51F/ 

**Recent Earnings**

Fiscal Quarter End| Date Reported| Earnings Per Share* | Consensus EPS* Forecast| % Surprise
---|---|----|----|----
Nov 2020| 12/17/2020| 0.1 | -0.04| 100

Feb 2020| 03/31/2020| 0.06| 0.01| 500



Surprises along the board.

* Revenues last quarter, $224 MM.
* Revenues projected for Q4, $246 MM.
* Full year Guidance 2021, $950 MM. 
* Mkt cap, $4 B. 
Total company non-GAAP revenue of $224 million; total company GAAP revenue of $218 million. Non-GAAP earnings per basic and diluted share of $0.02; GAAP loss per basic and diluted share of $0.23. Net cash generated from operating activities of $29 million.



Saw this cute image of CRWD PLTR and SNOW, all with similar or lower Revs but SNOW is half but worth 20x BB, CRWD has less revs but is operating at 11.75x, PLTR (WSB fav) has 50M more projected annual revs and is worth 11x. Alright who cares about revenue, that's only today. If only it accounted for the big event happening in the next 9 days (see news events below).

**NEWS EVENTS**

*FB settlement*

I’m not going to go into deep detail here as it is quite intricate and all I know is that BB won a suit against fuckerberg $FB related to messaging, whatsapp, and something else. $FB has till January 15th, 2020 to settle, see here: https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.331602/gov.uscourts.cand.331602.144.0.pdf 

This FB settlement is not included in earnings expectations, meaning THAT SHIT GOES UP or will be in analyst projections.

*BlackBerry IVY - Intellectual Vehicle Data Platform*

The big kahuna that will change BB for the next few years. Per BB website: “BlackBerry and AWS are joining forces to develop BlackBerry IVY, a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences and improve operations of connected vehicles with new BlackBerry QNX and AWS technology.”

What does it mean to the end consumer (the automakers?)

**IVY Fueling Business Outcomes**

BlackBerry IVY will help automakers and automotive suppliers:

Fuel Innovation by supporting rapid development of new customer experiences
Drive Revenue by unlocking new revenue streams and business models
Reduce Costs by moving processing to the edge & reducing raw data transmission
Improve Operations with enhanced data visibility and access
Expand Ecosystems by unlocking the broader app developer community

**Partnerships with big companies**

Blackberry partnered with Zoom (link: https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/10/blackberry-and-zoom-together-secure-your-virtual-enterprise-meetings), Microsoft Teams (link: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-athoc-integrates-with-microsoft-teams-for-critical-event-management-301147559.html) and some other company that I forgot. Cybersecurity adding onto big big platforms that exploded this past year. MORE MONEY you dumbasses.

Patents
BB started offloading old patents but have one that will be important as of recent, with the sexiest one being this: https://uspto.report/patent/grant/10880812 

Very pretty stuff, big sex.


**Business Implications**

BB makes their money from licensing, cybersecurity (one of the only companies that have not been hacked in this SolarWind shit), BB QNX is already in 175 MM cars worldwide, partnered with XPEV, and is in talks with multiple Tier 1 automakers, 20 different OEMs, and will be in vehicles by 2023. Does that mean anything now? Yes, you dumbass. Per CEO John Chen, my new president, #DidYouKnow @BlackBerry has been selected by 19 of the top 25 #ElectricVehicle manufacturers, and they represent 61% of the Electric Vehicle market?

Bubblicious and sexy. Expect some of the big tier 1s like Nissan, Toyota, BMW, and others to jump on this train. Think TSLA doesn’t have competition? Bitch they cant even make a billion dollars unless they sell stock (which since MS just upgraded their price, I bet they offer at least $5B in stock in the coming days).

**CONFERENCES**  

BB is speaking at the following conferences:

Citi’s 2021 Global TMT West Virtual Conference - Thursday January 7th, 2021 at 1 PM with the Steve Rai, Blackberry CFO  and John Wall, Co-Head of BlackBerry Technology Solutions (BTS) 

JP Morgan 19th Annual Tech / Auto Forum
Tuesday January 12th, 2021 at 5:45 PM ET

Needham’s 23rd Annual Virtual Growth Conference 
Friday, January 15th, 2021 at 1:15 pm ET 
With Ryan Permeh, Blackberry Chief Security Architect & Co-founder of Cylance and Eric Cornelius, Blackberry Chief Product Architect 

This was just announced and you bet your ass this will pump this stock up.



**Conclusion:**

This stock will generate a lot more cash in the coming years, will gain in the short term by offloading old patents, settling with FB and getting some moolah, growing in their partnership with Bezos gang, roll out to more EVs with Tier 1 and Tier 2 automotive companies, and compete with Tesla on this as well. This shit trades at $6.70 and is so close to going up if the market just doesn’t crash in the interim. They already are used by big companies for Access and other Mobile applications, so that someone can securely use their dinky iPhone to work. Think big whales aren’t interested? Look at 2022 2023 option OI. 

I think this goes to lower PT of $10 by May, more likely $15. uThInKitWiLLdOUbleINmKTcAp???? Yes you fucking idiot, this is trading at 4X sales only, will be profitable this year, and has so much shit coming up. This is UNDER 4B!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just buy the stock and sit on it. Want options? Buy them too. Have fun guys, I hope you all make money.

282,GME,lay5wi,2021-02-02 16:28:00,GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next,"Hello all,

(written Monday so ""tomorrow"" = Tuesday 2nd"")

If you don't recognize my name then perhaps you haven't seen my posts at the start of all this. You can find the original DD [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k688qv/for_those_who_dont_understand_the_inevitable/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and the pre-earnings assumptions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3p4bc/when_will_the_gme_squeeze_happen_answers_here/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

Things looked bad today, and truthfully I'm surprised and proud that it took this long for us to have a red day. At one point last week the stock plummeted to $120 and everyone seemingly forgets that detail simply because it quickly rebounded. It dropped all the way down nonetheless when trading restrictions were imposed.

Now, let's talk about that day. Why did it go down? That is easy, insane trading restrictions especially on RH where the majority shareholders place trades.

But what's interesting to examine is...why did it go back up? My thesis is this was, in fact, Melvin covering. Retail investors were completely locked out of trade yet the price skyrocketed.

Melvin is not the only short in the game, in fact many new short positions were opened. Some intentionally, others unintentionally due to lacking the funds required to cover the calls that were sold. Some people were selling calls with an $80 strike price others upwards of $400. Many of these calls were executed and people who never thought it would surpass $80 were now stuck holding the bag with a $320 strike price on Friday.

One of two things can happen to these people:

1. T+2, they will have two business days to cover their losses if able
2. If unable, they will have to open a short position to borrow the shares that they promised to cover.

This logic is what led to new short positions opening last week and certainly will mean more short positions opened this week.

So what happened today? Well, loads of people were still locked out of trading and a price drop happened. Naturally this was some longs taking profits but the volume is key here. The extremely low volume compared to the price drop simply doesn't add up. Instead it looks like a series of ladder attacks and ping ponging between hedge funds to drive the price down without any buyers to counter their progress.

Now, why would they do this? **This is a very interesting question.**

If shorts have covered, and there is no more fear of losses then why are they still trying to drive the price down, shift attention to Silver, and having the media run amuck with countless baseless claims?

Normally, I am a fan of logic and reasoning and like to break things down to multiple situations...but this one only has one answer: they haven't covered.

If they were covered and out of this, then all this other manipulation exists for no reason.

Another question to consider:

If shorts were covered or short interest was extremely low, then why is trading still restricted if there is no danger of a squeeze that would put brokers out of business? Again this has but one answer: there is still a danger for a massive short squeeze.

The final thing to consider, if people are willing and want to buy and hold a stock, its price should go up...right? Well, all of WSB and many retail investors are still adding on this dip.

Now, tomorrow will be an interesting day to monitor. If the price is maintained or lifted it will lead to another gamma squeeze due to all of the contracts that finished ITM on Friday. So all contracts that were sold to expire 1/29 with a strike price of $320 or lower will need to be covered by tomorrow. Technically T+2 is actually 2.5 so they might extend into Wednesday. A gamma squeeze will lead to the final short squeeze and in previous posts I would laugh at $1000 price target, but truthfully...I would now call that a minimum. Despite what today looked like, price decrease + low volume = bullish.

Now, there is always possibilities but luckily this is one we can control:

1. If the stock keeps getting purchased and held, then regardless of squeeze mechanics, the price will rise. With the squeeze, $1000 is a fair and minimum assumption.
2. If we cannot outlast the short attacks or trading gets restricted further (which at that point will have no merit), then GME will remain one of the most interesting stocks now that their are tons of longs on it and short int won't be immediately squeezed, it's interesting to consider a PT when the squeeze is complete.

**TL;DR:** If shorts truly covered and there is no more squeeze left, why is trading still restricted? What are they are afraid will happen? With millions of people still buying more, then this price has no reason to go down...yet it is. That is due to trading restrictions and hedge funds taking advantage of the fact that no one could trade. A ladder attack that can't be interfered with is a perfect attack. Volume has been far to low to justify price action or even half of shorts covering.

I am not a financial advisor, I'm just a guy that loves logic and reasoning.

**EDIT:** For people claiming the liquidity defense, please tell me why trading on TSLA was not blocked during its insane short squeeze. If that sounds aggressive I'm sorry, I'm truly trying to find an answer to this question.

TLDR: We are this way, because it's the only way we are allowed to be, as retail traders.

Now that that's out of the way, lets look at it from a normie traders point of view.

&#x200B;

1. **Pattern Day Trading:** Why does it exist? To protect us? From what? Do you ask for a W2 for everyone literally walking into a casino to see if they are capable of losing what they are risking? No, they are free to spend as they please. Funny, I thought that's what a free market was for too?
2. **Market Makers:** You want us to literally just stop, leave, and use a casino? Use DraftKings and that sort of platform, ok. Now what, how do you make your money off of ""dumb money"" when it's gone? You need us, we need you.
3. **\*WHY\* is a collective of people on Reddit such a danger?:** For the sake of arguing, before this happened, there were 800,000 of us just being collectively dumb together. LETS JUST SAY, combined, we had 1 billion dollars between 800,000 people. That's scary? You lost 2.7b in the first wave of short losses, then asked for help for another 3b. Do you know what that means? THAT MEANS, that hedge funds, as a collective, is the problem, NOT REDDIT.
4. **When we got together, it was a crime, when you got together, it was not a problem?** How can we be ""investors"" in a rigged game, literally, please explain it. We HAVE TO GAMBLE to make money, because those are YOUR RULES.
5. **Trading is passive income, not a job:** Yeah, it's a passive way to kill time for 95% of us, make a little side money, couple grand here or there, sometimes get lucky and make 10k. This is a lot for regular people, it's literally NOTHING to you, but debt payment and vacation funds for us.
6. **We are Degenerates and Dumb Money:** If a large group of dumb people cost you money is a problem...then why is a large group of smart people (you market makers and hedge funds) that manipulate costs to take dumb moneys money away, allowed?

Anyways, there is a list 3 miles long.

GameStop isn't about GameStop, it's a beacon of reason, it could have been any stock, Citron just picked the target and we used it.

Good Luck Diamond Handing gents. Think about it this way. No matter what happens, **THEY HAVE LOST MORE MONEY THIS MONTH**, than what average day traders have collectively made in 5 years. Let that sink in.

Edit: This blew up, appreciate all the support!

I recently saw this video, it's 10 minutes long, but the ***first 3 are incredibly important!***

We’re told to HOLD, so we HOLD but we don’t know how to read the market. Let’s clarify it in here if possible.","Like I said, many of us joined because we believe in the cause. We believe that the game has been played by the 1% and we want to do what we can to bring it down. Whether 1 share or 500, many of us non-investors are being told to hold because of (insert reason here). 

I think we’re doing a great job. All of us. 

Here is the issue that gets brought up in a lid of threads and often gets bypassed:

If the big deals are manipulating buys; if they’re paying penalties instead of closing their shorts; if they have the SEC in their pocket; if they’re manipulating the market.... if they’re inventing the rules as they go.... what’s not to say the rules get changed and they don’t have to pay up ever. Really, haven’t they shown us that they will go to all lengths to avoid paying up. Can’t they just screw us over forever?

303,DD,lb56dt,2021-02-02 21:12:58,Some more DD for your BB (part 2),"Good 'whatever time of day it is for you' Autists,

As a follow-up to my post yesterday about BB, I wanted to attempt to place some of your worries at ease as many of you may be having second thoughts about your investments.  A link to my post yesterday will be provided at the end.

Yes, BB is dipping . However, please keep in mind that it is not dipping as hard as GME or AMC. There are reasons for this. BB had growth potential based on recent changes and it was never meant to be part of the current madness because the short interest just wasn't there compared to others.

It is apparent that of the BANG gang, AMC and GME got more media coverage than the rest despite having \*relatively\* less news than BB.  Referring to the premise of my DD yesterday, BB is a value play and NOT a get rich quick or anything play of the sort. This is a company that is reinventing their place in the corporate world, moving from phones to software development.  My smooth brain is holding on, even if it goes back to $7 because I believe in this company to reach new highs within the next year. 

If you invested yesterday after reading about how great I said BB is, I am sorry you can't buy a new Rolex today and you will need to go to Popeyes for your chicken tendies. However, that post was not meant to imply you would be posting gains porn by the end of the week. 

What we are seeing is likely a combination of paper hands getting scared of the pullback, and a correction in the stock after an unsustainable momentous gain based on the present value of the company. As they grow into their new position and make more and more deals to get their technology in everything, the stock will likely raise with it. When will this happen? Impossible to say, but the future looks bright. 

Before the recent momentum, BB was trading around $7.43. Even after the last few red days, BB is still holding over $11.50. Sure, this isn't as great as >$25, but like other stocks that go parabolic, there is an inevitable pull back. 

TL;DR - Stop being mad at your BB losses. Paper hands are for the weak. 

(Not financial advice, I am just a regular dude)

313,AMC,l9zzek,2021-02-01 11:13:40,AMC and GME are following exact same patterns. Do not flinch.,"AMC and GME are experiencing the same bullish and bearish behaviours and thus experiencing some wild volatility. This is all because of the market makers so do not worry, as this is typical and was seen all last week. Even if more restrictions will hit just hold and we will bounce right back up if the consistency of the holders stay unchanged.

&#x200B;

AMC going from +20% to remaining unchanged at 0% whilst GME goes to almost +10% and then remaining unchanged premarket at the exact same time will be the norm the coming time.

&#x200B;

Best advice is: hold and buy more as this is just the same garbage as went on as a result of the big hedge funds getting hit in the end of last week. RobinHood are still the puppy of Citadel and will keep on making this as scary for new investors etc.

&#x200B;

And of course, I am only telling you this because I like this stonk :).

Edit: I am all in on GME shares holding from 130.

Edit 2: no need to message me. Not a financial advisor. If you are worrired about any of the stocks on here the best thing to do IMO is to hold.

Edit 3: this is a short ladder. Just buy up paper hands and hold forever.

Edit 4: Check out the frontpage. 

""If you see GME falling quickly without volume , this isn't actual selloff of GME shares but a tactic of hedge funds to scare you into selling GME. Read this thread if you want to know more about this. The order book is filled with round number orders like 100 and 200, which is Citadel and Melvin just fucking with us.

323,SLV,l8uu76,2021-01-30 21:25:46,The $GME squeeze will bring down Melvin. The Silver squeeze will bring down the biggest banks in the world. That's why Robinhood barred trading of $SLV the day after they took a billion dollars in loans from JPM and Goldman Sachs. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME.,"You retarted apes are growing up. I remember a year ago this sub was nothing but memes of J-Powell littered with rocketship emojis. Now It's GME posts littered rocketship emojis. We've come so far. 

Now listen:

If you think Wall Street is shitting their pants over the GME short squeeze you are 100% right. Jim Bianco lays out a [convincing case](https://www.financialsense.com/podcast/19847/jim-bianco-gamestop-and-great-short-seller-takedown#.YBTK3GAFZmU.twitter) that SPY was down 2% on Friday because hedge funds were dropping their ""safe"" stocks to raise capital for collateral against their rising margin debt on GME. 

But you also got to know this. At the same moment Robinhood halted purchases of GME, after calls from their hedge fund buddies, they also put on limits on $SLV. 

([Here is the list of all limited stocks](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-due-to-recent-market-volatility/) \- they've since added weird stuff like Starbucks, but $SLV was one of the first along with $GME and $AMC). I think that's pretty weird, considering that, unlike these other stocks, $SLV was up only a few percent on Thursday. It's even weirder when you consider that Robinhood had just been [bailed out by JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/robinhood-is-said-to-draw-on-credit-lines-from-banks-amid-tumult?sref=rY0z5sRB)! These fuckers are two of the worst silver manipulators out there. (Seriously. Link for [Goldman](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bank-nova-divestiture-goldman-sachs-idUSKBN1DS2C5). Link for [JPM](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/29/jp-morgan-settles-spoofing-lawsuit-alleging-fraud-in-metals-trades.html))

These banks have been raking it in on suppressing the price of silver for  decades. Look at this historical chart of silver. Does this make any sense? Silver was well over $30 for several years in the ***fucking 1980s.*** And now it's $27???

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8rf9ip323je61.png?width=1914&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8bfdbed2e78d08ef1d411241adc6d68141ede47

The fair price of silver, conservatively is CERTAINLY over $50, but it seems that there were some strings attached to JPM and GS's little loan to Robinhood. 

I'm balls deep in GME, but am riding this silver train too. Already last week $AG and $SLV were surging despite Robinhood's best efforts. If this thing breaks, both of those tickers will at least double. My personal price target for Silver is $70. The tendies from silver will be extra sweet for me  - nothing like breaking up the greatest cartel in modern history (apologies to OPEC). 

Keep fighting the good fight apes. We'll bring these bastards to their knees. 

My positions: $GME shares, $AG and $SLV shares and July calls.

TIME is the enemy of Wall Street. They’re running like a chicken with no head. They have to COVER and pay INTEREST!!

AS LONG AS YOU HOLD AND DONT SELL, those big dips are NOT REALIZED LOSSES! They’re just psychological losses to make you DOUBT AND SELL!

Brokers restricting PURCHASE of these stocks is creating an UNFAIR ratio of SUPPLY and due to the restriction of stock it creates a LOW DEMAND! Therefore when there’s a big supply and low demand is when the stock price goes down. However, there is A LOT OF DEMAND and that’s why they’re playing DIRTY and restricted purchase to CREATE A FAKE LOW DEMAND! That’s why there are lawsuits. 

1) HOLD AND BUY THE DIPS

2) DONT LET WALL STREET BULLY YOU

3) AS DAY PASSES WALL STREET CONTINUE TO BLEED since they have to cover and pay interest

4)HOLD AND BUY🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕

5)REMOVE YOUR STOP LOSSES❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️

6) SET LIMIT AS HIGH AS YIU CAN

7) DO NOT LOCK IN GAINS because you want to BUY DIPS. With the restriction, this strategy is not plausible

8) AMC/GME ruled out bankruptcy so your stock won’t be $0

9) DOUBLE CHECK any news or analyst or posts as they may try to scare you with fake facts. Do your own DD

10) think positive of the BIG REWARD. You CANT lose more than your total investment but  GAINS ARE LIMITLESS and this is what’s SCARING wallstreet.

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*.

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.

DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY.

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the **false expectation** of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. **DON'T BE THAT PERSON.**

343,NOK,l4x1yx,2021-01-25 21:43:34,$NOK Next stock to blow,"&lt;TL:DR at bottom if you can't read&gt;

This is why Nokia will boom in 2021. Like $BB, it is no longer a phone company, but is now a major contender in 5G, autonomous driving, AI tech and cyber security. In fact, it almost sounds like a better blackberry with more upside potential. $NOK is trading at $4.75 at the time of writing. It saw a steady decline since it's previous high of $5 in August of 2020, but has since recovered in the last 4 months. 

The reason for the initial selloff was a corporate decision to cut jobs to free up cashflow for large projects going forward. At this time they also halted dividends which pissed off some older retirees, as expected. Now here is the various reason this stock can deliver massive returns in the next 12-36 months.

**Selected for U.S. Federal 5G Security Project**

The project is to ensure a secure transition from 4G to 5G because of the various risks perceived by the general public, to whom security comes above all else. Nokia will provide both software and hardware solutions, and work with both NCCoE and Government to implement.

**Nokia wins Belgian 5G contracts as Huawei ousted**

To put it short, Nokia was chosen to implement 5G technology in Belgium as US continued to put pressure on literally everyone to end business with Huawei over potential security threats.

**5 Year Deal with T-Mobile**

T-Mobile will be using Nokia's Airscale Radio Platform to scale up 5G deployment. As well as this, Nokia will personally facilitate T-Mobiles upgrade from LTE to 5G, which is by all means a large project

**Partnership with Google Cloud**

Googles cloud computing services will be working together with Nokia to help businesses transform their network connectivity through the implementation of 5G and new cloud capabilities.

**Contract Secured with Tele2 in Sweden**

The amount has not been disclosed but it involves deploying 5G infrastructure for Tele2 subscribers in Sweden, to improve network performance and security. They will also use Nokia's NetAct Cloud Management system to improve management and security of sensitive subscriber data.

**Partnership with M1 to build Singapore 5G Ecosystem**

Together with M1, Nokia will implement their 5G standalone core to deliver advanced network capabilities to Singapore. The 5G Standalone core tech allows operators to design and automate network slices to further development of unmanned aerial or road vehicles, remote operations, wireless e-health, etc...

TL:DR

Nokia is not a phone Company. Major contender in the 5G space, cybersecurity AND AI autonomous vehicle operation. Partnerships with other large companies in both the US and abroad have set the stage for NOKIA to dominate 5G, which has the potential to see more growth than any other industry in 2021. Also have more upside potential as Huawei continues to lose contracts due to US pressure and potential security threats.

351,GME,l76f74,2021-01-28 20:39:31,This is why you should HOLD Shares and BUY more GME regardless of current price or volatility,"For those new comers who dont understand what is going on with Gamestop. As you can see there are 69.75M outstanding shares of which 46.89M shares are float (meaning they are available on the market to trade, other shares are held by the GME corp, CEO etc). The Shares (short) as of Jan 14 2021 shows  61.78M shares short. Meaning when there are only 46.89M shares available on the market, the shorted shares are more than the available ones. They need your shares to get out of their short positions. They have shorted more shares then the number of shares which exist. If you people HOLD or BUY more shares, the higher the value goes once the squeeze happens (When their short contracts expire, they would have to buy. If there are no shares to buy, the price goes to the Moon and beyond because of simple demand and supply. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Today was a ladder attack which showed very low volume when the stock was halted. It was there to scare off investors. Everyone should keep their shares held to themselves and buy more at any given price. May Gamestop be the most valuable company for a while on the squeeze just like Volkswagen did back in 2008.

&#x200B;

P.S ignore people who are buying BB, AMC, NOK because they think there may be a squeeze with those companies too or think they are too late to jump into GME squeeze. Remember, the squeeze will happen eventually. Volkswagen squeeze took almost 2 years, but GME will be wayyyy quicker because of the spread of the news and the sheer amount of people jumping in.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Buy GME in any way or HOLD it if you cant buy more.

&#x200B;

P.S: This is not financial advice. I LIKE THE STOCK THATS WHY I AM BUYING IT.

**The Shorts - The Side Show**

Let’s be honest, the real reason anyone is in WSB right now is to fist shorts. BCRX, however, is also a company that needs to gap up to reach fair value.  Fist the shorts and hold the gains.

Biocryst has a high and steadily growing institutional ownership [currently reported at 71%](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/bcrx/institutional-holdings). Biocryst has a float of 175m (124m of which are held by institutions), who are buying every share they can and not likely to sell any time soon.  This leaves 56m tradable shares. [The shorts have 30m shares or 70% of the tradable float.](http://nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=ShortInterest) This is not as big as the $GME naked short taken on by u/DeepFuckingValue. But, we think this is a stock that if it gaps up can hold the gain based on value. Institutions run an algorithm almost every day and short the stock (check the charts). We can make these fuckers squirm with the slightest effort.

HAE is a rare disease that affects roughly 1/50,000 people, or about \~25,000 people in the three regions mentioned previously.

Orladeyo treats a rare disease and that means the medication is expensive. It costs [$485,000/year in the US](https://endpts.com/biocryst-wins-approval-for-hae-pill-and-charges-half-a-million-dollars-but-will-anyone-take-it/#:~:text=Six%20years%20after%20the%20FDA,BioCryst%20has%20notched%20another%20approval.&text=Despite%20inferior%20efficacy%2C%20BioCryst%20will,had%20projected%20a%20%24300%2C000%20tag.) and will roughly cost half of that in Japan and the EU. The company has projected they will capture 40% of the market [(page 15)](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/bcd71bf3-ef71-4803-81c4-edd4e33ebb38).  Capturing 40% of the market is a share price of [$70 when trading at a reasonable (if not conservative) 7x revenue multiple.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tLvclUzTqCitwKfawL7kGCLquJxA2T7IJKLg52VWotE/edit?usp=sharing) Work your own numbers and you’ll find SP should be more than $9 and the current market cap of 1.6 billion. FDA approval of Orladeyo enabled BioCryst to cross a bridge from a small unprofitable research company to expanding [commercial biotech](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4393550-biocryst-time-to-switch-hats-mid-cap-fits-now-maybe-large-cap) now engaged in execution.

**Factor D -  The Main Event**

Factor D is the blockbuster.  Full stop.  The company is already pursuing PNH but has indicated their intended subsequent targets for this drug. They’re small targets like “Lupus” and “IGA Nephropathy” along with[ 6 others (page 24)](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/41ee0771-0acc-479e-a39e-2842101c6aa9) and it’s already being hailed as [“best in class”](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3087617&headline=BCRX-BioCryst-has-potential-bestinclass-PNH-treatment-says-JMP-Securities)

So what’s this look like money wise?  Alexion’s drugs SOLIRIS® and ULTOMIRIS® are the current treatment for PNH those [make up 4.3B of their 5B revenues.](https://ir.alexion.com/node/22191/pdf)  AstraZeneca just bought them out for a whopping 39B.  If Factor D receives same valuation, that alone puts SP at $222 given our float.  [The sky is truly the limit](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tLvclUzTqCitwKfawL7kGCLquJxA2T7IJKLg52VWotE/edit?usp=sharing) over the next 24-48 months.  The point is, the company is ready to gap up on merit, but is being held back by high short activity.

**Galidesivir - The Wild Card**

If you aren’t already excited, maybe you’ll be excited by a drug [that provides 90% protection against Ebola](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320203179_Efficacy_of_Galidesivir_against_Ebola_Virus_Disease_in_Rhesus_Monkeys) when dosed 72 hours post exposure. Huge Ebola outbreak? BioTerror attack in a major city?  Think humanity might end in a pandemic more lethal than covid with people hemorrhaging blood from their eyes? No problem. Just distribute the [galidesivir](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/galidesivir) and most everyone will be protected. (Animal studies suggest high protection against [Zika](https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/4/suppl_1/S55/4294108), Yellow Fever, Marburg, [Tick Borne Encephalitis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31142664/) and others). 

Why didn’t we already have this drug?  That’s anyone’s guess, but politics seems to have something to do with it.  No one can yet determine the value or ultimate use of galidesivir as it is tied up in government development contracts. The company has already [stated](https://ir.biocryst.com/events/event-details/biocryst-third-quarter-2020-conference-call) that it is developing galidesivir for government contracts and shareholders seem to have little to do with this. So, we’ll just call this the sleeping wild card.

**FOP- The Feel Good Drug**

This is not a money maker. But, in case you haven’t found a soft spot for this company, they appear close to a first time cure for an extremely rare disease called [FOP](https://www.biocryst.com/our-pipeline/fop-program/). It slowly (and painfully) cripples children when their joints fuse together with excess bone. Children affected by FOP often end up wheelchair bound by age 11. Can’t tell you this drug will be a money maker as the affected population is too small. But, gosh, don’t you want the company to succeed?

**The Competition - The Class Clowns**

Disease:  Hereditary Angioedema (HAE)

For the prophylactic (preventative) market, the competitors are Cinryze, Takhzyro (from Takeda) which are IVF and subcutaneous injections respectively. Haegarda (CSL Behring) has a subcutaneous injection as well. Orladeyo recently received [FDA approval](https://biopharmajournal.com/2020/12/07/biocryst-pharmaceuticals-inc-nasdaqbcrx-receives-fda-approval-for-orladeyo-in-preventing-hae-attacks/) to be the first and only oral prophylactic treatment for HAE.

The patents of the competitors expire in 2032 and no generics are expected on the market before 2032. Orladeyo was granted extended patent protection until [2037](https://ir.biocryst.com/news-releases/news-release-details/new-composition-matter-patent-allowance-extends-protection). [Royalty Pharma](https://www.royaltypharma.com/news-releases/news-release-details/royalty-pharma-acquires-royalty-interest-orladeyo-and-bcx9930) did a deep dive on BioCryst’s expected Orladeyo revenues when it agreed to royalty financing that enabled BCRX to fast track Factor D development and expand it to 8 clinical indications.  

Disease: Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) 

Alexion holds the sole drug Soliris and its spin off Ultomiris (both IVF C5 inhibitors) to treat the rare blood disorder PNH. Alexion has market exclusivity until 2025 for Soliris. [This activist letter ](http://www.elliottletters.com/alexion.pdf)and [this article](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/alexion-moves-from-cfo-clancy-and-his-legendary-caution-does-mean-more-m-a-coming) highlight that analysts believe the 39B purchase of Alexion was a fire sale due to mismanagement. If Factor D received at least the same discounted valuation as ALXN, that would mean its market cap would increase from 1.6B to 39B. Excited?

Factor D is expected not just to be equivalent to Soliris, but exceed it. BioCryst Medical Director Bill Sheridan believes Factor D will make competitors [“obsolete”](https://ir.biocryst.com/events/event-details/39th-annual-jp-morgan-healthcare-conference) as it cures patients earlier in the disease process than C5 and C3 inhibitors. Unlike competitors, Factor D will also be both an oral pill \*and\* a monotherapy. In other words, there’s not much competition. Also, PNH is only the first of 8 serious illnesses expected to be treated by Factor D.

**The Insiders**

Still not convinced? CFO Anthony Doyle joined BioCryst April 02, 2020. Four months after joining the company he used $220,320 of his own money to [purchase shares in BioCryst ATM.](https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1808688.htm) As he is mortal like the rest of us, we assume CFO Anthony Doyle also pays taxes. Therefore, it appears as if he put the entirety of his after tax salary, for a whole year, into aligning himself with shareholders. Famed biotech investor Alex Denner has also been accumulating a passive position, ATM, right next to retail, [as recently as a couple weeks ago](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-bcrx-biocryst-pharmaceuticals-sarissa-capital-management-lp-sc-13g-2021-january-25-18652).

**Too Many Good Things?**

BCRX researched small molecules and crystalline structures for years. If that’s opaque, the easier way to think of it is they first [developed](https://magazine.einsteinmed.org/enzymologist-extraordinaire/) an [engine](https://m.box.com/shared_item/https%3a%2f%2fmontefiore.ent.box.com%2fs%2fbdbl0u3qnbnp6id3nmo0n5ke8siudtp2) and are now in execution and placing the engine into cars. 

**No More Shareholder Dilutions**

If your interest is perking, you’ll be happy to hear CEO John Stonehouse [promised(listen to question and answer section)](https://ir.biocryst.com/events/event-details/39th-annual-jp-morgan-healthcare-conference) there will be no shareholder dilutions, as all company operations are funded into 2023. The company does not plan to revise guidance.

In my opinion, $BB got wrapped up in this $BANG phenomenon and is being attached to avoid any further losses by Big Money. There is so much good going for this company right now and $BB discussion has been relatively quiet. This dip is an absolute discount fire sale right now and although I am not a financial adviser and do not offer this as advice I am definitely thrilled about the buying opportunity and will definitely be capitalizing on it. Although I have been a member here for a short period and only trading for a few years now, I like to think I know a solid value play, especially in tech thanks to you smooth brains, when I see one. 1 - 3 years and this stock will make the difference between retiring comfortably on time and retiring early with excess spending money.

395,GME,l9ywyz,2021-02-01 09:58:35,Things to remember on Monday if you hold GME stock,"# Remember hedge funds have the weak hand

They had to realise gains from other investments just to cover losses from GME. Thursday and Friday were the days with the biggest deleveraging sisnce March 2020. Each day they have to pay high interest just to mantain the short positions, and you know what? Every time they realise gains to cover losses their performance gets worse, and this makes them look like idiots in front of their clients, putting their business in danger.

# Expect some crazy volatility

Remember you are playing against hedge funds, they are not going to give you free money. There is no free money in the stock market. GME investors hit them hardly, and for them is not just about losses but they have to proof to their clients that they cannot be beaten by a bunch of redditors. They may suppress the price or manipulate it. There are some excellent posts on this sub about how they manipulate the stock price (ladder attacks, MSM misinformation, etc).

# Manage your risk

I hold GME since $20s. For me right now there is no risk in holding the stock because it will never go back to that level. If you just bought at $300 have in mind they may be able to supress the price for days or weeks to $100-$200 level, so you must be able to stomach this volatility. I would recommend only investing money you can afford to lose to not panic sell if you see this wild volatily.

The important thing as an investor is to hold, more than to buy like crazy.

# Be a critical thinker, do your DD

There is nothing that the MSM wishes more than to see loss porn from retail investors to say ""see, they didn't know what they were doing"". Please, don't give them the opportunity to say that.

Do your DD, check user history whenever you read something to make sure users are no hedge fund trolls. Hedge funds are now trying to focus you attention on everything except GME. The Silver play is a trap. Citadel is long silver. 

# BEWARE THAT IF YOU BUY SILVER, you are helping Citadel to cover losses with their gains and give them the chance to fight on GME.

Maybe mods should ban silver posts as lots of people could potentially lose money on that play.

&#x200B;

TLDR:

DO YOUR OWN DD. BE CRITICAL.

HOLD. THEY HAVE THE WEAK HAND, NOT YOU.

BEWARE OF SILVER.

For SEC minions reading this: this is not investment advice.

Edit 1: many thanks for the awards guys.

Edit 2: WSJ and Bloomberg are pushing the silver narrative and creating the impression that somehow people here are coordinated which is complete false. Also Citadel is long silver and it seems posts are being created mainly by bots. I definitely think mods should take action.

Edit 3: about silver, it is not my call, I am just sharing my point of view, I totally get the people who says nothing should be banned. Just have in mind MSM are depicting WSB as a group of organized investors that are colluding to target different assets, which is completely false. Should their message gets acceptance because of SLV they could try to ban this sub. So I think mods should at least check if those posts are legit, and if they comply with the rules.

And now we're here.

It seems that people are blind as a rock when they see DFV's daily GME Yolo Updates.

Do you bother fucking reading anything? Ever? I mean, I get it, I write walls of text... but DFV uploads a single picture and you can't even bother reading that picture... Come on, that's prime savant! You literally cannot be helped if you're one of these people.

Here's what I mean,

[This is one of the first few posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d31bke/gme_yolo_update_following_the_q2_earnings_report/) by DFV uploaded on Sep 11, 2019.

All other things ignored, do you notice something? **Look at the ""CASH"" pile. It reads: $13,962.21**

Great, remember that fucking number because we're going to progress through this fiasco of ""he hasn't sold"".

I'm not gonna bother with a daily, or monthly reminder of how great DFV is at risk management. So let's skip a few months and head straight to [December 17 2020, here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kf69j1/gme_yolo_update_dec_17_2020/).

Notice something odd? Something remarkable? **The cash pile reads $1,105,069.48.**

Alright, maybe he just added a million more to his account by taking a HELOC against his rented house (how's that possible, I don't fucking know, anything's possible on wsb). But let's extend the usual WSB benefit of the doubt to DFV, because that's the least we can do. We're going to ignore the voice of reason and just say the dude took out 1mill against his mortgage to blow on GME YOLOs.

Cool, let's move on.

Total $3.6m - Cash pile on [Dec 25, 2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kk0g0f/gme_yolo_christmas_update_dec_25_2020/): $1,116,831.85

Total $5.78m - Cash pile on [Jan 13, 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwpviw/gme_yolo_update_jan_13_2021/): $1,128,842.20

Total $22.845m - Cash pile on [Jan 26, 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5nphz/gme_yolo_update_jan_26_2021/): $4,840,638.95

Total $22.171m - Cash pile on [Feb 02, 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb6jld/gme_yolo_update_feb_2_2021/): $13,817,567.62

Do you notice a trend, you smooth-brained jizz rocket? I really hope you do.

DFV, time and time again has proven to be a great investor. How could he not be, he hunts VALUE stocks, not YOLOs. His thesis on GME wasn't driven by a squeeze, but rather a company that was being sold on the market for cheaper than it was worth. Watch his videos, and you'll find that.

He just truly stuck by his thesis and the squeeze was the cherry on top of the cake... and while you idiots keep thinking he's not selling because all you read is the ""Total pile"", you're failing to realize he probably has brilliant stop losses that have taken his $50k to nearly $14m already. And as always, he's letting the rest ride. This is called... letting the winners ride.

You'll also notice his rolling of the options, and I don't know if they are strategic, but they are brilliant. Another indicator of him not being smooth brained.

Now, read his future daily updates carefully. I'm out.

**TLDR:** You're a savant, you don't need a TLDR... but I'll try. DFV has cashed out $14m worth of gains, and the top comment is always ""If he's still in, I'm still in"". In reality, DFV has fucked the game on so many levels, the game now calls him daddy. Rightfully so.

# My Problem:

Like most of you retards, I need my financial biases pre-digested so it slides into my brain like a well-lubricated shit. No wrinkles please. Just looking at a 10-K my grey matter shrivels like a raisin and I don't like it. I come to WSB for those low hanging tendies, but your ugly-ass wall of text DD gives me brain constipation.

# How DD should look:

For the love of the intellectually deficient, **use formatting** to make your posts equal opportunity for the non-savant autists in the crowd. Visual clarity makes my dick hard.

I invest like a lobotomized magpie with currency incontinence. If your post doesn't have a **big shiny ticker** with a **clear call to action**, I'm just going to perch on the next meme stock post and shit on the gay bears as my ignorance reaps blissful returns. Because my rabid attention span jumps around like a coked-up kangaroo, **use** **bold words** so that I can skim and don't have to stretch my brain around comprehending complete sentences. 

Because I am financially illiterate, when you say ""technical analysis"" I hear Tech, $NKLA, and anal cysts. I'm confused. I hurt myself in my confusion. I choose $NKLA. Bad call. For proper direction, I need a big ass arrow and in a three to fours words description, **tell me where to allocate my two brain cells.** 

I've never read a fucking annual report cuz no body got time for that, so if you can't deliver it to me in iconography like the dark ages peasant I am I'll just get my gambling fix from someone with more **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

# Example:

**Big Shiny Ticker:** $GME

**Action Step:** Buy shares/calls before EOW

**Noodle over:** Puts expiring = prices up  **🚀🌕**

Without getting too technical, a group of fucking assholes called Melvin Capital or some shit are knee deep in Puts. They were suppressing the price at 22$ for the past month. Today the price shot up 60% and Melvin is probably having a stroke right now. They will have to eventually buy these shares back from us Autists, institutions, and every other lucky fuck who has a GME share to sell. 

Problem for these boomers, is that the board of $GME holds 20% of the overall stock. On top of that, institutions like Blackrock, Vanguard hold another 20% or so, they will NOT sell. Wall Street Bets has 1.8 million users. Dont underestimate our power. On top of that, Cramer is going to shill this to every boomer today/tommorow. Look at his twitter.

So basically Autists, if we keep buying up GME, Melvin and his boomer friends will be fukt. GME at a $25 Billion market cap means that GME is valued at ~300$/share. 35$ is a STEAL.

Its quite simple. The HF's overplayed their hand, and they got caught.  So bad in fact, that they are DESPERATE to unwind their positions at any and all costs.    


There are 8 million people in this sub now.  Imagine if each one of us sent a complain to the SEC.  How on earth could they ignore us?  My opinion is that we have not done enough campaigning of our own to educate people about what is going on.  Of course all of WSB is familiar with the blatant manipulation, how about your FB friends? How about Twitter? Stocktwits? Other investing forums? That journalist you went to school with? We all have a voice and we NEED to use it.  

We are being owned in the media, and they are controlling OUR narrative.  All people are hearing is that a bunch of punks on WSB bought a bunch of shitty companies making the stock rise and they are all going to loose their money, cause another financial crash, and kill your 401k.  Is that what we did here? Or did we discovery that some HF's fucked up so badly due their ungodly greed that they themselves risked blowing up the ENTIRE financial institution (again) and are breaking every law conceivable trying to bail themselves out?  

That's the message that all 8 million of us should be spreading right now.  I full expect each and every one of you to write to the SEC about what is happening.  The HF's may have the money, but we have the voice!  


*""If you ever thought you were too small to make a difference, try going to sleep with a mosquito in the room""*

So before the downvotes just rub those two brain cells of yours together for a minute to focus on this for the next three minutes. (Fuck you I know what I said)

Due to all of the paper handed bitches, hedge funds shorting, and just general fuckery at the hands of retail trading apps, particularly robinhood, NOK is currently on MASSIVE discount.  Why do I say that? Because the fine folks over at DNB markets, Norway’s leading investment bank, have raised its stock valuation to €4.80, or for those of us who speak freedom, $5.80.

Why does that matter? I hear you starting to ask. Well it matters because it’s currently trading at only $4.53. 

There is over a dollar of pure value just waiting to be claimed. Not to mention it is expecting a very strong earnings report that can cause that value to go up even more. O and the company had been vocal about wanting to start its dividend payments back up. This earnings report should put them on the map for a lot of people.

1. Rumor of settled lawsuits with FB in BB's favor. Should have details within two weeks.
2. BB just sold phone patents to Huwawei. This frees them from their smartphone burdens and gives more capital for their EBIT.
3. BB's CEO just signed a deal where he gets massive $$ if share prices hit $16,$20, and $30.

Expect more volatility during the week. This is my own interpretation of the price action today and is not financial advice. Honestly, I'm a moron with an IQ below 69. I don't have a PT. I let the market tell me that.

&#x200B;

Very strong pre-market activity opening with a 2.5M shares sold to force price below 95.  [Read this post to understand why this 95 level matters. Absolutely on point during today's action.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4207e/gme_options_pricing_expected_and_max_volatility/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) MM needed to defend this price level or hedge above it. At this point in time, for 1/29, there were 25.000 puts ITM and +25.000 calls OTM between 95 - 115. Once the 95 level broke, it was a gamma event like last friday only this time, price shoot-up above the highest strike and all the way to $160. Notice the deceleration after 115 (highest strike) which could mean that MM were completing their hedges. After, I believe we started seeing short covering and margin calls. 22M shares traded hands within 20 minutes as price shoots from 115 to 160 and with $10 dollar bid-ask spreads.   


But then, trading halted and SPY took a violent dive bringing down all equities across the board. Algo trading kicked-in and GME lost 50% in less than 30min. However, unlike the previous increase, less than 10M shares traded hands in that period. Notice how OBV reacted with both moves.

The MM gamma event lost momentum and at exactly noon, when liquidity tends to dry, a big short attack to drive price down to the previous open, only to be countered by some big money purchases to where it currently stands (and likely will close).

&#x200B;

My take on all this is that the tape is showing accumulation at current prices. OI in OTM calls and puts is now close to 200.000 contracts (say actually 15M shares - or half the current float to hedge) for 1/29 alone. Gamma events are not over and if today is any indication, it seems like MMs are more active hedging then last week. With a gap-up at open it should be similar price action.

478,GME,l791fb,2021-01-28 22:13:47,The only way out for $GME is up - bull theory on tomorrow's squeeze (DD),"I know this is long and none of you can read, but bear with me.

As most of you know, stocks can only go down to zero. So the profit for shorts is limited down to zero, and the loss for longs is limited to zero. When stocks go up, the profit for longs is limitless and the loss for shorts is also limitless, theoretically of course. So imagine being short, stuck in a massively losing position where if you push the price down, zero is the best payoff. Ironically this was the bet Melvin made before he got steamrolled by the internet.

But what about if you could go long? The sky is the limit and could theoretically cover more of your losses than trying to go back to zero. $GME closed at $193 today, so if they're still in the hole, all they can try is pushing it to zero and dig the hole deeper which seems like a dumb plan. So this is what I think they're going to do.

Yesterday, the CEO of the Nasdaq suggested a halt to trading to let institutions ""recalibrate"" their positions:

>Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman suggested Wednesday that her exchange could halt trading activity for stocks, in the event they were targeted by internet users, to enable the exchange to investigate possible manipulation and allow investors to “recalibrate.”

>https://www.mediaite.com/news/nasdaq-ceo-suggests-halt-to-trading-to-allow-big-investors-to-recalibrate-their-positions-to-combat-reddit-users/

What if a halt wasn't possible, but they needed a way to kill the momentum of retail buyers and allow $GME to fall? The best solution would be to cut off retail from purchasing/bidding up the price. That's all you need to do. Only let them sell or hold, which would contribute no pricing pressure at all or only downward pressure. This would allow hedge funds price control over $GME so they could move it lower with ladder attacks without having to worry about or battle with retail pushing against them. If anything retail would panic and sell. And thus today we saw a massive attack which brought $GME down over $350.

2.Some short covering has obviously taken place. Some Korean firm I think sold a few million shares they were long. It's a small dent but not enough to fix the problem. And the short volume is up markedly, while the short interest is still over 50 million shares. I've seen higher SI figures and I don't know how Ortex computes this, whether it includes naked shorts or not. But here's the updated graph:

https://i.imgur.com/jnf4ELe.png

So you can see they've covered some bets, probably the biggest losers shorting from like $30 or something. But they seem to have reloaded, as others here and on twitter have reported. **The short volume is up massively and days to cover is at its lower point ever.**

I've read that shorts have to return 30 million shares tomorrow. I have no idea if this is true, but if it is, it means the game is coming to an end and they need to close their position by buying which they will have to do eventually. So the final step after pushing $GME into the dirt and doing some short covering, is to setup positions to go long. $GME hit a low of $112 today. The best way for shorts out is to go long and to do so through derivatives, specifically cheap calls. As most of you know, the further out of the money a call is, the cheaper it is. Now I don't know what the $570 strike expiring tomorrow was trading at when $GME hit $112 (I just wish I had bought some). But it's currently less than $1k and was much cheaper earlier. And more importantly, over 12,000 of these were bought TODAY. Normally I'd attribute these 0DTE cheap moonshots to the retar, erm, traders here. But considering most of you can't buy right now, and that Robinhood has never allowed 0DTE options purchases, I have to think this was institutional buying:

https://imgur.com/DOqIA8T

Some people have mentioned holding through the weekend as calls would expire ITM. Wouldn't they want to avoid that by getting the squeeze done and over with so they expire OTM? Just a thought.

If I'm right, and the shorts have loaded up on 0DTE moonshot calls and are ready to stop playing games and exit, they will let this thing finally fly now that they can make a ton of money on the upside through calls.

The ride up will be swift and so will the ride back down. The best way for them to play this is to position themselves with calls at the bottom (today), then start the unloading of their short positions through buying and let it ride as high as they can to cover however deep they are. And once that ends, they will cash in the calls, which will cause MMs to sell off their delta-hedged shares behind those calls, shorts will stop buying any more shares, and probably short the price back down because they're greedy fucks. All of this would send the price plummeting right after a top. Fortunately we have circuit breakers now which I don't think existed back when VW went to the moon. Look at a chart of the VW Squeeze:

https://imgur.com/E5QShAp

See how the stock fell beforehand...probably to let shorts reposition themselves for the inevitable. Is that happening today? Maybe. The point is it's very violent up and then back down. The squeeze on VW all happened in one day, perhaps over hours or less. So you have to be ready.

How high does it go? I would expect anything above $500 is risky (but I dream of $1k+ like the rest of you). Whether they load up on $50 calls or $500 calls both will go up along with the price. You never know where the top is so have a game plan. The top is wherever they need it to be to get right with God (the banks backing them). So be ready and realistic. If you can't watch charts, set a sell limit (I know, I know). But please don't diamond hands major profits to nothing by going through a squeeze and not selling because you're also a greedy fuck. I've been a member of this autistic playground long enough to watch diamond hands go to zero, repeatedly. I nearly went extinct as a gay bear myself for diamond-handing puts into the summer after the market crashed in March.

Positions and disclosures:

* 19 Feb 21 $400 Call x 2
* 19 Feb 21 $150 Call x 3
* 20 shares (lol)
* -$100k or +$250k, we'll see what happens.

This is not financial advice and I'm no insider, just a retar...trader like the rest of you. Do not risk what you cannot afford to lose. Good luck. Hope to see you all on the moon, because after all the shit they've pulled with $GME, you deserve it.

Edit: I never said don't hold past $500. I think that could be the floor for when this kicks off. But I have no idea when it ends. I'm not trying to scare you to sell. I just don't want anyone here to baghold. It's always brutal to see and this is easily the biggest play WSB has rallied around.

483,DD,lbt8yz,2021-02-03 18:43:33,Bull Case for AMC - DD from a Hollywood Film Producer-Director,"\*Not Financial Advice. Entertainment purposes only.   
I work in the film & tv industry in Hollywood. I was bearish on AMC for 2021 because of the pandemic. Our industry pretty much shut down and our local productions, while still going on, are pricey due to the many restrictions and guidelines set forth by our state. 

But recent events with GME made me take a deep dive into the numbers, and well, AMC actually looks pretty good. I nearly forgot that studios like Paramount, Universal, Disney, etc. are bagholding their slate of tentpole movies (movies with budgets well over 200-million) because it doesn't make any sense to stream them.

**Quick Facts:**  
1) AMC received a fresh infusion of cash through the stonks.   
2) And this was after AMC received loans in the north of 100-million.  
**And here's the banger:**  
3) AMC has 2-years worth of tentpole movies from all the major studios waiting for release. This includes Tenet (projected 1.5-billion), Mulan, Wonder Woman, Top Gun 2, Fast and the Furious, Bond, Pixar's Soul, Space Jam and many many more.  A typical year might have three of these. 

This is bad for the studies because their ""great"" movies now have to compete for market share in a saturated market, but for AMC, it's a great problem to have. It's like having 2 Christmas's in one day. 

**Pent-Up Demand:**  
Box office ticket sales, pre-pandemic, have been around 10-11-billion dollars per year. AMC has the dominant market share and had been generating about 5 to 5.5-billion in revenue (from ticket sales and concessions). 

When Japan re-opened their theaters, Demon Slayer became the number one grossing movie of all time. Pundits believed that the Japanese would've probably watched anything that was released at that point due to pent-up demand. 

If the pent-up demand hypothesis is true, then late 2021 might have the biggest, most profitable quarter ever for AMC, and 2022 will be even bigger. Forward guidance reported in any 2021 quarter's earnings will foster great optimism, and due to secular factors and the fed's push for lower interest rates, we might see some of the best numbers 

**Another possibility:**  
If Japan cancels the Olympics (likely), that opens up another 2-3-month window of time for studios to schedule their releases. For example, instead of Wonder Woman competing for August's 1-billion market share with Pixar's Soul, Soul could release in August, and Wonder Woman could release in October, etc. This means more efficient releases and more dinero for AMC. 

TL;DR - Pent-up demand, likely near-term re-opening due to vaccines, the fact that major film studios are bag-holding tentpole movies and will do whatever it takes to release them to the market when AMC still has the lead market share of theatrical ticket sales makes me MEGA bullish on AMC.",DD,0.91

36mil in volume is not a lot! These guys shorted around $5 so unless the stock hits $5 you're fine. Even then, you're fine if we don't sell. Don't be paper handed. Most retailers are still holding.

This is a once in a lifetime chance. Red is just a color, it will change if you hold and buy the dip. I plan on buying more near end of day myself!

**The short itself will probably happen after Thursday Feb. 4th.** This is because that would be the 13th consecutive day of Failure to Deliver on a threshold security. But this only happens if the shorts can't deliver the shares they owe. They're trying to illegally drive the price down so when they buy back they can avoid a squeeze. I'm a literal retard, but I have a feeling the price is gonna start going back up on Thursday or next week. Maybe someone can explain more

**Retail investors own over 100% of the actual shares. This means the price goes as high as we want it to go. It will keep climbing until we sell. They are using every trick in the book because they know they're f*cked! This is literally free money if we all hold. There is nothing they can do but try to scare you.**

I sold my meager 40 shares like a paper handed bitch a few days ago, but have seen the error of my ways and I've been buying back in. I'm going to buy over 40 shares this time to make up for it. HOOOOOLD.

Lastly, remember to remove your stop losses so you don't sell!

492,APHA,lbaww3,2021-02-03 01:24:57,DD on APHA,"I think it is time I make a DD post that has nothing to do with a meme stonk. I am unable to use emojis off my laptop so please excuse me for not having enough rocket ships but I promise you this rocket ship is fueling up and we are a couple months away from blast off if not sooner.

Why should you trust me?

I am an economics major with a concentration in entrepreneurship and a minor in sales. I love money more than hookers love blow and I intend on making a lot of money so I can afford the hookers that like blow. I go to a pretty prestigious university and I love how WallStreetBets can connect ""smart"" money with ""autist"" money. I am 100% all in on APHA with my entire life savings because as Warren Buffett would say, "" ""**Diversification** is a protection against ignorance,"" ""\[It\] makes very little sense for those who know what they're doing.""  and I know what I am doing so I full sent it.

&#x200B;

Why APHA?

They are conservative with their spending is what got me hooked first. Compared to other marijuana companies like ACB or Tilray, they aren't riddled with debt right off the back. (i'll get to the Tilray merger in a bit). This company has the cash on hand to purchase a MSO (multi-state operator) as soon as the US legalizes and my bet is that they are going to go for a MSO that has a heavy presence in Florida as the CFO stated in an AMA on reddit that Florida is where the market is, not California. The difference between APHA and any MSO or other LP is the fact that APHA merging with Tilray creates the first MCO or Multi-country operator. This means the company will be taking a piece of the cake from multiple cakes. You don't need to be #1 in America or Canada whenever you are directly engaged in multiple operations all over the world that increase your market share to be #1 worldwide.

&#x200B;

With APHA and Tilray merging... which stonk do you buy? Easy, APHA.

The arbitrage play has APHA being changed to .83 of 1 Tilray share.

Currently tilray trades at 24.95 x 0.83 = 20.708

The current APHA price? 15.25.

This means that the gap has to close before the merger but is Tilray going to go down with all the pro marijuana news coming out? No, APHA has to go up to close the gap and today alone APHA is up 17.92% based on pro marijuana legalization news. BUT WAIT! Tilray is up 22.98% which means the GAP IS ONLY GETTING WIDER just like your wife's pussy after letting her 5 boyfriends have a turn since you've been so busy focusing on your GME stonk going down due to market manipulation.

&#x200B;

The financials of APHA are strong, they FINALLY posted a profit of 0.01 EPS which may seem like little bitch shit but in reality most cannabis companies haven't hit profitability yet so they are ahead of the game. The one great thing about their financials is that Sweetwater Brewing wasn't factored into the earnings report which is AWESOME (Insert hellllaaa rocket emojis here). They are already turning a profit and THEN they are going to be adding more profits from a brewery that has strong revenue growth and turns a profit onto their balance sheet. While other companies have to figure out how to keep demand up after the holiday season, APHA has a raft to float on since Sweetwater provides a great level of float to the company. (I will post all relevant news articles at the end). The merge with Tilray makes this combined company a player in, Canada, Portugal, France, and then Sweetwater gives them US brand recognition. How does a beer company give US brand recognition? Look up the Sweetwater brand and you will see that this is a beer company for stoners and that is exactly what APHA needed. Right now the stock is stilling at $15 which is still relatively low, I can see this hitting anywhere from $50-75 EOY and like I said, I have my entire life savings in this stonk because I know the end of prohibition means the chance for the next Anheuser Busch which APHA is best positioned to become.

There's even more reasons to invest but I'm sure you get the point. This is going to be huge and if you're looking for a play in the marijuana sector this is your best option. Go on the weedstocks subreddit if you want even more verification or to see some alternative opinions. I made this post as a throwback to the good ole days to when WSB wasn't only about GME and AMC but also new emerging sectors. This is a great stock and I wouldn't have taken the time out of my busy schedule unless the time to blast off was fast approaching. Listen or don't I am gonna make tendies, I just want to share the wealth.

Sweetwater is actually a very big deal that is overlooked. They are expanding into more states which is simply creating a distribution chain for APHA/Tilray to distribute their product through. Imagine already having warehouses, sales reps, and shipping routes established before the US legalizes. APHA is going to be an MSO and MCO. The only thing that scares me is that democrats have said they don't want big companies coming in to sweep up market share whenever minorities have been directly impacted by the war on drugs. Could go both ways but Sweetwater provides somewhat of a foundation for the balance sheet and then the intrinsic value of the relationships/brand recognition that will already be established before any other LPs can get into the market will have APHA/Tilray the clear cut winner of the LPs. I strongly urge anyone that wants to get further into the marijuana investing space to visit the sub reddit Weedstocks rather than spamming WSB with these types of posts whenever their is a different sub dedicated to it. I have been a member of WSB and Weedstocks for over a year and both subs have their pros and cons.

HEY RETARDS, STOP BUYING AMC, BB, NOK, SLV, OR LITERALLY ANYTHING BESIDES GME. THE MEDIA AND HEDGE FUNDS ARE TRYING TO DISTRACT YOU FROM THE FACT THAT GME IS THE ONLY STOCK THAT MATTERS. **LITERALLY ANY OTHER STOCK ON THE MARKET THAT IS NOT GME IS A DISTRACTION.** 

THIS IS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME GOLDEN FUCKING TICKET TO u/deepfuckingvalue's TENDIE FACTORY.

$1,000 IS A JOKE. $10,000 IS CONSERVATIVE. $100,000 IS POSSIBLE IF WE STOP BUYING INTO THEIR BULLSHIT AND HOLD THE FUCKING LINE. 

I LOVE YOU ALL, BUT SOME OF YOU ARE NAIVE AND OBLIVIOUS AS FUCK.

MAKE THEM SUFFER FOR ALL OF THE BULLSHIT THEY'VE PULLED ON US OVER THE YEARS. 

CONSIDER THIS TO BE FORCED REPARATIONS PAYMENTS FOR 2008. 

FUCK THE SUITS. POWER TO THE PLAYERS. 

Positions: WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK? ALL IN GME🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

EDIT: Thank you to all of the brilliant economists in the comments for letting me know that $100,000 per share would crumble the global financial system. No shit. It's obviously not going to happen, but in theory it could. If literally every single person held, the hedge funds' prime lenders would have to liquidate everything and pay us whatever ransom we want. 

**FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO WEAR HELMETS IN THEIR CARS: The point is that we are in control, NOT that you're going to make $100,000 per share.**

EDIT 2: Holy shit it's worse than I thought. If you can't afford GME, respect. Buy some AMC and fuck the suits that way--but for the people who can afford to choose, **GME IS THE ONLY ONE WITH A SHORT INTEREST WAY ABOVE 100%.**
I like AMC, BB, and NOK, too, but I really don't think you guys understand the GME situation. We caught the bastards who have been fucking us our whole lives with their pants down. They have shorted more shares than exist. We own the shares. BUT THIS IS ONLY TRUE OF GME. (Yes I know AMC has a huge short interest too, but GME is on a whole different level.)",Discussion,0.87
